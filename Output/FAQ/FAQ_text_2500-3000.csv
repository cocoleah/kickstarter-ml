4,2504,"["" What made you think if ever using clothespins? It all started in 2002 when I made a dress out of clothespins for my best friend. Lacking time, funds and any knowledge about making clothing, I went to a Dollar Store in Miami Beach and that was it. Sort of a joke, in turned into an ongoing series of art that does not seem to have a end. Thu, Mar 21 2013 3:53 pm EDT How long does it take to make something like this? That is hard to judge. Needless to say, I have become very fast through the years but still, it is labor intensive and requires of my natural patience. The most tedious part of the process is drilling 2 holes on each of the thousands of clothespins. No one seems to be as fast as I, thus I do it all myself. Then I create sections that are later connected and so forth. In between I work on other things, sculptures, paintings or house chores as needed. This particular project has very little time to complete and ship to the location so I will be testing all that I have learned in the past few years. The installation is always the most exciting and rewarding part of the project, making it all worth it. Thu, Mar 21 2013 3:53 pm EDT What is the largest piece you ever made out of clothespins? Not large in size but in numbers, the one I did for SCULPTED GREEN exhibition at the City of Bellevue WA City Hall in 2008. It was made of about 12 thousand wood clothespins. Largest in size, the one at The Hive dinning hall at the Savannah College of Art & Design with a combined length of over 60'. In the near future I hope to either get a grant or a Public Art Commission that will allow me to create the largest one so far, and possibly be able to included it in the Guinness Book of records... why not, right?

We realize journalists have a million things going on, so we try to make this as easy and as effortless as possible. We welcome as much creative and editorial input as our contributors want/are able to give. Sometimes journalists provide us with a 45-minute interview and say: ""have at it."" Or maybe they point us towards a particular must-hear portion of the tape. We then cull through the material and turn into something new. During the production process we can share scripts and audio drafts. We also love to record a short interview with the journalist, so they can paint the picture of the interview, the scene, the backstory, etc. That is what makes these interviews, these voyeuristic sound bites, so different.

21,2521,"["" What is the recommended age for MudWatt? MudWatt is designed for a wide range of ages, from elementary school to college and beyond. The more advanced the user, the deeper they dive into the awesome science that makes MudWatt work!   Little kids like playing with dirt (who doesn't?), whereas big kids can experiment with what beer is most powerful!  (the answer may surprise you) Mon, Mar 23 2015 9:38 pm EDT How long will the MudWatt last? The truth is we don't know...we've had one run for 3 YEARS already!  Once a MudWatt has developed a healthy community of electrogenic (electricity-generating) microbes, it will continue to produce power until you run out of nutrients. We've run the numbers, and power production could last decades as long as you keep your bacteria happy. Mon, Mar 23 2015 9:38 pm EDT How much power will my MudWatt produce? Your MudWatt's power output depends on what you feed it and the position of the electrodes - that's how you run experiments! We encourage users think about what microbes would like to eat and to design their own fuels using different soils and whatever they find in their fridge. With standard topsoils, typical power levels are around 100 microWatts, which is enough to power the LED, buzzer, clock, or other small gadgets. Mon, Mar 23 2015 9:38 pm EDT ?  ""]"

LissommeX is creating a new generation of waist trainers that allows everyone to quickly require the healthy and sexy waist curves they desire; The company is created by a woman who is 38, a mom of two, enthusiast both in fashion and workout, and an expert in the waist training area. Sat, Feb 29 2020 9:49 am EST Where is LissommeX located? Mon, Feb 24 2020 12:17 pm EST What is your return policy? Please be aware that returns or refunds are not available on this Kickstarter campaign promotion Mon, Feb 24 2020 12:17 pm EST What is waist training? Waist training is a healthy process of shrinking your waist size by wearing a natural rubber latex waist trainer,. When wearing it daily, a waist trainer will gradually reshape your waist into an hourglass figure by compressing and repositioning your body fat. Also known as waist cinching, this practice came to prominence during Victorian times and has remained relevant because of it's proven results. They need to be worn 4-6 hours a day, and be very tight. The compression also reduces hunger since they are tight, and they help improve posture and back pain as well. In mordern days people inherited this technique but improved it to provide a more comfortable expereince. After 30 days you will notice a significant difference in your mid section. Our customers have dropped  2-3 dress sizes in this timeframe. Mon, Feb 24 2020 12:17 pm EST How do I choose the correct size waist trainer? The most reliable method to choosing the correct size waist trainer is to measure your waist right above your navel and refer to the size chart to find the corresponding size. You can also go by height/and weight, but keep in mind that this is a general method only since we all hold our weight differently. We recommend measuring. If you are in doubt, or between sizes, choose one size up. Our waist trainers are meant to fit very tight, and may need help getting it on the first time until it breaks in a bit. If you need help choosing a size, please email us at support@lissommex.com  or visit this page http://www.lissommex.com/index.php?route=information/information&information_id=9 Mon, Feb 24 2020 12:17 pm EST CanI wear it if I am allergic to rubber? Even though we use the best quality natural rubber in the market to reduce the risk of allergy. If you have been diagnosed with a rubber or latex allergy, we don’t recommend that you buy it Sat, Feb 29 2020 9:49 am EST Can I wear it for sports, fitness and everyday? Yes, LissommeX is suitable for three major use scenarios: daily wear can help correct posture and create an hourglass waist. Wearing it to protect your waist and abdomen when you workout. It can also be worn postpartum to help prevent internal organs from sagging. Mon, Feb 24 2020 12:17 pm EST What are the advantages of 15 strands? 9 strands focus on shaping, but they are prone to folds when worn for a long time, which affects comfort. 25 strands reduce wrinkles, but they are insufficient in shaping and the waist curve is not obvious enough. The 15 strands selected by Lissommex have better support and do not affect the comfort, less prone to wrinkles, better support in the front abdomen, and do not affect the hourglass effect. Sat, Feb 29 2020 9:49 am EST Will my chest be squeezed? No. LissommeX adopts a unique chest support design, and the unique chest curve design perfectly fits the chest shape. We calculated the perfect length- long enough to cover your skin, but not so long that it will poke into your chest. Sat, Feb 29 2020 9:49 am EST Do you feel stuffy when you wear it?

71,2571,"[' What is mead? In its \'purest\' form, mead is simply honey diluted in water and fermented. Sat, Jul 14 2018 10:58 pm EDT What else can mead be made with? First off, to be mead, the fermented sugar must come from honey.  Aside from that, the honey may be mixed with water in its most basic form, or fruit juice may be used. Any fruit used other than apple or grapes, produces what is known as \'melomel.\' Sat, Jul 14 2018 10:58 pm EDT What is mead called if you make it with apple juice or grapes then?  Cider and mead wine? Glad you asked~!  Mead made with apple juice or cider, is called \'Cyser.\'  I prefer the Latin pronunciation for this which sounds like \'Kaiser.\'   If grapes are used, you will produce mead known as \'pyment.\' Cyser has a definite cider flavor to it and pyment does taste more like wine to the pallet.  For this reason, I don\'t make pyment as being a bit of a mead-pusher, I find it confuses people when they taste something that is supposed to be so different from wine and yet tastes like wine. Sat, Jul 14 2018 10:58 pm EDT What makes mead so different from wine if they can taste the same? Wine is defined as an alcoholic beverage produced by fermenting plant fruit or parts.  Mead is made by fermenting an insect product, honey.  The dry variety of mead can taste very much like a white wine. Wed, Jul 18 2018 4:37 am EDT Why is mead called honey wine? The term honey wine is misappropriated from the term \'honeyed-wine.\'  Honeyed-wine refers to wine to which honey has been added to sweeten it.  This was a practice done in Italy during the Renaissance period to make the dry wines of the court more palatable for the ladies of the court.  Over time and with first disuse and then misuse, the term has changed to honey wine in referring to mead.  Mead is no more wine, than wine is beer or beer a distilled spirit.   There is no proper Federal definition for mead specifically. Sat, Jul 14 2018 10:58 pm EDT Why is mead considered a wine? Mead should not be considered a wine any more than wine should be considered a distilled spirit.  By Federal Law, alcoholic beverages fall into one of three categories: beer if produced with the addition of hops and grains (hops specifically), wine if the fermented product is plant parts or fruit, or distilled spirits if the alcohol is produced by distillation. Mead is produced by fermenting an insect product.  What can confuse the issue is if grapes are used to make a pyment mead, or using hops to make a braggot mead. Wed, Jul 18 2018 4:37 am EDT What is braggot mead? Mead can be made by flavoring it with fruits, herbs, spices, hops, grains, etc.  Using apples will produce cyser as noted above, but when hops are used to flavor mead during fermentation, what is produced is a mead called braggot.  This type of mead as a decided \'ale\' flavor. For this reason, while there is absolutely nothing wrong with making mead in this fashion, I leave this flavor for others to produce as we rather promote a strikingly different flavor in our mead rather than make a product easily confused with the ordinary palate of flavors.  Beer lovers will certainly find this type of mead very familiar in the same way people that prefer wine will like pyment as it tastes much more like a typical wine. Sat, Jul 14 2018 10:58 pm EDT Have you mispelled \'days\' in your brand name? Great Question~!  When we asked Philip this question, he pointed out that few ask it.  He wanted to answer it himself so....Philip? "" \'Roman Daze\' was coined as my brand a very long time ago.  There is a funny story that goes along with it and I am sure it will be told many times in the meadery.  I won\'t get into that here so let me just say this.  The recipe I used for my first batch of mead was a 2000 year old recipe I had researched.  After applying some modern science and techniques, I produced a mead that is most pleasant to drink and seemingly innocent in effects when drank while seated...until one stood up!  Some called it \'dazzling,\' some simply said they felt \'dazed,\' so as a nod to the source, I like the play on words."" Sun, Jul 15 2018 3:45 pm EDT What makes Roman Daze mead different from other meads I can find? There are a number of things we can point to but if we have to pick one, it would be that our mead is a stronger mead than what is commonly found. To make such strong mead takes a lot of honey, up to three times more honey than it takes to make mead like many of the others available on the market.  That is only the first part, making the alcohol.  Once this level of alcohol is produced, it must be balanced by the honey so that a pleasing drink is the result. Wed, Jul 18 2018 4:37 am EDT Why do you make such strong mead? To make sack requires a lot of experience and know how.  There are many difficulties that must be overcome when making sack.  If you read about the process online, you will find many sources say to produce a mead in excess of 12% alcohol is not possible.  This is because of the difficulties involved and the general lack of expertise people making mead have.  It has taken a long time for Philip to get to the level of expertise he has so as to perfect the process of making sack.  As it is a variety of mead not commonly found, he prefers to make it. Mead can be made in a great range in both sweetness and level of alcohol.  There are three types of mead generally and the classification is directly related to the level of alcohol found in the mead. Hydromel- this is best compared to a high density beer or hard cider for the level of alcohol.  This is typically the least sweet, or \'driest\' of the meads you will generally find. Standard- most comparable to table wine.  Most meads in this range will be finished like a dry white wine with a tendency to the dry end of sweetness. Sack- Generally best compared to a Port wine or dessert wine.  These are the sweetest of the meads you will find as the extra honey is required to mask the otherwise strong alcohol bite which without a good balanced finish, is very distasteful.  Alcohol level can be as high as 22-25%.  Philip likes to produce mead in the 16-18% range as they are strong, but not so strong as to be reduced to drinking shots.  He still promotes a full horn to enjoy the mead Daze~! Wed, Jul 18 2018 4:37 am EDT I am new to mead.  When I look to buy a bottle, I get a little sticker shock at the price sometime. Why does mead cost so much? Good question and one that history rather addresses.   Until the art of fermentation was understood, mead was pretty much the only alcoholic beverage available and its production was attributed to the gods.  After fermentation was understood, wine began to supplant mead in availability and use simply because grapes are cheaper to use in the process than honey. Once distilled spirits came on the scene, mead disappeared from preference after thousands of years.  It was cheaper to produce a higher level of alcohol by distillation and people moved to \'the-bigger-bang for their buck \' for simple economic reasons. Mead is seeing a new return to favor but the base materials are still more expensive to produce it.  The process also takes longer than beer or distilled spirits.  The struggle the bees have been facing for the last ten years has also driven the price of honey up, hence driving the price up additionally. Wed, Jul 18 2018 4:37 am EDT I have heard mead is the oldest alcoholic beverage known to man.  Why is it just now becoming known? For millennia mead was the only alcoholic beverage, this is true.  It fell out of vogue due to more cheaply produced and stronger drink coming available with the advent of distilled spirits. It has been out of circulation for several hundred years and today it has a very different taste from what we otherwise have available to drink and for that reason many people are moving to mead as a choice simply because it is something different and \'new.\'  There are a few other reasons... Wed, Jul 18 2018 4:37 am EDT What is another reason for the rise in meads new found popularity? The alcohol carried into your system by mead has a very different effect on the body.  All other alcohol is absorbed thru the intestines, then into the bloodstream and filtered by the liver and kidneys before it may be generally felt.  This may take 30-45 minutes.   The human body reacts to mead as the perfect food because of the honey it contains, which -is- the perfect food.  Honey is the only food which is absorbed into the body directly thru the stomach lining.  From there it enters the bloodstream and the first stop is...the brain. The effect of having had 4-6 ounces of mead can be felt in as little as 10 minutes. Sun, Jul 15 2018 2:07 am EDT I understand you make strong mead.   I have had some of it and it truly is quite powerful.  I haven\'t had one of your horns of mead yet, what kind of hangover does it deliver? Naturally, everyone is different.  Not being chemists or biologists, we asked this question of Philip as he is both.  His response was simple~ ""Most of the hangover from drinking too much beer comes from the additives, including formaldehyde, in the beer.  Dehydration also is a major factor.  Roman Daze mead contains no chemical additives, no stabilizers, and no preservatives.  It is a totally natural product.  We encourage responsible drinking and as with all alcoholic beverages, know your limits.  Off the record- should you overindulge, you may find when you wake up, the greatest desire you may have is to have something to drink.  Everyone metabolizes alcohol and sugar differently so I can\'t speak for you and your results unless I know you.  I can tell you this- you shouldn\'t get a sour stomach from mead unless it has additives in it or your body has trouble with sugars.  That being said, everyone is different, so I can\'t say.  I will tell you this~  don\'t drink a full horn of our mead alone~!  You may end up spilling a good share of it and it is always more fun to share it with a friend~!"" Sun, Jul 15 2018 2:07 am EDT I consider myself to be somewhat of a mead-snob.  Roman Daze mead is distinctly different from nearly every other mead I have had.  What makes your mead so darn good? Thank you for that comment~ and question.  We asked Philip this question and he said you have cut to the chase.  What you have asked gets to what he considers \'trade secrets\' and unless you are making a batch of mead with him he isn\'t inclined to answer in print. Philip has also written a book detailing his process and he would rather you read all he has to say about it rather than take a simple answer and think that was all there was to it. One thing we can tell you is that we use a hot cooking technique in making our mead as Philip knows the secret to getting the subtle flavors our of our ingredients.  Other than this, there are a number of other things we do in handling our ingredients, as well as our process that contribute to making our mead.  Philip also has an old world palate when it comes to finishing his mead.  Rather than finish it to taste like a dry white wine, Philip finishes it to have a distinctly different mouthfeel and balance.  He has an adage we use around the meadery...\'it the honey isn\'t in the nose and the finish, its not mead.\' Wed, Jul 18 2018 4:37 am EDT How do you make your mead so sparkling clear?  It looks alive in the glass~!  Do you use force filtration? This is another question we had to put to Philip for an answer.  Philip believes in ancient techniques and force filtration is a fairly new process to brewing.  When asked, Philip simply said, ""flocculation.  We use a characteristic of the yeast itself to clarify our mead.  Flocculation."" WELL...we hope you know what he is talking about because we don\'t know what the floc he is talking about...  8 )  Pardon our pun, he assured us it is quite particulate.  At least we think that is what he said. Sun, Jul 15 2018 2:27 am EDT So you don\'t use force filtration to clarify your mead.  Why not? Another good technical question.  Philip, will you please answer this one? Philip~ \'Sure thing.  I am convinced that forced filtration removes certain subtle characteristics from mead that would otherwise contribute to such things as mouth feel, sweetness, palate, finish and bouquet.  My process is slower, no doubt, but the end result is obvious in the finished product.  I have a very sophisticated palate after making mead for over 30 years and force filtration simply takes too many \'essentials\' out of the mead with the particulates.  There is another way, one that has been used for millennia.  It may take longer, but if you want quality, sometimes you have to put a little patience into the product and let nature take its course.\' Sun, Jul 15 2018 2:27 am EDT I have been reading your FAQ\'s and find that most of your answers leave me with another question.  Am I missing something? When Philip read your question he chuckled.  Then he smirked and said, ""Thank you for your comment.  You aren\'t missing anything.  In fact, you are \'getting it.\'  A good instructor should always answer the question, but must encourage the student to listen, integrate, and think.  You are a good student and observant.  Do you know what mead made with herbs and spices is called?"" Sun, Jul 15 2018 3:50 pm EDT Okay...Cyser~ apple mead, Pyment~ grape mead, Braggot~ hopped mead, Fruits~ melomel mead, Sack~ Strong mead...so what is mead called if you make it with herbs and spices? We are glad you asked.  Actually our most popular recipe we grabbed from Philip\'s nearly 20 year old recipe he has been calling \'Newton\'s Fall\',  It is made with Apple blossoms, rose hips, roasted chicory, and hibiscus.  This style of mead, flavored with herbs and spices before fermentation, is called a metheglin.  Philip tells us he had some unexpected visitors after he posted on social media he was making meth-eglin~!   DOH! Sun, Jul 15 2018 2:50 am EDT Why is your mead so sweet? The quick answer is it has honey in it.  A lot of it.   A more thorough answer would be that compared to the mead you may have had before, most of our recipes produce sack which contains much more alcohol than other types of mead.  Without a sweet finish, the level of alcohol present is generally unpleasant to taste. Sun, Jul 15 2018 2:50 am EDT ?  ']"

Rocketbook Everlast is available on this Kickstarter campaign. The Rocketbook Wave can is not endlessly reusable (reusing 5-20 times is realistic).  The Rocketbook Everlast is endlessly reusable (reusing over 1000 times is realistic). Both the Rocketbook Wave and Rocketbook Everlast work with Pilot FriXion pens. The Rocketbook Wave can be reused by heating in your microwave oven. The Rocketbook Everlast can be reused by wiping the page clean with a moist towel. Don't put the Everlast in the microwave. The binding and the cover of the Everlast are more durable since it's design isn't constrained to microwavable materials. The Rocketbook Wave pages are a cellulose formulation. The Rocketbook Everlast pages are made of a waterproof synthetic poly blend. Fri, Nov 18 2016 10:30 am EST Can I heat the Everlast notebook to erase it? Erase your Everlast by applying moisture and wiping it off. The Rocketbook Wave (available at GetRocketbook.com) is designed to be microwave safe, so you can erase the whole notebook with heat in the microwave (or use a strong hairdryer, page by page) When you reuse the Rocketbook Wave, slight residue from clear ink remains on the page, so it's not endlessly reusable like the Everlast is. We customers who tell us that they use the Rocketbook Wave over 20 times but we say it's good for 5 uses to set expectations modest. The Rocketbook Everlast is really an endlessly reusable Rocketbook. Fri, Nov 18 2016 10:32 am EST What if I leave ink on the page for a long time? We tested ink on left on the page for 3 months, 2 months, 1 month, 3 weeks, 2 weeks, 1 week. When ink was left on the page for 2 months or more, the writing left behind a very subtle ghosting. You really have to be in good light and look very closely to notice it. It doesn't interfere with writing over it, future reusability, or scanning. After ink is left on the page for 1 month or less, erasing was perfect and the page was pristine. Fri, Nov 18 2016 10:32 am EST Will moisture degrade the pages? The Everlast pages are a sythnetic poly blend that are impervious to water. Fri, Nov 18 2016 10:32 am EST Will my notes wipe off easily? Dry ink cures great to the page and won't wipe off the page.  Introduce some water (a moist towel is recommended), and it will wipe off easily and perfectly. Fri, Nov 18 2016 10:40 am EST Where can I find replacement Pilot FriXion pens? Your Rocketbook Everlast comes with one FriXion pen and we offer add-ons of 3 packs for convenience. But you don't need to buy replacements from us. FriXion pens are made by Pilot and are available in many stores, like Staples, Walmart, Target, and Amazon.com (http://amzn.to/2eNPYCs) Fri, Nov 18 2016 10:40 am EST I'm left handed, anything I should know? If your hand tends to drag across your words as you write, then the Everlast is not for you. When writing with FriXion gel inks on the Everlast, it takes 10+ seconds for the ink to dry and be resistant to smudging. Also, if you don't like the coil on the left side of your book, then the Everlast might not be a good fit (yet).  In the future we may provide steno-style books that are bound at the top, but at this time we haven't committed to doing so.

First off, the term ""natural"" is unregulated by the FDA. Most ""all-natural"" skincare products aren\'t truly ""natural"". Even those made with natural ingredients aren\'t organic, meaning they aren\'t the best quality. Or they contain potentially inflammatory natural ingredients, like oats, corn, and soy, which are commonly genetically modified. We went through great lengths to go above and beyond delivering another typical ""all-natural"" skincare product, from ingredients to packaging. We have personally met all our sourcers and have verified our ingredients come from legitimate, trustworthy places. Drifter Organics is free of any inflammatory ingredients. Our products are plant-based, vegan, gluten/corn/soy/paraben-free, and non-GMO. They are made in an organic and gluten-free facility. Developing a product with pure, organic ingredients is our top priority. Absolutely no filler ingredients here! The money we raise from our Kickstarter will help us get certified organic by Oregon Tilth—the highest seal of organic certification. In a world full of chemicals, we promise you cannot get any more natural than this. Wed, Mar 30 2016 3:02 pm EDT What is the full list of ingredients for all your products?

For reference, the largest iPad Pro is 12.9 inches, and a standard sized iPad is 10.5 inches. The key area is thickness. If you measure your device with the case on, it will fit as long as it’s under 0.6” thick. Almost all cases work, including most of the ultra-protective ones like Otterbox. Thu, Mar 1 2018 12:17 pm EST When will I get my MYSA? Take a look at our estimated production timeline on the Campaign page. We fully expect to begin shipping out MYSAs in August 2018, and it could be even sooner. We’ll send out update emails throughout the production process, so you’ll always be in the loop. Thu, Mar 1 2018 12:17 pm EST How do you know if I want my MYSA(s) in black or white? We’ll collect that information from you as soon as the campaign is over. You will get an email survey from us, so keep an eye out for that in early April. Thu, Mar 1 2018 12:17 pm EST Can I mix and match between the black and white versions? Yes! If you choose a reward with multiple MYSAs, you are free to mix and match as much as you like. When we send out the backer email surveys in early April once the campaign ends, you will have the freedom to choose. Thu, Mar 1 2018 12:17 pm EST Why hasn’t Kickstarter taken my shipping information? To protect backers information, Kickstarter does not require shipping information until the campaign is officially over.

Mon, Mar 2 2020 2:27 pm EST Why are they wet-erase-marker compatible (and not dry erase)? Initially, our plan was for them to be dry erase. But we changed that up after testing because we realized that dry erase ink rubs off easily with friction, and we wanted you to be able to stack these cards, shuffle them around, and bring them to and from your facilitations — all with your notes still intact. Mon, Mar 2 2020 2:27 pm EST Why are the cards waterproof? To make them extra durable!

Mon, Mar 2 2020 2:27 pm EST Why are you making these if you can print them at home? The do-it-yourself Facilitator Cards are great (we’ve been using them for years in our facilitation), but the decks we’re creating together through Kickstarter are going to knock our socks off. A deck that will last forever (instead of needing to be remade), that’s waterproof, that is easy to write and erase on, and that just feels amazing to use.

Spring or Fall, this jacket is best suited for temperatures above 40ºF/5ºC Mon, Oct 14 2019 10:27 pm EDT How thick can the lining materials be? We accept most clothing items with a few exceptions for things like winter coats, leather, or lace. After the purchase of your jacket, you will receive a “Do Not Send” list. This will help clarify what items we do not accept. If you have further questions don’t hesitate to contact us at info@dhana.com Mon, Oct 14 2019 10:27 pm EDT Can I send in mixed materials or textures? Yes of course.

Mon, Oct 14 2019 10:27 pm EDT Is there any way I can prioritize the garments I send for placement? No, due to the nature of this jacket our team confined to the limitations of the clothes they receive. We cannot guarantee any specific placement or requests however, you are welcome to share your comments and we will take it into consideration. Mon, Oct 14 2019 10:27 pm EDT Does Dhana design for zero waste? What is done with the scraps? Yes, Dhana saves all cutting room scraps.

Mon, Oct 14 2019 10:27 pm EDT What is your returns policy? We do not honor returns as this is a custom made to order product. However, if your jacket is incorrect in any way or needs some repair please contact us at info@dhana.com and we will correct any issues. Mon, Oct 14 2019 10:27 pm EDT Can you elaborate on the exterior shell of the memory jacket, what material is it? The outer fabric is made of deadstock. Deadstock is leftover material that did not get used for its intended purpose. Maybe too large of an order or was dyed the wrong color. This is unused quality fabric we divert from the landfill by giving it a second chance! In this case, the deadstock of the Circular Memory Jacket is made from polyester and fabric that is typically used for outerwear windbreakers. Mon, Oct 14 2019 10:27 pm EDT Is it machine-washable? We recommend dry clean only as it may have a mixture of materials and truly one of a kind designs. Mon, Oct 14 2019 10:27 pm EDT Can I mail in more than 10 pieces of garment? We suggest ten pieces as big as t-shirts. Mon, Oct 14 2019 10:27 pm EDT What's the shipping cost? For pledges in the US and Canada there is no shipping cost to deliver your “memory items”.

Thu, Nov 19 2020 11:27 am EST Would the Qi receiver damage my phone? You don’t need to worry about this.

Additionally, all backers will receive a survey at the end of the campaign and at that time you can add additional pledges for additional awards. Wed, Mar 11 2020 5:30 pm EDT Can I upgrade my pledge?

Additionally, you can go to a hardware store and buy a piece of a thin metal sheet that you can screw to a wall in your house and create your own Makeway space. Wed, Mar 11 2020 5:33 pm EDT Will it work with magnetic / metallic painted wall? Unfortunately, in our testing, magnetic paint has not shown to be strong enough to hold the tracks. Sorry about that.

Wed, Apr 15 2020 4:52 pm EDT What materials are the Makeway pieces made of? All the parts are made of high quality injected ABS plastic. The marbles are standard glass marbles. (Don’t worry, we've dropped many glass marbles from really high distances. They don’t break). Thu, Mar 12 2020 6:34 am EDT Why aren't you offering stretch goals? We thought about it but we worked really hard, for several years, to bring Makeway to life and we did everything we can to offer as many parts as possible, each part going through a long stage of R&D with hundreds of prototypes along the way, finally reaching a product we are confident we can deliver on. Offering stretch goals would, in our view, take the focus off the product and result in compromise of the quality of the product which is definitely something we want to avoid. Wed, Mar 11 2020 6:21 pm EDT Would it be possible to buy different tricks solely? Yes.

After you back our campaign all backers will get a survey upon the completion of the campaign, that's when you can tell us which edition you prefer.

We prefer glass marbles so that there is no magnetic interference while the marble is rolling, but in certain stages of our R&D we used metal marbles and though they acted slightly differently than expected, they are very cool to use!

Here is a video for reference: https://youtu.be/Ak8SWlMeIoo *How should I calculate the pledge amount correctly?* The pledge amount should include both the product price and shipping cost. Product price of each version of K8 can be found at the rewards section. The shipping cost should be times to the amount of keyboards you have backed. For example, price of 2 x keyboard is $120, shipping cost is $20, here is the math if you need 3 x keyboards: ($60 x 3) + ($10 x 3) = $210, and PM us what you want, otherwise, we don’t know this. Tue, Jun 2 2020 9:43 am EDT Which version can alter/change switch or Hot-swappable? The K8 Hot-swappable version is compatible with almost all the MX style mechanical switches on the market in 3pin and 5pin (including Gateron, Cherry, Kailh, etc.). With SMD-LED compatible switches which are best to show the lighting. And its plate mounted stabilizers. The K8 Optical switch version is also hot-swappable and is compatible with a selection of Optical switches. We are planning to increase its compatibility by releasing 3 more variants later this year. Mon, Jun 8 2020 12:35 am EDT Compatibility between Hot-swappable version and Optical switch version. K8 Optical switch version is compatible with a selection of Optical switches, but not compatible with Gateron Mechanical switch and other MX style Mechanical switch. K8 Hot-swappable version is compatible with Gateron Mechanical switch and other MX style Mechanical switch, but not compatible with Optical switches. Tue, Jun 2 2020 10:37 am EDT Can I use the K4 or K6 Optical switch on the K8? The Keychron Optical switch is hot-swappable and is compatible with a selection of Optical switches (need the same dimension), including the Optical switch on K6 and K4. We are planning to increase its compatibility by releasing 3 more variants later this year. But pls note that the Optical switch on K6 and K4 does not compatible with the K8 Optical switch keyboard Tue, Jun 2 2020 10:37 am EDT Shipping schedule We expect to start shipping in July (finish shipping in August) according to the product model as our supplier produces every batch of the keyboard according to the product model. For orders without any address problem, we will place orders to our shipping company by bulk with a certain method, like product model, country, order number, etc. Frankly, it will be hard to place orders by bulk only according to the order number, as it will be very slow in the process. In terms of the same product model, I won’t say backer #6000 will receive the keyboard earlier than #10 for example. However, backer #100 and #1000 won’t have a big difference in terms of shipping schedule. The time of delivery from Hong Kong to your address depends on local delivery and customs clearance, which we cannot fully control. Tue, Jun 2 2020 10:38 am EDT VAT or import tax included? Due to the customs policy of different countries, we CANNOT guarantee if there is a tax for you. Our product price does not include VAT or import tax of your country. But we’ll try our best to declare a comparatively reasonable value for the product. From our previous experience, the following countries/regions haven’t been charged for import tax including the U.S, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and other EU countries (except remote area) such as Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom For Canada, we\'ll ship through DHL Express only, the ETA is around 7 business days after we ship. There is a chance you might be taxed, but the chance of getting taxed is very low right now, it\'s less than 20%. Please be aware of that. Tue, Jun 2 2020 10:38 am EDT Remote area and US territory shipping cost. Puerto Rico, Guam, Rhode Island, Hawaii, Alaska, US Virgin Islands are required to pay $35 additional cost as per the quote from DHL (we\'ll email you to collect payment once we received your Shipping Form). Shipping cost does NOT include extra costs defined as remote area shipping fees on DHL’s website.

Tue, Jun 2 2020 10:38 am EDT Material of the K8 frame and keycaps? White backlight and RGB version: Both frame and keycap are ABS. Aluminum version: Aluminum front panel, ABS on bottom frame and keycap. Tue, Jun 2 2020 12:18 pm EDT Will the RGB or key position be programmable, remap, changeable, customizable or open source? RGB light: Not customizable, programmable and we don’t have a plan to release SDK, however, there are 15+ types of different RGB backlight including static white backlight, and you can also adjust the speed and direction of each RGB type. Key position: We suggest remap keys with Karabiner for Mac, or Sharpkeys for Windows. We’re working on our Keychron software so users can remap key positions and backlit on their Keychron keyboard. Our goal is to launch it by the end of this year for both Mac and Windows OS. However, its our first ever software, I think we’ll encounter some bugs or issues that need to be resolved, and we prefer a stable progress. Tue, Jun 2 2020 12:18 pm EDT Other keycap legend layout for a specific language or area? E.g. Nordic, Spanish, ISO Until now we have tried our best to satisfied other non-US clients and make it step by step, the future plan of this year as below: Tue, Jun 2 2020 12:18 pm EDT Is the K8 made for gaming? K8 has a latency of 30ms and 13ms on wireless and wired connection, respectively. However, we don’t have dedicated software for key setting and light setting such as lighting for WASD. It may not meet the needs of professional gamers. Tue, Jun 2 2020 12:24 pm EDT Do you offer other layouts besides TKL%? Our K1 offers tenkeyless and full size layout. K2 offers 75% (84-key) layout. K4 has 96% (100-key) layout. K6 has 65% layout >>> https://www.keychron.com Tue, Jun 2 2020 12:24 pm EDT Buy extra keycap set and palm rest. We’ll offer them when the time we send Shipping Form for you to fill in address and switch preference around two weeks after campaign ends. Tue, Jun 2 2020 12:24 pm EDT Choose between Mac and Windows keycaps layout? The keycaps for both Mac and Windows layout are included in the box. You will just need to pick the right keycaps from the box and install them on the keyboard and also remember to switch to the right system toggle.

Tue, Jun 2 2020 12:24 pm EDT Declare value As the current selling price on Kickstarter is a discounted price, we can declare it according to the EX factory price + shipping which will be around $40. But of course, there are lots of extra costs other than Ex-factory price + shipping costs, such as ads and an administration fee of Kickstarter and credit card company, hope you can understand. Tue, Jun 2 2020 12:24 pm EDT Can you declare the parcel as a gift? No, we are sorry that the courier service does not accept this kind of declaration. Tue, Jun 2 2020 12:24 pm EDT Do I need a palm rest for the K8? The K8 has 2 adjustable angled rubber feet, and the K8 will be more ergonomic to type on even without a palm rest. We’ll sell the palm rest (Walnut Wood) add-on after the campaign finished, you can buy it at your discretion. Please make sure you buy with exactly the same email as Kickstarter, so that we could ship it together with the keyboard. Otherwise, we can’t ship it. Tue, Jun 2 2020 12:24 pm EDT Why don’t you put Windows and Mac legends in the same keycap? There was a negative response when we tried that the previous campaign, that’s why we stick with the current design. Some of the users may never use another system, so it is not necessary to print them in the same keycaps. And we also offer extra Mac and Windows keycaps, you can simply swap them based on your needs. Tue, Jun 2 2020 12:24 pm EDT How does the keyboard, switch manage spills, waterproof, splashproof? Optical switch has a better splashproof capability comparatively, but the charging port is NOT splashproof which is same as other type c charging devices. Tue, Jun 2 2020 12:24 pm EDT What’s the sound like for Optical Red, Blue, Brown? The sound of optical switch is pretty much similar to Gateron mechanical switch, you can check this video for the switch sound comparison: https://youtu.be/piOYCaaSM7o Tue, Jun 2 2020 12:24 pm EDT What is the differences between Optical switch and Gateron mechanical switch？ 2. As the Optical switch is not using physical attachment for key strike, it is twice the durability than competing switches for up to 100 million keystrokes. Tue, Jun 2 2020 12:24 pm EDT Will you have other color option for Optical switch? Green or White etc. The Keychron Optical switch version is compatible with a selection of Optical switches. We are planning to increase its compatibility by releasing 3 more variants later this year. Tue, Jun 2 2020 12:24 pm EDT Will you have other keycaps? Like the PBT or double shot keycap It won\'t be available when we start shipping the K8 in July. We’ll announce the schedule once we’re ready. Tue, Jun 2 2020 12:24 pm EDT Will you offer Yellow switch? We don’t have plans to offer the yellow switch for the launch mostly because we already have 27 SKUs for the K8. Adding more switches means more SKUs, it will add more trouble for the manufacture and shipping. BTW, you can buy the hot-swappable version K8 and swap it with yellow switch yourself. Tue, Jun 2 2020 12:24 pm EDT Can I buy the hot-swappable switch, PCB or frame case separately? No, we don’t have a plan to sell these components separately. It’s because we already have 27 SKUs for the K8. Adding more switches means more SKUs, it will add more trouble for the manufacture and shipping. Tue, Jun 2 2020 12:24 pm EDT Can I choose two or more Gateron switch options in the hot-swappable keyboard? No, as it’ll mess up the production, pick and pack easily, while you can easily buy another switch on the market. Tue, Jun 2 2020 12:24 pm EDT K8 code name Tue, Jun 2 2020 12:24 pm EDT What switch stabilizer do you use? Plate mounted stabilizer, you can only swap out unless you open the keyboard. And not compatible with PCB mounted stabilizer. Mon, Jun 15 2020 9:42 pm EDT ?  ']"

341,2841,"[' Does the Green Box Garden include the dirt? Yes! Except it\'s not plain old dirt. It\'s Miracle Grow premium potting mix. The potting mix is already in the container, as it comes fully assembled. All you need to do is remove the protective top and the stickers that cover the vent holes. And viola! Your container is ready for seeds or transplants. No need to drive to the hardware store or garden center to buy dirt. The potting mix is actually the key to getting the water to move up from the reservoir to the plant\'s roots. The potting mix in the Green Box Garden acts like a wick (or a straw) for the water, as it is lighter and more absorbent than dirt. It also promotes more vigorous root growth. Normal garden soil used in a container would basically turn to concrete. And in a self-watering container, regular dirt would not transport the water upwards to the roots. Wed, May 6 2020 11:35 pm EDT How big is the reservoir? The reservoir at the bottom of the container holds 32 fluid ounces. That is about half of a 2 liter bottle. The size of the reservoir was carefully chosen, in order to balance the water-to-potting mix ratio. If the water reservoir is too big compared to the size of the container, there\'s not enough potting mix to provide adequate room for the plant\'s roots to grow. And the container would be too heavy to move; it would no longer be portable. On the other hand, if the water reservoir is too small in comparison to the container, it would need to be filled far more often. The Green Box Garden has a potting mix-to-water ratio of 6 to 1. Meaning there is 6 times the volume of potting mix compared to the amount of water held in reserve. This is the ideal ratio for providing balance and promoting healthy plant growth. Wed, May 6 2020 11:43 pm EDT How often will I need to water the plant? Never! OK, that\'s sort of a misleading answer. With the Green Box Garden you fill the reservoir, and the plant waters itself by drawing water up through the potting mix via the natural capillary action of the potting mix. Disclaimer: When starting plants from SEEDS, you will need to moisten the soil near the top, in order to promote seed germination. But once the plant is established, its roots will draw water up from the reservoir, and you won\'t need to water from the top anymore. Thu, May 7 2020 12:19 am EDT OK, then...How often will I need to fill the water reservoir? That depends on many things. The size of the plant. The type of plant. The temperature and amount of sun the plant is exposed to. In general, the water reservoir of the Green Box Garden only needs to be refilled every 5 to 14 days. In some test cases, quick-growing plants such as radishes were grown from seed to harvest needing only ONE refill of the water reservoir. In another test, a green bean plant (bush variety) was able to go 3 weeks between refills before the leaves started showing signs of stress. However, these were extreme tests conducted during the research phase of the Green Box Garden, and are not necessarily typical. Water-loving plants such as tomatoes and cucumbers usually need a refill every 7 days. Plants such as roses that thrive in slightly drier soil every 15 to 20 days. Obviously if the plant is exposed to the hot, dry days of summer, you may need to refill the reservoir more often. Thu, May 7 2020 12:20 am EDT How is the Green Box Garden better than regular plant containers? Let us count the ways! 1) The Green Box Garden is fully assembled and ready to grow...right out of the box. No other plant container is like that. Visit your local hardware store or garden supply center and you will find hundreds of plant containers of various shapes, sizes, and materials. Do they have premium potting mix included? Do they have a built-in handle for portability? Are they made of FDA approved food-grade material (which is a must for growing edible plants)? Are they sturdy enough to be used over and over for years to come? Are they self-watering? 2) The Green Box Garden uses less water, and requires less frequent watering. By eliminating water loss due to evaporation and seeping into the ground, the Green Box Garden uses up to 75% less water. All the water you put into the reservoir ends up being used by the plant! A flower or vegetable that is planted in a regular old planting pot from the hardware store will need to be watered every day...sometimes multiple times per day if it\'s located in a hot, dry location such as a deck or patio! That\'s because most of the water drains out the bottom or evaporates from the top. In contrast, the Green Box Garden water reservoir holds several day\'s worth of water (in many cases, over a week\'s worth of water). 3) Portability. The Green Box Garden has a sturdy metal handle. And for plants that have grown too tall to use the metal handle, the Green Box Garden can be moved and carried via the handle lip around the top of the container. You may need to move your plants to give them better sunlight. Or protect them from inclement weather. Or to clean your deck. Or perhaps you have a plant that can be outside in the summer, and inside the house in the fall and winter. The Green Box Garden allows you to move your plants wherever you want them to be, quickly and easily! 4) Less problems with insects, weeds, mold, mildew, and fungus. Traditional plant containers that are watered from the TOP attract all of these nasty problems. That\'s because with a regular plant container, you are constantly adding water to the top layer of soil. This becomes a breeding ground for weeds, mildew, and insects. With the Green Box Garden, the top layer of potting mix stays much drier, because the plant is watered from BELOW. This difference vastly reduces problems with insects and harmful organisms, and promotes much healthier plant growth. Thu, May 7 2020 12:33 am EDT Couldn\'t I just make my own? The container looks pretty simple. One of the taglines we use for the Green Box Garden is ""Simple Idea - BIG Results."" So yes, it is a simple idea. The parts & pieces, and how they all fit together is not complicated. But up until now, no one else had put it all together in a complete package. Which is why the Green Box Garden design was given a United States patent, and then introduced via Kickstarter. The sticky note is also a very simple idea...a little piece of paper with some glue on the back. But the way it was put together and used was revolutionary, and changed the way people wrote notes! There are many YouTube videos that show people different ways to assemble your own raised garden bed, irrigation system, and even various types of self-watering containers. If you are looking for a fun project to work on, we encourage you to try some of them. But most will be expensive and time-consuming, both to build and to maintain. And the results will probably be less than what you hope for. I know, because I have tried many of them myself. Which is why I created the Green Box Garden. If you are looking for a new type of self-watering container that is 100% ready to grow, and can go from box to garden in minutes, then the Green Box Garden might be what you are looking for.

346,2846,"[' Why the wide range of pricing in the mascara world? Mascara (and cosmetics in general) are marketed and categorized into various segments:  MASS - which are lower-end and priced products available at grocery or drug stores.  PRESTIGE - which are higher-end and priced products available in department stores and boutique shops (such as Ulta, Sephora).  LUXURY - which are the ultra, designer-esq products found in higher-end department stores (such as SAKS, Bergdorf, etc.)  Lash Duet is a PRESTIGE caliber product with an exclamation point, as it doubles the expense of production because of its 2 brushes, 2 wands, expanded chamber, double ""goop"", etc.  Even with all of this extra - we are determined to make Lash Duet affordable within the Prestige category. Tue, Nov 5 2019 8:15 am EST Someone asked what makes LASH DUET different from Sephora\'s 2-brush applicator. Thanks for asking!  Lash Duet is different because it uses reverse-tweezer technology as opposed to Sephora\'s regular tweezer motion.  This means that the resting position of the brushes is CLOSED - not open like a regular tweezer.  That gives you a much more controlled, ergonomic, intuitive interaction with the applicator because you don\'t have to try and hold the wand/brushes together while you\'re applying mascara.  BIG DIFFERENCE!  Also, Lash Duet has dual ""wipers"" so that both brushes get ""squeegeed"" off as they exit the container.  This is also very important to the application process because mascara goop doesn\'t build up on the inner brushes.  The reverse tweezer motion and dual wipers are both patented by Lash Duet. Wed, Nov 6 2019 2:12 pm EST Someone asked if Lash Duet is just an applicator, or will it come as a complete mascara product. Thanks for asking this because it\'s important to know.  YES - Lash Duet is a complete mascara product with the applicator and ""goop"", just like other mascara you would purchase.  Lash Duet Mascara is disposable, like other mascaras.  I will say, however, that in our product testing, the ""goop"" lasts longer than regular 1-brush mascara product, as it typically only takes 1 ""dip"" into the goop per application.

Above all, both of the cable supports two-way magnetic connection. 1/ Simplelink supports USB-C standard while Simplelink+ supports both USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 standard. 2/ Simplelink supports: 10Gbps data transfer/4K HDMI out/60W Charging in performance, while Simplelink+ gets: 40Gbps data transfer/5K or Dual 4K HDMI out/100W Charging. 3/ Simplelink connects via HDMI and USB-C port, whilt Simplelink+ connects via USB-C port. 4/ Simplelink is available in 0.8m/1.5m cable length, while Simplelink+ gets 2/3m. 5/ Simplelink has 20-pin magnetic tips while Simplelink+ is 24-pin. Mon, May 4 2020 10:08 pm EDT Why Simplelink does not get long cable(2/3m) option? The original Simplelink requires much more effort to test the long cable option. For a long time we did try to get to 2m, but the results showed that it just couldn't get to the speed and stability that we required in the first place. We don't sell things untested or unstable. The Simplelink+ with Thunderbolt 3 standard got everything tested with all boxes ticked, while getting ideal thermal/speed stats, that's why we gets it available until now. Mon, May 4 2020 10:08 pm EDT Do I need Simplelink+? If you mostly use the cable for your mobile devices and smaller ultrabooks, or want to stream the HDMI to one monitor, then the Simplelink is more than enough to suit your needs. If you connect your cable between bigger-sized(15''+) ultrabooks and Ultra HD monitor/dual monitors, they usually requires bigger power consumption and higher performance threshold, then we recommend you the Simplelink+. If you need long cable like 2 or 3 meters, the Simplelink+ is also the one that we can offer now. It can endure longer distance data and power transferring.

Frankly, I think Sherman deserves his own Kickstarter, but if we make it to 3000€ it would buy me enough time to rush it.

When a child completes an activity, a message is sent to their parent for approval. The parent has the opportunity to approve activities as well as send messages of encouragement (or to call them out on them 'cheating' the system). In our user testing sessions, the messaging was such a big hit that we prioritized adding in a closed-loop messaging component that would allow for parent set up and monitored messaging between siblings and friends.

But, kids are already on devices and meeting them where they love to be and play is sometimes the first step to get into their world. We know that technology is here to stay so our intention is to help them develop good habits and allow them to transition between the virtual and real world. By encouraging them to explore some good 'old school' play, kids can discover some of the simpler ways to entertain themselves that give them choices outside of their devices. Sat, May 25 2019 10:16 pm EDT How can we help get KIDICTED™ launched? Thank you so much for supporting our campaign. The more awareness we can build around KIDICTED™, the more successful this campaign and our launch will be.

We don't like them, our kids don't like them and we won't have them in our app. On the flip side, KIDICTED™ will need to be a pay per download app, that will help fund the development to date and fund future development. Parents will have the ability to purchase add-on activity pack to extent their kids play or to celebrate a special theme. These purchases will be offered through direct marketing or by exploring new content in the app. There is a possibility that we may use alerts to notify parents that new content is available but we will always strive to make the experience as unobtrusive as possible. Our goal is to have the app 100% kid friendly and we are following COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) guidelines as well as Canadian Media guidelines. Once we launch, we look to apply for certification as well, Sat, May 25 2019 10:16 pm EDT Can I gift my copy of KIDICTED? Yes! If you don't have kids yourself or yours are all grown and you want to support us building a #techbalancedlife, you can definitely have your copy shared with someone who would love to play.

This measurement is the width of the hand. The single strap and slidable loop mechanism allows GripBeats® to be adjusted to practically any sized hand and still allows full access to all the sensors. The length of the wrist strap section (where it connects at the wrist like a watch) is 26cm / 10""). If these dimensions aren\'t on your range, please contact us and we should be able to make a slight adjustment. These are the latest measurements. :) Thu, Nov 21 2019 8:04 pm EST USING TWO GRIPBEATS® AT ONCE ?? When using GripBeats®as a duo, both are still independent GripBeats® devices. That being said, by having two devices, one in each hand, the user has access to the exclusive new and creative gestures such as synchronized hand movements and touch for e.g. claps, clicks, rotating in symmetry (or the reverse of!). Of course, by having two devices there\'s inevitably the ability to play two different instruments at once. We made a video about this under the headline, \'Using Two GripBeats® Simultaneously\', under \'GRIPBEATS® Tutorials\' on the Kickstarter Page.

The sounds you create come from these connected devices. Fri, Nov 15 2019 2:52 pm EST CAN I USE GRIPBEATS® WITH HEADPHONES / EARPHONES ?? Yes! Now because GripBeats® connects to the software or app on your phone/device/computer, the sounds that are made come out of this connected device, therefore you can use your audio jack port or Bluetooth connectivity (again!) as you would normally for your ear or headphones.

By using the GripBeats®App sequencer, you can record, loop, save, and overwrite all of the above during both live and rested sessions. A live looping session would be you recording multiple instrument tracks over a repeating number of beats, say four beats to a bar. Another live (general) session allows you to record your music without the loop over however many beats and as long as you want! A rested session means that after you\'ve recorded your music you can go back to it using the navigation controls and make changes to its various sound settings and effects both using GripBeats® and the controls in the GripBeats® themselves. Fri, Nov 15 2019 3:04 pm EST HOW IS GRIPBEATS® A FASHION ACCESSORY ?? Perhaps it\'s not a Rolex or Fitbit but GripBeats®definitely offers its very own resting wearable mode as a standalone bracelet. In Wrist Mode, GripBeats® can either be a complete parallel wrap-around (like wrapping a very long bracelet directly around itself 2-3 times) OR it can be spiraled around the forearm, whichever suits you! Fri, Nov 15 2019 3:31 pm EST CAN I USE GRIPBEATS® AS A MIDI CONTROLLER? Yes! Right now GripBeats® outputs MIDI via Bluetooth which means it can be connected to 100s of apps or DAWs which receive a MIDI input e.g. Ableton or Garageband. Better still, MIDI signals can be mapped to various dials and controls within said application. Take Ableton for example, we\'ve been able to use GripBeats®\' rotation to change the rotation dials and also send stop, play, record commands straight from the GripBeats®device. The GripBeats®App also allows you to change the configuration of your GripBeats® device so that you might want to adjust the sensitivity of different movements or that of the touch sensors. You can assign your own gestures from the list of those provided or user-define your very own (stretch goal $80K). Fri, Nov 15 2019 11:22 pm EST WORLDWIDE FREE SHIPPING AND PREPAID CUSTOMS TAX ?? We will ensure that every GripBeats®order is DDP - Delivery Duty Paid. This means that VAT and customs clearance will be covered on our side. Fri, Nov 15 2019 11:45 pm EST WILL THE GRIPBEATS® APP ENABLE GRIPBEATS®\' FULL POTENTIAL OVER CONTROLS FOR MAKING MUSIC THROUGH MOVEMENT AND TOUCH OR DO I NEED TO CONNECT TO A DAW INSTEAD ?? We built GripBeats® in parallel with the GripBeats® App which means that every feature which we\'ve described is at its best when connected to the GripBeats® App. The GripBeats® App has been made for Apple iOS and is halfway completed for Android already. Other than the GripBeats®App, you might find other apps that can receive a MIDI input, in which case, you can pre-program (within the GripBeats® App) your GripBeats®\'MIDI and gesture outputs to then experiment with on said third-party app. One example might be wanting to trigger one of the instrument sounds of this third-party app by using a squeeze gesture positioned at a 45-degree angle out in front of you which you just preconfigured within the GripBeats® App. Sat, Nov 16 2019 12:55 am EST HOW USER FRIENDLY IS THE GRIPBEATS® APP ?? The user interface for choosing your preconfigurations of motion, touch and MIDI outputs has been made to be visually interactive and accessible from the get-go, regardless what prior knowledge in music theory or engineering you might have. In other words, as a GripBeats®owner, you\'re already defined a musician and all that\'s expected of you is that you now decide on how to use your motion and touch controls to make music! Sat, Nov 16 2019 1:14 am EST I HAVE NO BACKGROUND IN MUSIC BUT THIS LOOKS AMAZING. WILL I UNDERSTAND IT? GripBeats® uses your motion and touch to make music. So in terms of control, you already have a full understanding of how you can control your music through movement, gripping, clicking, tapping and so on. The actual musical sounds, effects and techniques you produce will be accessible from either the \'learning mode\' (a feature of the GripBeats® University in-app platform) or \'free mode\'. The understanding of rhythm, melodies, chords, dynamics, articulation, and other controls will be taught in \'learning mode\' at your own speed. Free Mode allows to put your skills to the test without the tutorials. Sat, Nov 16 2019 1:14 am EST CAN I DISABLE THE VIBRATION MOTOR (OR OTHER COMPONENTS) ?? Yes! We\'ve made sure that users have full access over the sensitivity of their GripBeats®hardware components, whether it\'s the vibration motor, LEDs, pressure or the motion sensors. Turn them off. Turn them up. Add thresholds. Or have them at max. It\'s all up to you. Sat, Nov 16 2019 2:06 pm EST IM PHYSICALLY IMPAIRED CAUSING DIFFICULTY IN MOVING, CAN I STILL USE GRIPBEATS® ?? Something which has raised our attention is the number of people asking if they can use GripBeats® even if they have limited movements in certain joints, arms or fingers and in most cases, it\'s very possible. Imagine looking at an analog clock and you see the marks for seconds around the edges. If you were to point directly at the center of that clock with your thumb pointing up. By then rotating your hand 2 seconds either clockwise or anticlockwise, you would demonstrate movement of about 12 degrees. This range of 10-12 degrees of movement is what we consider the minimum and most comfortable range for most people for being able to control GripBeats®\'sounds and effects. That said, if your hand is steady enough, this range can be reduced even further. In summary, by comparing your physical range of movement to the seconds of an analog clock, you are to calculate how many degrees of potential commands you have control over. Note that some people have an uncontrollable tremor or other subtle involuntary movements. If this is the case, it\'s very easy to expand the range so that perhaps instead of just using 10-12 degrees of movement for each command, you expand the range to as much as 90 degrees. By doing so, you could potentially have up to four individual controls (if you are one of those people who can rotate their hand 360 degrees!). An interactive tutorial will be designed especially to help GripBeats®users understand how to define their own range of movement in the GripBeats® App. Sun, Nov 17 2019 3:00 am EST THE GRIPBEATS® APP IS FREE !! The GripBeats® App is FREE! You get all the sounds and effects plus controls over gestures and all the added features for sharing, recording, post-producing, etc. included! Mon, Nov 18 2019 12:08 am EST WHAT IS THE TRANSMISSION SPEED LIKE ?? The current bluetooth transmission rate of GripBeats®(in total) is 17ms which is practically unnoticeable and fast enough to emulate any musical instrument (33ms is a guideline for noticing transmission delay so we\'re way ahead of that). We will also have the option to plug in your GripBeats®via USB to use as a wired MIDI controller. Thu, Nov 21 2019 1:24 am EST ?  ']"

410,2910,"["" How do I buy more add-on items like more filters and hard case? See this step-by-step guide for desktop/laptop (not mobile): https://drive.google.com/file/d/15jjCWQeqPC7R3aFPTFR5XHdpK_jpoYo4/view?usp=sharing Or just follow the steps on desktop/laptop (not mobile): Example: if your current pledge is $99 for 1 UVMask and you want 10x additional filter pads, manually add $12 to your current $99 pledge, for a total of $111. If you want 10x additional filters and 1x carrying case, the total would be $99+$12+$15= $126 (These amounts will vary depending on your original pledge and desired add-ons.) Tue, Aug 4 2020 3:05 am EDT UV light can be harmful. How can we be sure that the product is safe to use? UVMask is tested by SGS to be completely safe according to UL1598 CRD (dated 2020-6-29), Additional Requirements For Germicidal Equipment; and IEC 62471, Photobiological Safety of Lamps and Lamp Systems (1st edition, dated 2006-07). UVMask has a fully light-sealed design with multiple fail-safe measures so UV light will never leak out from the inner component of sterile-vortex. You can find the official SGS UV safety report certificate here proving UVMask is free of any UV/Bluelight related risk or hazard: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m1muW3ZgI-muWvv7u7q_ArGXD3rBzXhS/view?usp=sharing Mon, Aug 10 2020 6:00 am EDT Would the UV-C LEDs in UVMask generate ozone? Although some types of UV light are capable of generating ozone (O3), a gas that naturally exists in the upper atmosphere, which could be harmful to the respiratory system when it's at a higher concentration (the FDA requires the ozone output of indoor medical devices to be no more than 0.05 ppm), only UV wavelengths of 185 nm or shorter can be used to generate ozone. (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144860902000699) We use 265nm wavelength UV-C LEDs in the UVMask, which reliably generate a very pure and narrow range of UV-C that does not go shorter than 255nm (See our UV-C LED optical properties here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V6i9QuftIBrxrtUKTOMTdcVP3EI5nXvE/view?usp=sharing). UV-C at this narrow pure range has been empirically tested to be incapable of generating ozone. Each UVMask is factory-tested for its UV-C wavelength purity to ensure its high safety standard. Mon, Aug 10 2020 6:00 am EDT Does UVMask come in different sizes? Does it come in a child-friendly size too? You’ll be able to select the sizes in our post-campaign survey on BackerKit, together with your shipping address and add-ons! UVMask will come in 2 different sizes. We call them Type X and Type C. See Update #7 for visuals: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/umsystems/uvmask-inactivate-9999-of-all-pathogens-and-air-pollutants/posts/2912438 The core UVMask (hardshell) will still stay the same. The only size variation is the soft silicone face padding (which is also replaceable and can be purchased as an add-on). To ensure the most efficient filtration, a perfect fit, and better comfort, our R&D team used NIOSH anthropometric data in developing the most optimal silicon sizes for UVMask. In 2003, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducted a nationwide anthropometric survey of 3,997 subjects. Based on the gathered data, five sizes and shapes of heads were developed to represent the possible variations within the adult population. Type X is designed for higher nose bridges and fits large faces — Large, Long/Narrow, and Medium from NIOSH head-forms. While Type S is designed for lower bridge noses and perfectly fits smaller faces — Small and Shorter/Wide head-forms. Thanks to the silicone’s flexibility and shape, these 2 shapes will create an airtight seal, regardless of smaller variations from person to person. Please note children 6 years and older have similar face dimensions as adults with smaller faces/heads shown above. (Note: UVMask is not designed for children younger than 6. Parents may choose UVMask for younger children at their own discretion). You will be able to select the silicone padding size as well as purchasing add-on replacements during the post-campaign survey in a service called BackerKit, along with your add-ons and shipment details. Tue, Aug 4 2020 3:50 pm EDT Will the mask have a fan air system? What about moisture and heat build-up? The added noiseless convection fan forced-air system to create a positive pressure airflow that will reduce CO2 accumulation and increase oxygen level for better breathability and ventilation, as well as minimizing moisture build-up. It will not have any impact on battery life or performance. Wed, Jul 29 2020 7:46 am EDT What is the Guaranteed Delivery and 30-Day Satisfaction Guarantee? Do you offer a warranty? If for any reason, UM Systems does not ship your UVMask to you, we will fully refund your money. If you are not 100% satisfied with your purchase, you have 30 calendar days from the date of delivery to request a refund and return the mask (return shipping costs not included). We also offer a 12-month warranty. Wed, Jul 29 2020 7:46 am EDT When will my payment be processed? Kickstarter will process all card payments on August 14th once the campaign has ended successfully, so until then you will not be charged and you can upgrade your pledge level and add more items! Wed, Jul 29 2020 7:46 am EDT Can I take UVMask on an airplane and through security-check? UVMask is an electronic device with a built-in battery. Like any other electronic device, UVMask will not pass the metal detector, therefore needs to be taken off for scanning. We recommend air travelers to wear a disposal mask during security screening instead. That said, UVMask will be safe to bring on board during flight. Wed, Jul 29 2020 7:45 am EDT How will my voice sound, will I muffle? Is the mask breathable inside? Please see voice demonstration in this video: https://youtu.be/GkHLyBuCsvI UVMask’s uniquely designed internal parts with double air intakes and optimized sound engineering allow for effortless breathability and clear sound while speaking. Mon, Aug 10 2020 4:03 pm EDT What lab certifications does the UVMask have? We have the SGS Lab CE-FFP2 certification. This is according to EU standards and equivalent to the N95. We also have FDA certification for the food-grade silicone for the mask’s inner layer. See current certificates from our supply chain: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_Z1NGHIS7tb7GxfMlPJyqHTpj21shPY2?usp=sharing Please note we are still in the process of conducting further tests, such as NIOSH and EPA. We will share these as soon as we obtain them. Wed, Jul 29 2020 7:45 am EDT How long does it take to charge and how long does it last? Can I charge UVMask on the go? It takes 1.5 hours with fast charging and 2-3 hours with regular 5V charging to completely charge the mask. The full charge will last you a full-day, for 8 hours. This can be extended at any time with a power bank and the included USB-C cable. Mon, Aug 3 2020 9:33 am EDT What is the FFP2 filter used in UVMask, is it a PM2.5 filter? Our filter is not just a PM2.5 filter. PM2.5 is an understatement. UVMask’s filters are CE-FFP2 (EU standard same as N95). This is a much higher standard than PM2.5. PM2.5 filters only block 25-micron particles. FFP2 filters 0.3-micron particulates with an efficiency the same as an N95 mask. That’s an improvement of over 8,300%. See here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_Z1NGHIS7tb7GxfMlPJyqHTpj21shPY2?usp=sharing Wed, Jul 29 2020 7:45 am EDT Can the mask be used effectively when the battery is depleted? The FFP2 filter along will provide the equivalent protection of an N95 - as the name indicates, it will block very small airborne particles as small as 0.3μm like dust, pollen, droplets, tobacco, bushfire smoke, and more. Wed, Jul 29 2020 7:45 am EDT When do I change the filters? How often you change filters depends on how you use your UVMask. See the recommendations below: Wed, Jul 29 2020 7:45 am EDT When will the shipping start and do you offer worldwide and EU-friendly shipping? Shipping will start in late October 2020. We ship worldwide and we use EU-friendly shipping carriers as well. Wed, Jul 29 2020 7:45 am EDT How much will replacement filters cost and where can I buy filters after the campaign? You can get a pack of 10 for $12. This works out at $1.20 per filter. 1/ You can add more filters to your current pledge during the Kickstarter live campaign, see the instructions in the previous questions. 2/ After the Kickstarter is over, you'll be able to buy them from our Indiegogo InDemand campaign that starts Aug 15th 3/ We will also offer them in our post-campaign backer survey and later on our website: https://um.systems You’ll be able to buy a cutting stencil from us as an add-on later in the campaign, allowing you to cut out a compatible filter from any N95 or KN95 masks on the market. Wed, Jul 29 2020 7:45 am EDT What is the double breathing protection? UVMask comes with 2 layers of protection. The advanced filtration system uses CE-FFP2 air filters to purify PM 0.3 particles, including air pollution, dust, and other particles up to 100x smaller than a grain of flour! The patent-pending Sterile-Vortex technology then concentrates the UV-C light's full power on the air you breathe, adding to a higher total filtration efficiency in real-time! Wed, Jul 29 2020 7:45 am EDT What happens to the air I exhale? Exhale air will go through CE-FFP2 (N95) filter. So the air you breathe out is also filtered and purified. You can also get CE-FFP3 (N99) filters for extra protection. Mon, Aug 10 2020 8:37 pm EDT Will the mask fog up my glasses? The air intake and outtake of UVMask were carefully designed to be on the sides, allowing damp air to vent out from the sides without fogging up your glasses. The mask is also comfortable to wear with (sun)glasses, with nose support and over-head straps (or over-ear) design that leaves your ears free. Wed, Jul 29 2020 7:44 am EDT What is the Sterile-Vortex protection and how does it work? The patent-pending Sterile-Vortex technology concentrates UV-C light full power on the air you breathe with an ultra-high filtration efficiency. UV-C light is the safest UV light for humans since it has the least penetrative capabilities through human skin, making it ideal for purification. As glass components reduce UV-C light transmission, your air filter mask’s Sterile-Vortex uses the highest quality quartz optics and high precision chip manufacturing to power each UV-C LED. Wed, Jul 29 2020 7:44 am EDT What’s the technology used inside UVMask? UVMask uses two state-of-the-art Ultra-High Intensity UV-C LEDs: 265nm 25,000µW/cm² (25mW/cm²), total 50mW/cm². The sapphire optics for the LEDs ensure the highest efficiency. Regular glass blocks 100% UVC, so quartz is the best material to ensure UVC passes through the optics at the highest efficiency. Wed, Jul 29 2020 7:44 am EDT What material is the outer shell is made of? It's made out of food-grade ABS/PC material. Sun, Jul 26 2020 2:59 pm EDT Is there any patented technology? The entire UVMask is patent-pending. No mask currently produced uses UV-C light at a high enough intensity, or for a long enough period of time to effectively purify the air that is breathed. Thanks to our unique patent-pending Sterile-Vortex design, any air you breathe is purified over 10x faster than the rate at which you can breathe it! Sun, Jul 26 2020 2:59 pm EDT How safe is UVMask’s silicone for my skin? It’s FDA-certified food-grade silicone. 100% safe for your skin. Sun, Jul 26 2020 2:59 pm EDT What is the difference between UVMask and other masks on the market? UVMask is the first in the market that not only purifies and filters all the air you inhale but also the air you exhale using its patent-pending UV-C Sterile-Vortex technology and CE-FFP2 filter, it effectively filters all the air you breathe in real-time. Also, no other mask features a powerful enough (or any) UV-C light to purify the air in real-time. UVMask uses two state-of-the-art Ultra-High Intensity UV-C LEDs: 265nm 25,000µW/cm² (25mW/cm²) which filters and purifies the air you breathe in real-time. Mon, Jul 27 2020 5:08 pm EDT How should I clean the mask? Use soft fabric with a medical alcohol spray to clean the surface gently. Sun, Jul 26 2020 2:59 pm EDT Is the UVMask safe to use by adults and children? Yes, absolutely. UVMask is safe for all ages Sun, Jul 26 2020 2:59 pm EDT Does UVMask protect against air pollution, cigarette smoke, and bushfire smoke? Yes. The first layer of protection in the UVMask is a CE-FFP2 air filter that filters PM0.3, PM2.5, and PM10 particles. This includes air smog pollution, cigarette, and bushfire smoke. Mon, Jul 27 2020 5:08 pm EDT Which pledge manager will you be using after the campaign? We'll be using BackerKit to manage our post-campaign fulfillment where you'll be able to select your colors, pay for shipping, choose more add-on options, and manage your shipping address! Sun, Jul 26 2020 2:59 pm EDT How many colors are available and how do I choose one? Jet Black and Jet White. You can choose your color in the post-campaign backer survey that we’ll be sending via email after the campaign ends. Sun, Jul 26 2020 2:59 pm EDT What is the weight and is it comfortable to wear for longer periods of time? ~3 ⅞ oz. (110g). Yes, it is designed to be comfortable even over long periods of time. Sun, Jul 26 2020 2:59 pm EDT What type of charger do I need? Any standard USB charging station (charger not included with UVMask). A standard USB-A to USB-C cable is included. Sun, Jul 26 2020 2:59 pm EDT Is the included battery safe? Yes, we use 2x high-quality 3.7V / 1,800 mAh Li-Po high safety standard Li-Polymer (103450) batteries. They have been tested extensively for safety. The current Li-Polymer battery technology will never explode. Mon, Aug 3 2020 11:04 am EDT Is the battery replaceable? The battery is not replaceable, you need to charge it with the included USB-C cable. It lasts 8 hours on a single charge and you extend that by plugging it into any power bank. Mon, Aug 3 2020 9:33 am EDT Are there any battery level indicators in the UVMask? Sun, Jul 26 2020 2:59 pm EDT Are there any filter change alarms in UVMask? There is no automatic alarm. We recommend you set a reminder on your phone, depending on your typical usage pattern: Sun, Jul 26 2020 2:59 pm EDT How breathable is the mask in CFM (cubic feet per minute)? We use a 12,000 RPM fan for the forced air system, which translates to roughly about 2 CFM or 57L/minute at max output. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT Are the filters designed specifically for UVMask? Yes, they are. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT Can I wash the filter? No. We do not recommend washing the filter. Additional filters can be purchased from us at any time at a reasonably low cost. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT What happens to UV-C light if the mask is damaged? What are the fail-safe measures in UVMask? We have developed the product with your safety in mind. Hence the mask comes with two internal layers of protection. The Sterile-Vortex is 100% sealed off, followed by an inner shell ABS/PC protection layer that blocks 100% of UV-C. These two layers ensure a high level of protection in case of damage. Apart from that, the optics design of UVMask is very specific. The UV-C LEDs point sideways and have very short range focus. So in case, the mask is broken, the UV light will not be directed at the human face, and, hence, will not do any damage. In all cases, you can always refer to your User Manual where along with other helpful information you will see the advice not to turn the mask on, in case of visible damage. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT Is UVMask water-resistant? UVMask is rated IP54 water-resistant. Rain falls at a low pressure, so ratings in the IP54 to IP65 range are enough to keep the filter and interior components safe and dry. These ratings are also enough to stop airborne particulates from damaging the filter and components inside the enclosure. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT How long can I continuously wear the mask? he FFP2 filter will provide the equivalent protection of an N95 - as the name indicates, it will block 95% of airborne particles as small as 0.3μm like dust, droplets, smoke, pollen. Mon, Aug 3 2020 9:33 am EDT How do you change the filters? Open the front shell (it's attached by magnets, so it’s very easy to open). Gently remove the orange frame of the filter, slide out the older filter, and slide in the new filter. Put the orange frame back in place. Close the front shell. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT What’s inside the box of a single UVMask? Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT Will UVMask offer a warranty on Kickstarter perks? Yes! UVMask comes with a 1-year limited warranty. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT Can I use more than 1 filter in a mask? Technically yes, but we do not see any benefit of doing so. UVMask already provides sufficient protection against all pollutants and allergens with a single filter. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT What is the safe upper limit of volumetric flow that UVMask can purify in real-time? 6-10 liters per second (normal human breath is about 0.5 liters per breath) Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT Will it be comfortable to wear the mask during a run? Yes. You can wear the straps both around your ears or behind your neck (recommended for active sports). You can run comfortably with UVMask correctly worn. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT Is UVMask suitable for people with asthma? People with asthma or other related breathing difficulties may require CPAP machines to assist breathing. Please note that UVMask is not an FDA approved CPAP device, therefore we do not recommend patients who require CPAP to use UVMask. That said, if a user does not normally require CPAP machine to assist breathing, UVMask can be used for enhanced breathing filtration and it does come with forced air positive pressure system that helps improve breathability. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT Is it for only personal use or can it be used by several people? Personal use is strongly recommended. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT How long do the UV-C bulbs last and will there be any replacements available? We use two state-of-the-art UV-C LEDs (Made in Japan) in every UVMask which have a minimum lifetime of 10,000 hours. So they will probably last longer than the mask itself, therefore never needing a replacement. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT Can UVMask be worn while charging? Absolutely yes. You can wear it while charging with a power bank for extended hours. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT In case the straps break or become loose, will it be available to buy more, from where, and for how much? Yes, we will offer replacement straps as add-ons and you can purchase after the campaign ends from our website at a low cost. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT Can I add one more masks to my existing pledge? Yes, just add a fixed $89 to your existing pledge for each additional mask. An additional shipping charge of $10 will be added to the post-campaign survey. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT Are the filters treated with any solutions or chemicals? No, we don't treat the filters with any chemicals. These are non VOC filters, 100% safe for breathing. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT How long can the filters be stored? Each filter has a five-year shelf life. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT What are the fail-safe measures in the UVMask? Both batteries and UV-C LCDs are doubled-up for fail-safe backup, on top of the extended power. So if one fails, the other one will still work. We designed our circuit board and MCU power management logic that way to be smart enough to continue operation. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT What are the fail-safe measures so that your UV-C to never hit skin and eyes directly? UV light is a form of light, so it only travels in straight lines. And UV-C light is easily blocked. Standard window glass, according to the International Ultraviolet Association, will block 100% of the UV-C light. (See: https://hps.org/publicinformation/ate/q12082.html) While air flows freely through a spiral-shaped channel, UV-C gets 100% trapped and blocked, only confined in the vortex itself. It is this patent-pending design that allowed us to put high-intensity UV-C light safely in a durable ABS/PC walled vortex shape and protected by a further layer of the inner wall in the mask. Furthermore, both UV-C LEDs in the vortex are also positioned sideways, making the projection angle parallel to the human face as an extra layer of fail-safe measure. So to summarize, UV-C is completely 100% sealed within the vortex chamber and will never leak out and have any skin or eye contact, making it safe and robust. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT Does the mask make a noise and how loud is it? UVMask is designed to operate with quietness in mind. All components we use are tested for noise reduction. Sun, Aug 9 2020 4:31 am EDT What if I have a beard / facial hair? It all depends on the style of facial hair. We recommend following CDC 'Facial Hairstyles and Filtering Facepiece' guidelines, which can be found here: https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/images/infographics/FacialHairWmaskLG.jpg Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT What is the recommended operating temperature and storage temperature? The operation temp is -22°F (-30°C) to 140°F ( 60°C). Storage temperature -20 °F (-5 °C) to +86 °F (+30 °C). Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT Is UVMask regulated by the FDA? UVMask is initially marketed to the general public for non-medical, non-source control purposes, such as personal face-covering/protection for the general public, use in construction, and other industrial applications. Face masks marketed to the general public for general non-medical purposes, such as use in construction and other industrial applications, are not medical devices. These types of face masks that are not intended for medical or surgical use and without medical or surgical types of claims are not regulated by the FDA as medical devices. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT Is UVMask metal detector safe? You will need to take the mask down and pack it for scanning when going through a metal detector. So you'd ideally need a regular surgical mask in the pocket in a situation like a security check. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT How do you solve the problem of coughing and sneezing? With the upcoming addition of the forced air system, coughing and sneezing won’t cause an issue in droplets going inside the vortex. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT Is there a version of your mask without the UV-C component? Yes, and we code name it UM95B. It will be available as an add-on post campaign. It is positioned more as an accessory to the core UVMask. Since it is metal and battery-free, and it shares the same front shell/strap as the core UVMask, you can purchase it for situations where battery/metal is not permitted, such as airport security check; or situations that has less-risk, so the filters alone are sufficient in protecting yourself and others, saving battery life and traveling light. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT Do you sell UVMask on any other Websites other than Kickstarter? No. We DO NOT sell UVMask anywhere else except on Kickstarter. If you notice any other Website that advertises and sells our product illegally, please alert us immediately at hello@um.systems Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT Is UM Systems an EPA approved establishment?

Our shipping carrier, PostNL has advised that all letter-post, parcel-post and EMS items require a signature on delivery and will no longer be signed at the time of delivery. “For these items, the mail carrier will ask the recipient for the last three digits of the recipient’s ID reference number, and this information will be entered by the carrier in the signature field on their handheld device. This temporary measure will be effective until further notice.” We can only guarantee that the shipping from the Netherlands won\'t be affected.

Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:02 am EST What movements are in these new Saturn V watches? We’re offering two different watches in this campaign, each powered by a different Swiss-made premium movement: • Saturn V Moon Lander: The ETA G10.962 EO Chronograph Moonphase quartz Swiss movement • Saturn V Moon Dust: The Sellita SW200-1 26-jewel automatic Swiss movement Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:02 am EST Do these watches have luminescence? Will they be readable at night? Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:02 am EST Why do you keep launching your new collections on Kickstarter? We love Kickstarter for so many reasons, here are some: 1. It strengthens and builds the LIV community. Each campaign encourages our fans to get involved and communicate with us directly. Through our first four Kickstarters, we’ve developed and maintained close relationships with people all over the world, to the extent that it does feel like family at times. Many of our fans have shared their personal stories with us, as we have with them, and that\'s what makes this experience so unique and special to us. 2. It allows us to offer our watches at accessible prices. We have to produce a certain number of timepieces to fill the minimum order quantities required by our suppliers. Kickstarter allows us to pre-sell our new collections, giving us the buying power to grab competitive pricing. This lets us give our fans a significant discount in return. 3. It provides an incredible planning framework. It forces us to explain why the product needs to exist, how it\'s different from its competitors, create a timeline, and many other components that ensure that our production runs smoothly and efficiently. It also allows us to gauge the public\'s interest in a particular product, and plan for new products accordingly. 4. It\'s an updated version of an extended ""launch party.""  It\'s exhausting and filled with adrenaline, but an excellent experience. We wouldn\'t have it any other way. Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:02 am EST How does Kickstarter work? What is Kickstarter? Kickstarter recognized, like LIV, that the process of a small company getting a product funded and to market was nearly impossible. As a result, many really cool products never saw the light of day. Kickstarter saw crowdfunding as a great way to provide access to capital. Crowdfunding works like this: A company or individual puts together a detailed plan for their idea. It has a goal, a timeline, a communication plan to keep backers in the loop, and a distribution process to get the reward (the product) to the people. Think of it like investing in a startup. Kickstarter goes to great lengths to vet each campaign to weed out scams and ideas without any chance of coming to fruition. In our case, this is our fifth trip to the Kickstarter rodeo. It’s a perfect means for us to bring our latest designs to fans, watch freaks, enthusiasts, and people new to LIV. Plus, with the input we receive from our fans, we’re able to add features and enhancements. Not only do backers help get the watch to market, but they can also contribute to future offerings! Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:02 am EST What are my payment options? Are Paypal or checks an option? You can use a debit or credit card associated with Visa, Discover, JCB, MasterCard, or American Express. Kickstarter does not currently accept Maestro or Visa Electron cards. If using a pre-paid credit card, please make sure that the card has a value of at least $1 more than your pledge amount. In order for your pledge to count towards a project\'s funding goal, you must pledge through the project page using a credit card.  You cannot pay via check or cash. While Kickstarter supports most major credit cards, but they do not support payment with Paypal at this time. Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:04 am EST How Do I specify my exact watch/colorway preference? Within a few weeks after the campaign ends, you will receive an email with access to the LIV Rewards Platform where you will input your selections! Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:04 am EST When will the watches from this campaign be shipped? The watches from the campaign are estimated to  start shipping in April 2021. Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:04 am EST Where can I buy your other watches? You’ll have the option to purchase additional watches once you’ve made your pledge. Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:04 am EST How do I know you guys will deliver on what you promise? How can I trust you? This is our FIFTH Kickstarter campaign so we know what we are doing, and we have an EXCELLENT track record and history in providing an amazing quality product at an accessible price! We have thousands of fans all over the world who absolutely love our watches. Our integrity is very important to us, and our goal is to exceed our fans\' expectations, so you can be sure we will deliver on what we promise. The reviews posted about us all over the place online are proof of this. Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:06 am EST How long has your company been around for? After being in the watch industry for 22+ years, we realized that the standard business model used by the big watch companies priced most consumers out of the Swiss-made market. With this “insider” experience, we knew it didn’t have to be this way; that a new business model could make Swiss quality affordable. Enter Kickstarter. At the end of 2014, we launched LIV Watches with the GX1 on Kickstarter; getting fully funded within the first 11 hours! Just over a year later, we brought the GX1-A to life and received over $1.1 million in funding. In March 2017, we launched the Rebel, receiving more than $1.7 million dollars from over 2,900 customers, many of whom had never even heard of us. It remains the most crowdfunded Swiss watch at that time. Not resting on our laurels, we launched our most ambitious campaign to date in 2018 featuring four different new models, offering a whole new level and variety of timepieces: a Diver’s, an Alarm, a Pilot’s, and an Automatic Chronograph. Which brings us to the Saturn V launch. Our fifth launch involving a Saturn V. We see the stars (and Moon) aligning here. Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:06 am EST What is the cost of international shipping? We offer a flat rate of $15 for shipping and insurance to all global backers. Purchase more than one watch, and we provide free shipping. Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:06 am EST Can I request a specific Limited Edition number? As much as we\'d love to, unfortunately, we\'re unable to accommodate requests for specific limited edition numbers for the following reasons: 1. Because multiple people could ask for the same number, and we don\'t want to disappoint any of our fans. 2. Because fulfilling requests for Limited Edition numbers would be a logistical nightmare, trying to match every order to the correct serial number. As you can understand, once we\'re up to the fulfillment process, we want things to go as quickly as possible, so that we can get your watches out to you as fast as possible. Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:06 am EST When can I purchase additional straps? You’ll be able to purchase additional straps and other accessories once you’ve made your pledge. We’ll send you an email with details, so stay tuned for that ;). Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:08 am EST Do these watches come with a warranty? Yes, all LIV watches come with a five-year warranty, including the watches on this campaign! Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:08 am EST Will I be charged duties/customs when I receive my reward? Some countries charge an import duty for purchasing an item from overseas; we wish we had the power to eliminate that tax or charge, but unfortunately, we don\'t :(. We will do everything we can to minimize the amount, but we can\'t guarantee how much you’ll have to pay. Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:08 am EST How can multiple watches be purchased? If you want multiple watches, simply calculate the total amount for all the watches you’d like and then pledge that amount. For example, if you want a Saturn V Moon Lander ($370.00) and a Saturn V Moon Dust ($470.00), add the amounts together ($370.00 + $470.00 = $840.00), that will equal your pledge amount. Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:08 am EST What if I haven\'t received my confirmation message via email? If you have not received your confirmation message after 24 hours of making your pledge, please contact us at info@livwatches.com and we’ll direct you from there :). Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:11 am EST What are the dimensions of the watches? Fri, Nov 6 2020 6:15 pm EST Do the watches have a crystal skeleton back? The Saturn V Moon Dust has a crystal exhibition back through which you can see the precision automatic movement. Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:11 am EST Are straps from your other collections going to fit the watches in this campaign? Yes, our 22 mm straps will fit the Saturn V Moon Dust and our 23 mm straps will fit the Saturn V Moon Lander. Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:11 am EST What is the battery life for the Moon Lander? The Saturn V Moon Lander battery will last a cool 3+ years (38 months by ETA’s calculations) to keep up with your active lifestyle! Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:11 am EST How much do the watches weigh? Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:11 am EST Are the watches returnable? We are confident you’ll love your watch. However, on the off chance that you don’t, we offer a 90-day, no question asked return policy for a 100% store credit.  You can also exchange your watch within 90 days for an item of equal or lesser value. We believe it\'s the right, and the only way to go as a company. The LIV Way.

478,2978,"[' The price seems high, what do I get for this price? Short answer: Quality in comfort, durability and practicality compared to other pillows, in addition to sustainable focus on the environment and worker rights. Also, as we believe quality also comes from motivated and proud seamstresses, and that protecting our environment is essential, we decided to source material locally, and produce the pillow in Norway. This ensures that all part of our product have to follow the most stringent environmental and worker right laws in the world, and we strive to show that quality is an important, and appreciated, attribute of our pillows. The price of the pillow reflects what making these commitments costs. If you have the same beliefs as we do, and want a pillow that works, and lasts for as long as you need it, then this is your pillow. Wed, Jul 15 2020 11:42 am EDT Is this pillow mostly for women? No. When I started out, I made this pillow to support me when I was pregnant, and when I was breastfeeding. But we have had this pillow in my inner circle of friends for the last four years, and there are just as many men as women that use it. My husband was the first to permanently ""borrow"" my pillow! This is actually the reason we have a reward with to pillows, and any person with a spouse or girl-/boyfriend need to get two, to avoid the ensuing arguments that follow having to share one. Wed, Jul 15 2020 11:33 am EDT What is unique about this pillow? Unlike existing triangle pillows, our Trangel pillow has foam normally used in out-door pillows in off-shore vessels out in the North Sea. The foam is made to breath well and keep its form during hard daily use. This makes the pillows last a lot longer, even under these extreme conditions. In addition, also unlike other pillows you can find in the market, our Trangel pillow has an inner protective cover, normally used to protect baby-mattresses. This is also a highly ventilating fabric, letting humidity escape easily, and prolonging the lifetime of the foam. The outer cover follow traditional Scandinavian aesthetic design, stylish and quality finish, with simple practical details like a handle to carry around, and pockets in our custom version. Together with our Scandinavian focus on environment and workers rights, our Trangel pillow is highly unique, both in sustainable production, form, quality, practicality and comfort.
