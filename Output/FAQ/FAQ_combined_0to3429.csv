It was started by Charlie Greenman(https://linkedin.com/in/charliegreenman/). Right now the firm isn't too large, and employs about 4-5 part timers. Collectively, we have experience working for Fortune 500 companies, such as Goldman Sachs, Verizon, and Merrill Corporation. We have one product on the way, as well as one book.

STL is used primarly for 3D printing. Tue, Feb 14 2017 5:09 am EST How does it work? You are given a 3D workspace, a cursor, and a palette.  You can move the cursor within the 3D workspace.  To place a block you move the cursor where you want it, and press space.  Press delete to remove.  The palette lets you pick what shape, color and texture you want to put down. Tue, Feb 14 2017 5:17 am EST How does it compare with existing 3D Modellers? The main problem is converting an idea in your head into a visual 3D representation.  The tools vary from low cost applications like Blender, to high end systems like 3D Studio, Maya, and others.  All of them require a fair amount of skill to use.  Block Modeller is low cost, and easy to use.  Playing with toy bricks easy. Tue, Feb 14 2017 5:20 am EST ?  ']",3

77,2056556137,"["" How many stories will the book have? Our current plan is for 18 stories of no more than 7,000 words. That's 126,000 words, so the size of a fairly hefty novel. Of that we hope that at least 6 stories will come from Bristol writers and at least 6 from Caribbean writers. As we are having open submissions, we hope the remaining stories will come from all over the world. We haven't specifically promised this in the project description because plans rarely survive contact with reality. We might get sent a really good 10,000 word story, or some great flash fiction. And finance-wise it is always hard to know what you'll be able to afford as different rewards have different costs so you don't know how much money you'll end up with. But it is what we are aiming for, and hopefully we'll get there. Mon, Oct 31 2016 1:06 pm EDT Where will the money go? By far the largest chunk of expenses in the budget is paying the authors. We plan to pay professional rates, which are 6c per word. You can do the math. After that he biggest bill will probably be printing the paper copies of the book, followed by Kickstarter fees. We also need to pay for a cover, and there are various other people who will be working on the book who need to be paid - Roz and Jo, for example. Cheryl does not get any money until the book makes a profit, which isn't going to happen as a result of the crowdfunding alone unless we go well over the base target. Mon, Oct 31 2016 1:20 pm EDT What is the deadline for submissions? Steady on, tiger, we haven't funded yet. Assuming we do fund, we'll have a planning meeting and set out the calendar for the production process. As we said above, we'd like to have the book ready for Worldcon in Helsinki. We'll open submissions once we have that all sorted. Mon, Oct 31 2016 1:20 pm EDT Aren't pirates awful people? Yes, most of them were. Privateers - men like Drake, Grenville and Woodes Rogers in his early career - were pretty nasty too, especially if you happened to be a Spanish treasure galleon.

We’re not at liberty to discuss this, but I think it has to do with a late-night ouija session and a message from the future :D Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT What platforms is Antstream available on? At launch, the Antstream application will be available on Mac, PC, Xbox One, Android tablet and mobile devices, Nvidia Shield, and Amazon Fire Stick, with other platforms becoming available later, including PS4 and Nintendo Switch. Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT What games do you have on Antstream? Please see https://www.antstream.com/gameslist for our list of currently available games. Remember, these are just the games we have announced, we have many more in the pipeline and are constantly having conversations to expand our game list, so watch this space! Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT Why don't you have game X? I want to play it! Although we have a vast catalogue of licensed games, there will always be a few games that we haven't yet licensed. If there are games you'd particularly like to see on the platform, please let us know in the comments, on Facebook or Twitter, or on our Discord server and we'll see what we can do! Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT Can I add my games to Antstream? If you have the licence to a classic game or a catalogue of titles, we have a pledge amount perfect for you that will allow you to add your games to the platform! Please see the Homebrewer pledge amount for more details. Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT How does Antstream work? Antstream Arcade is an app that gives you instant access to a vast catalogue of games. Once you have our app there is nothing further to download. All the games are streamed directly to your devices including your mobiles, tablets and PC’s of almost any spec. Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT Why ‘stream’ games when you can transfer the entire ROM due to them being so small? As we roll forward to support newer games, the size of the games increase. We wanted to create a consistent experience regardless of whether the game is 48k or 480mb. Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT Are you emulating? Yes. Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT How do you stream it? Antstream technology enables us to run the games in the cloud and stream the display directly to your devices in real-time. It is like using an ultra fast remote PC connection. Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT How do you play games on Antstream? You can play Antstream Arcade on almost any device. All games on Antstream have been custom configured by our retro experts to be playable with keyboard, gamepad and touch screen interfaces. We recommend using a Microsoft Xbox One style gamepad for the best experience. Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT Where is Antstream available? Antstream will be global, but we will initially start rolling out the service in Western Europe and the US.  Please follow us on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter for the latest news on new territories being added to the service. Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT What are Antstream Challenges? We have created exclusive multiplayer challenges for the most popular games on Antstream. These original challenges enable you to compete against your friends and the global Antstream community. For more information please see here - https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/234135283/antstream-retro-gaming-reborn/posts/2482657 Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT What type of internet connection do I need for Antstream? Antstream will work on a very good 4G connection, but WiFi / wired Ethernet provide the best experience.  Due to the unique way this service works, playing games over a mobile network may not currently give the best experience.  Also, as with other streaming services like Netflix, it will use larger amounts of data than some other gaming apps. Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT Will your games be instant loading or will we get the joys of loading screens and music on old systems like the C64? Antstream will be instant loading, but if there is enough demand for it, we will look to add the option for the full loading sequence at a future point, as we do recognise that was an integral part of the original experience, and it'd be a shame to miss out on all those great chip tunes. Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT Do you have any examples of Antstream in action? Our most recent outing can be found at twitch.tv/gamedigital at 11 hours and 15 minutes where we had a retro hour as part of Gameblast 19. We played Double Dragon, Speed Ball 2 and Treasure Island Dizzy. We had a great response and it really shows off some of Antstream’s features, as well as how smooth the streaming is. Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT For those of us whose pledges include a subscription, when will the subscription start from? Will it start from the official launch date in late 2019, or will the subscription start during the beta stage? Your subscription will start when Antstream goes fully live later this year. Consider the early access as a BETA where you get to experience Antstream and feedback to the team without it affecting your subscription. Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT ?  ""]",16

If for whatever reason you are unwilling or unable to pledge on the Kickstarter site, then you can email me at jik@kamens.us and tell me how much you would like to pledge, and then if they campaign succeeds I will arrange payment with you separately and give you the reward corresponding to your pledge amount. However, please think twice before doing this, because such a pledge will not count toward the campaign total on Kickstarter, and I will not be able to proceed with porting my add-ons to Thunderbird 78 unless the campaign on Kickstarter hits its goal. If you would like to pledge via Kickstarter but you are running into technical difficulties, then you can click on ""Help Center"" at the bottom of the page and then ""Contact us"" in the upper right corner to open a support ticket with Kickstarter. Fri, Jan 24 2020 12:36 pm EST Will I have to buy a separate license for each computer or Thunderbird profile I use? Add-on licenses will be per-user, not per-computer or per-profile, so you will be able to use your license on multiple profiles and computers WITHIN REASON. Please be kind and don\'t cheat by sharing licenses among users. Remember that if I am not taking in enough license revenue, then maintaining the add-ons will not be sustainable and I\'ll have to stop, so please play fair. Thu, Jan 23 2020 7:58 pm EST If I\'m a previous donor to your add-ons, do I have to donate again to the Kickstarter to get a discounted license? Previous donors to my add-ons get a separate, special deal! I\'ve emailed most of my previous supporters already, but some have changed email addresses since they donated, and I might have missed a few. If you\'ve donated in the past and didn\'t receive an email from me, and you can give me the means to verify your previous donation (e.g., whether you donated through Paypal or some other way, what email address you used, perhaps you even still have the receipt that Paypal sent you), email me at jik@kamens.us and we\'ll work it out. Having said all that, if it\'s important to you for one or more of my add-ons to remain available past Thunderbird 78, then you should consider pledging to the Kickstarter even if you previously donated, because if the Kickstarter doesn\'t succeed I\'m not going to be able to do the work to port the the add-ons. Note that the previous-donor and Kickstarter deals ""stack,"" so you\'ll still come out ahead. Thu, Jan 23 2020 7:58 pm EST Are your add-ons going to remain open-source? TL;DR I am not sure it will be feasible for the add-ons to remain open-source, but if it is then they will. I have been maintaining add-ons for nearly a decade, and in that time, less than 2% of the people using them have contributed to support them. Given the extent and frequency of recent Thunderbird changes necessitating significant updates to add-ons, that level of financial support is no longer sustainable for me. I tried to solve that, before launching this campaign, by finding volunteers to help with maintaining the add-ons, but none stepped forward. I even offered to give someone all of the contributions received for the add-ons for the next year, and 50% for five years after that, and still, no one was willing to do it. I\'ve therefore reluctantly concluded that the only way I can sustain continuing to maintain the add-ons is if I can guarantee significantly higher recurring revenue than the voluntary contributions. That is why I am using a Kickstarter campaign: the campaign will not succeed unless enough people commit, and it\'s that commitment that I need to be able to continue. If I keep the add-ons open-source after doing the work to port them to Thunderbird 78, then anyone will be able to take the source code, remove the licensing code, and repost them as different add-ons on addons.thunderbird.net, undercutting what I am trying to do here and bringing us back to it being impossible for me to sustain continuing to maintain them. Even now, when this Kickstarter campaign has hundreds of backers and thousands of dollars pledged, if a qualified person stepped forward and volunteered to take over maintenance and port the add-ons to Thunderbird 78, I would cancel the campaign and keep the add-ons free and open source. My goal here isn\'t to rake in cash, it\'s to make it possible for the add-ons to continue to exist, and I have a strong preference for open source when it is viable. But it isn\'t viable if no one is willing and able to keep maintaining the add-ons for free. One caveat: if the Kickstarter campaign succeeds, then I will look into the possibility of making the code open-source under copyright terms which prevents it from being used to compete with the licensed add-ons. I would love to do that if it turns out to be possible. However, I am not sure it will be, because I fear I will end up spending the time and money that was supposed to be spent maintaining the add-ons instead on lawyers suing people violating the copyright.

Thu, Jan 10 2019 3:26 am EST Why is the shipping more expensive than your past kickstarters? Unlike my past Kickstarter campaigns, this campaign includes items of apparel such as the tote bags and socks! These are larger items and require larger packaging. The Royal Mail prices are based on the size and weight of packages, so the shipping costs are more expensive for this Kickstarter to compensate for any rewards that include socks or tote bags! If you choose pins only - don't worry! I will automatically upgrade your shipping to signed for / tracked so that you don't feel as though your shipping costs have been wasted Thu, Jan 10 2019 4:24 am EST Can I upgrade to tracked shipping? Thu, Jan 10 2019 4:24 am EST Why should I upgrade my shipping to tracked? Unfortunately, the Royal Mail can only reimburse costs of tracked or signed for mail. If you leave your package as standard, there is no way for me to keep track of where it is if it gets lost or delayed and I can't claim to reimburse your costs for you (or myself if missing items are replaced!) Thu, Jan 10 2019 4:24 am EST When should I expect my rewards? After funding ends on the 23rd of January, all funds are collected within one week. Funds should then be sent to me by the 6th of February. I will not be able to order the pins from my manufacturer until after the 14th so I expect them to arrive to me mid-March.  I then have to check through all pins and package them up so I anticipate sending everything late March but will keep you updated! Socks and tote bags however are produced in the UK so anyone who only chooses a tote or socks as a reward will receive their items sooner! Thu, Jan 10 2019 4:24 am EST ?  ""]",6

121,643979114,"["" What platforms are supported? Windows, OSX and Linux will all be supported. Ports to further platforms will be considered at a later date, but that is a lower priority for the project. Tue, Nov 15 2016 4:17 pm EST Why are the tiers so expensive? Many kickstarters offer a lot of exciting rewards cheaply, because they don’t really need the money for development - they treat Kickstarter as a cheap marketing platform. We cannot afford that. Underselling, overpromising and offering physical goods are all a liability for many Kickstarters, and we want to be secure and realistic in everything we offer. Tue, Nov 15 2016 4:18 pm EST Why a custom engine? A custom engine involves more initial work to set up than using the likes of Unity, but in the long-term produces a hosts of benefits. It gives us more flexibility to make changes specific to the project, and in particular makes procedural generation techniques much easier to develop. It also makes us less dependent on an engine service that can lose support or change ownership in future. Tue, Nov 15 2016 4:18 pm EST Why a 3D roguelike? Firstly, we want Jupiter Hell to look amazing. Secondly, we think there are a class of gamers out there who have never tried a traditional roguelike, potentially being turned off by basic graphics or intimidating interfaces. The likes of the new X-COM games have shown that with more modern looks you can pull in bigger audiences and get them hooked on more engaging mechanics than most popular games offer. Jupiter Hell could be the game to get a new generation hooked into this awesome and underappreciated genre. Tue, Nov 15 2016 4:18 pm EST Why so much money? This is an ambitious project, especially with the sound and visuals required to make a really mind-blowing game. This money is needed to properly fund dedicated and professional staff to work solidly on Jupiter Hell, whilst also providing contingency to fund us through any potential setbacks. We have seen too many underfunded projects struggle to achieve their overpromised aims - this level of funding will let us avoid that pitfall. Tue, Nov 15 2016 4:18 pm EST Why so little money? Jupiter Hell is relying on a small team, and doesn’t need the millions that AAA games rely on. Having much of our staff concentrated in Eastern Europe also helps keep many costs down. Tue, Nov 15 2016 4:18 pm EST What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow? What do you mean? An African or European swallow? Tue, Nov 15 2016 4:18 pm EST Will there be multiplayer or any online component? The main focus is on a single player experience. There will be online highscores and other meta gameplay elements (weekly seeds, ghost files, etc), but true multiplayer is not planned at this stage. Tue, Nov 15 2016 4:18 pm EST Will there be support for mods? Yes! Mods are awesome and we will fully support the modding community. Tue, Nov 15 2016 4:18 pm EST Is this like Alien Breed / Shadowgrounds? No. (Those games are awesome, mind!) It shared the same top-down perspective, but the gameplay is very different - it's turn-based, tactical, relying on clever decision making rather than twitch shooting. Sun, Nov 20 2016 9:43 am EST ?

The $2,500 is only the MINIMUM that must be raised to fund the project through Kickstarter. You can still pledge and receive the rewards until MIDNIGHT June 30th. Sun, Jun 5 2016 1:34 pm EDT ""P.J. Jacobs Working Title"" is a strange name for the documentary. Is that really what you\'re going to call it? No. That\'s just a generic ""placeholder"" for where the title would be in the graphics. Truth is, we really don\'t know what it\'s title will be yet. Why? Because until we complete principal shooting, there is always the possibility that some unknown aspect of the story will be the driving force in the documentary, and will dictate the title. So hang on to your seats: the adventure is just beginning!!! Sun, Jun 5 2016 1:38 pm EDT If you raise more than $2,500, what will you do with the extra money? The Kickstarter goal amount is only a minimum pledge amount for Kickstarter funding.  It will not cover the entire amount of the production since the producers will also use some of their own funds as well. However, what the additional funding does do is help raise the production values used on the film. That means things like being able to pay for  more/better historical film clip rights, or being able to spend more time during the principal shoot and get even better raw footage for the project. Sun, Jun 5 2016 1:46 pm EDT What happens if you don\'t reach the $2,500 goal by June 30? As with all Kickstarter projects, If the project succeeds in reaching its funding goal, all backers\' credit cards are charged when time expires. If the project falls short, no one is charged. Funding on Kickstarter is all-or-nothing. Fri, Jun 17 2016 1:28 pm EDT ?  ']",4

316,1775676642,"["" Will the Graïnne Cover Variant be available after Kickstarter? Wed, Sep 13 2017 7:32 pm EDT What happens when the project ends? Kickstarter takes 2 weeks before sending the funds to me. Then I can pay the printer, send the files over to them and we begin the manufacturing process. Wed, Sep 13 2017 7:32 pm EDT When will Authorities That Be be shipped? According to the KrakenPrint estimate and with a little bit of buffer for unexpected delays, we’re looking at February 2018 for the arrival of the books to your homes. Wed, Sep 13 2017 7:32 pm EDT Why is shipping Authorities That Be so expensive outside of the US? This thick and bootyful book is estimated to weigh between 2 and 2.5 lbs and that is expensive to ship. We're staying on the safe side. Wed, Sep 13 2017 7:32 pm EDT Does Authorities That Be come in another language? The book only comes in English as of now because printing in another language means printing a whole other book. Fortunately, the comic is translated to French and you will be able to choose between English and French for all your PDF files. FR: La BD n'est imprimée qu'en Anglais pour le moment parce que ça coûterait double de l'imprimer dans une autre langue. Heureusement, la BD est traduite et tous vos PDF viennent en Français aussi! Wed, Sep 13 2017 7:32 pm EDT Can we order more than one book? Fri, Oct 13 2017 7:54 pm EDT Can I get both covers? 10/13 Update: Yes. You can add the other cover to your pledge in the final survey at the end of the campaign! Fri, Oct 13 2017 7:54 pm EDT Can I get both French and English PDFs? You will be asked in a survey at the end of the campaign in which language you prefer to receive your PDFs. If you wish to receive both, answering with no preference will get you both languages. Thu, Sep 21 2017 11:04 pm EDT Does the Private Commission get featured into the book? No. The private commissions will be completed after I’ve sent all the files to the printer and will have nothing to do with the actual book. The commissions can also be any subject. Fri, Sep 29 2017 7:38 am EDT How can I get in the book? You cannot be into this first book as it is already finished but you can take the Immortal Cameo Reward to become a detailed background character into the next book! This reward is very limited. Available while it lasts. Fri, Sep 29 2017 7:38 am EDT How many characters can I ask for in the Private Commission? There is a limit of three. Extra characters will require extra costs if you wish to add more of them, which we can agree upon after the campaign is over. Fri, Sep 29 2017 7:38 am EDT Can I get a private commission from you outside of Kickstarter? Fri, Sep 29 2017 7:38 am EDT How large can we ask the printing file to be for a Private Commission? The maximum on the largest side would be 32 inches. Keep in mind that the largest the file, the longer it will take to complete the art. TAKE NOTE: Requesting a large artwork in combination with a tight deadline will result in an extra charge. Sat, Sep 30 2017 7:14 pm EDT How soon can I get the Private Commission done? If you have a deadline for your commission, make sure to let me know as soon as the campaign is over. Also have any reference ready for me when we start to speed-up the process (for example, photos of your wife or pet) and clearly state what you want. Visuals examples are great. If all communication is quick and efficient on your part, I can push the artwork within a couple of weeks. Have a clear idea in mind. Prepare before we start so I can jump right into painting.

We strongly believe that the world needs more African narratives created by Africans. Often, the challenge is not desire, competence or ambition but resources. We have all been doing this work, in different ways (photography, film, art, writing etc.), using our own resources. However, this trip will enable us to bring our efforts together; do this work on a bigger scale; achieve greater impact; and reach a wider audience. We decided to involve you all and demonstrate what can happen when we pool our resources together. Mon, Dec 19 2016 2:48 pm EST Why 10 weeks?

Time to take in the vibe of a place, meet and talk to its inhabitants, process and then decide what is the most honest and respectful way to capture it and share this with the world. In addition to this, driving long distances, without taking adequate breaks, would take its toll on us and compromise our ability to stay healthy and produce good work.

If we unlock the chance to reprint that deck, you will have the OPTION to either choose between SILVER or GOLD. If you would like BOTH decks you can either add $45 to your current pledge OR choose a new pledge option that I will make once they are unlocked. (option 1) After the goal is unlocked, I will be creating a new reward package where you can pledge to receive both the silver and gold Tarot. It is an easiest way to update your pledge. You would just need to go to the main page and find  the new reward box that says ""GOLD + SILVER DECKS"". When you click on the box it will say ""Select this reward instead"". Then you just need to confirm the change. (option 2) If you do NOT want to choose the new reward package (specifically those of you who are early birds or have packages that contain specific items) You can ADD ON the Silver deck by adding $40 to your current pledge. You will then answer in the survey at the end of the campaign that you would like to receive both the Gold and Silver editions. (option 3) If you have pledged for the ""Double Decker"", that price will stay the same because the second deck is already discounted. You may still choose which colors you prefer. However, if you would like to add a THIRD DECK it will only be $35. Let me know if you have any other questions! Sat, May 25 2019 9:29 am EDT How do I add on an item? Add-ons are available for almost all of the reward options. All of these add-ons are listed in the description of each pledge reward. When you are selecting your reward you have the option to pay extra  in order to add other items. IF YOU HAVE NOT PLEDGED YET: Each reward will say something like ""Pledge $45 or more"". After you select your reward you will be taken to a pledge confirmation page. On that page you will see there is a text box where you have the option change the amount of your pledge. (Kickstarter automatically adds shipping to the deck. If you are in the US, the amount will say $50). So if you would like to add on a pin, you would type $60 in the text box for your pledge amount. When you do this, I will be able to see that you have paid extra for your reward. I will message you and ask you which of the add-ons you would like to add to your pledge. IF YOU HAVE ALREADY PLEDGED: When you go to the project page you will see that your pledge is now listed first with a blue banner saying ""you selected"". There is a green banner at the top of the page that says ""you are a backer!"". Click on either of these links and they will take you to another page to ""manage your pledge"".

I tested this out myself within a 24 hour window and it worked amazingly even after being stuck up several times.

Words will be adopted first-come, first-served, in the order that you backed the project (not the order that you fill out the form). So the earlier you back our Kickstarter, the better! Sat, Sep 19 2015 11:56 am EDT How can I tell what words have already been adopted? Just look them up on Wordnik! If they’re adopted, they will show their adopter’s name. Tue, Sep 15 2015 11:17 am EDT What if someone else has already adopted the word I want? We are sorry. :-( But we’re happy to help you find another beautiful word! Tue, Sep 15 2015 11:17 am EDT What do I do if I want to adopt more than one word? To adopt more words, just add $25 per extra word to your backer donation (for the awards that include adopted words). Please only add extra words at the $25 and $45 levels. If you want extra words at other levels, email us! Tue, Sep 15 2015 9:22 pm EDT I found this word you said was “missing” in another dictionary! We’ve only been checking OED and MW3, as they are the largest, and are often considered the “dictionaries of record” for English. If you found a missing word in another dictionary, that makes us very happy! We’ll still add examples for it, though, to help the people who use Wordnik. Tue, Sep 15 2015 11:17 am EDT Aren’t all these words already in the Urban Dictionary? Some of them definitely are! We think the Urban Dictionary is tops (hi Aaron!), and we have lots of fun using it. But with Wordnik, we want to show direct evidence of how words are used, through real sentences that show how a word is used in context. (And we link you to the source so you can better understand who uses a word, and why.) Tue, Sep 15 2015 11:17 am EDT You keep using that word. I don’t think it means what you think it means. Words often have several meanings or shades of meaning. We encourage discussions! You can look up any word on Wordnik (even if we have no data at all for it yet!) and leave your take in the comments section — just log in first. (But we still recommend against becoming involved in a land war in Asia.) Tue, Sep 15 2015 11:17 am EDT This word is useless! That’s okay, you don’t have to use it! Here, have this word instead, it’s very useful! https://www.wordnik.com/words/croodle Also: was that a question? Tue, Sep 15 2015 11:17 am EDT I want to back your project so I can adopt a word, but you don’t have any data for it. Can I still adopt it? Yes, please adopt it! We will be prioritizing adopted words and adding new data to them (where it exists!) first. Tue, Sep 15 2015 11:17 am EDT Can I make up a word to adopt? Yes! Tue, Sep 15 2015 11:17 am EDT I’d like to back your project but the word I want to adopt has some dumb examples. Can those be cleaned up? As part of our project, we will be refreshing and cleaning sentences across the site, and adopted words will get cleaned up first. Tue, Sep 15 2015 11:17 am EDT Can I access the raw data? We want to be able to make the data we find openly licensed, and we’re looking into ways to do that now. If you have a specific use case in mind, please email us! It will help us with our planning. Tue, Sep 15 2015 11:17 am EDT Will you share with Wiktionary and Urban Dictionary? Yes! We would be very happy if Wiktionary editors used our API to add example sentences to Wiktionary entries. We use Wiktionary definitions, so fair’s fair! Tue, Sep 15 2015 11:17 am EDT What if Oxford and Merriam-Webster start adding all these missing words? We will be very, very happy. (Especially if they work out all the etymologies.) We want all English words to be lookupable! Tue, Sep 15 2015 11:17 am EDT I want the poster! Will you be selling it separately? We won't be selling the Kickstarter poster separately -- that will be unique for backers. If there's interest we may do a different poster. Tue, Sep 15 2015 11:17 am EDT I’m super-into machine learning! How can I find out more about how you’ll find these sentences? We’ll be blogging about the process and sending updates to backers. Tue, Sep 15 2015 11:17 am EDT I want to help Wordnik in a different way! We love volunteers! Email us at feedback@wordnik.com! Tue, Sep 15 2015 11:17 am EDT Does a word have to be in a dictionary before I can use it? Nope. Tue, Sep 15 2015 12:59 pm EDT Does the poster reward include a word adoption? The poster is a stand-alone reward ... but if you really want a joint poster + adoption reward, please let us know! Tue, Sep 15 2015 12:59 pm EDT Who made your video? Matthew Green, of Matthewtown.

Thu, Apr 27 2017 9:10 pm EDT how long do we get recorded streaming I want to say ""forever and ever"" or ""as long as we both shall live"" or something like that.   But the reality of the internet is wacky.   I have one huge website that is now 19 years old (javaranch/coderanch) and another that is 21 years old (richsoil/permies) so I think I can safely say ""at least a decade - probably much more.""

Tue, May 2 2017 10:46 pm EDT How soon after the sessions do you anticipate releasing the \'download\' version of the videos? I would say a week or two after the ATC. Thu, May 4 2017 8:01 pm EDT Provided we have the hard drive space and the desire, could we have the option of a high-def download as well? We are considering it.  There are a lot of complicated bits and bobs to work out.  We have worked out bandwidth for streaming HD to be much lower than 360p file transfers.  At the same time, there are variables to nail down like ""how big will the files be?""  For our last project 360p files were about 0.8 gigs and the 1080p files were about 15 gigs.  To pull the event off, we are currently testing a lot of equipment, and we are testing a lot of internet options.  For the people that have paid $150, we want to give them the live 360p stream, and then it will take even more bandwidth to upload the HD stuff - and we would like them to have those files within hours. Bottom line:  right now we are already doing a lot of gambling with a lot of variables.  We will be able to have clearer answers on this in july. Fri, May 5 2017 7:16 pm EDT Will the course be available to purchase on DVD for people that have dreadful internet connections? That would be something like 100 DVDs.  So, no.  BUT!  Once we are all done with the event, it is possible that we might offer something as a jump drive.   But there are way too many variables right now to be able to offer something like that. Sat, May 6 2017 4:00 pm EDT I see you added the new reward ""ALLFORMATS"".  Is that included in ""BUNDLE""?  Did you forget to add ""ALLFORMATS"" to ""BUNDLE""? Kickstarter does not allow me to change a reward once somebody has selected one of those rewards.   Which makes it hard to insert new rewards.   At the same time, my experience with fulfilling stuff is that there are lots of people helping and ...  if you say one thing but provide another thing, and there is any room left for alternative interpretation, things become less than optimal. So when coming up with the new rewards, I embraced that I cannot change the existing rewards and selected dollar values and wording to make it clear what is offered. That is why the ""DESIGN"" level contains everything in ""BUNDLE"" and everything in ""ALLFORMATS"" and so much more. Mon, May 22 2017 9:34 am EDT ?  ']",8

You\'ll receive the month of December photo in which 23 women are gathered around the grand piano on stage at the Tabor Opera House! It\'s a spectacular composition of tastefully uncovered women scattered among those in magnificent Victorian attire! We used the 2003 film ""Calendar Girls"" as our inspiration! Wed, Sep 20 2017 3:02 pm EDT Why did you pick age 50 and older for your models? Although the common rule for something to be considered antique is that it be 100 years or older, according to an article in mentalfloss.com, “An exception to this rule is cars and other items that are subject to frequent wear—they can be called antique when they are over 25 years old.” All my volunteer models have agreed that they’ve been subject to frequent wear, so splitting the difference between 25 and 100 gave us our new 50-year antique designation! But...as you\'ll see in the calendar...none of us feels ""antique""! Thu, Sep 21 2017 12:10 pm EDT Is this a ""family friendly"" calendar? Certainly! Our models and our photographer ensured that the props used for each photo shoot were well placed to provide what we considered to be ""appropriate"" coverage. Some of our models are more covered than others, and there are plenty of curves to be seen, but this calendar is also a joyful celebration of real women\'s bodies. Sun, Sep 24 2017 11:06 am EDT If I pledge $10 or more, do I really have to wait till November to receive my perpetual gratitude? Great question! After extensive discussion with our team (nope...didn\'t happen), we agreed that our perpetual gratitude would become effective immediately upon your pledge. It\'s yours to keep forever even if we don\'t make our goal (but we will)! Wed, Oct 4 2017 6:14 pm EDT ?  ']",4

Doesn’t that make it more safe? “Rehoming fees” have become a real buzz word in recent years. These “rehoming fees” that are exchanged between parties don’t guarantee a safer “transaction”. In fact, they might even do more harm than good. What ensures a positive adoption experience is quality communications between the current owner and the potential adopter. Meeting one another in person and each party asking thoughtful questions about the animal will likely ensure a positive outcome for the pet than any “fee” could ever ensure.  With Home To Home™, no one is in it to make money. It’s intention is to help find the next best home for the pet. When you remove a monetary exchange, then you know intentions are likely good. Thu, Apr 9 2020 1:56 pm EDT Why would someone give away their pet?! Are they bad people?! Thu, Apr 9 2020 1:56 pm EDT How do you ensure that the animal is healthy? Thu, Apr 9 2020 1:56 pm EDT How do you ensure that the animal is going to a good home? Thu, Apr 9 2020 1:56 pm EDT How do you know that the person posting their pet isn’t lying about its history? We don’t. There is no way we can know that, and neither can a shelter. Again, it is our belief that more often than not, people of positive intentions. Generally speaking, we find that people are honest about their pet’s history. To date, we have not had one case of anyone informing us otherwise. Thu, Apr 9 2020 1:56 pm EDT Why doesn’t the shelter just take the animal? Shelters across the U.S. operate at various levels, depending on their staffing capacity, budget, and kennel space (among many other things!). Yes, a shelter might be able to take the animal, but it also might mean that another animal that’s been in the shelter has to be euthanized so that the new incoming animal can take it’s kennel space. It’s a hard reality, but a reality none-the-less. Thu, Apr 9 2020 1:56 pm EDT How do I know I am getting a healthy pet when I adopt via HH? By asking the right questions and having a meaningful conversation with the current owner. Sometimes, the animal might have some health issues. The great thing is - you can ask the owner directly and learn about the animal first hand! Thu, Apr 9 2020 1:56 pm EDT ?  ']",8

Meanwhile, we\'ll be working with bookstores and various retailers to ensure New York in Quarantine is widely available in 2021. Preordering on Kickstarter will ensure you receive this book as early as possible. Wed, Sep 30 2020 10:14 am EDT Where are the books being printed?

While we\'d love to hold a gallery opening for the book\'s debut, offering exclusive invites to all the backers, we\'ve opted to forgo this perk until a vaccine or treatment is widely available.

Wed, Sep 30 2020 10:14 am EDT Will ‘New York in Quarantine’ be hard or softcover?

Their work includes, but isn\'t limited to, fighting COVID-19. As per Kickstarter guidelines, which state that projects can\'t raise funds directly for charity, all contributions will be put towards designing, printing, and distributing this book.

636,302556197,"["" What will the glass or t-shirt have on it? Will it be a Beau's logo? The rewards for this project will be branded in the name of the brewery in Rwanda, not Beau's! The brewery in Rwanda is not yet named, or branded, however which is why images are not available of these rewards. The name of the brewery will be established by owner of the brewery, Fina, and the branding will be done by designers in Rwanda as well. Wed, Oct 5 2016 11:24 pm EDT How come beer from the brewery is not offered as a reward? There are two reasons for this! One is that Kickstarter does not allow beer (or any other alcohol) to be offered as a reward. The second reason is that the brewery itself is not open yet, and the beer is currently in the recipe  development phase, and is not ready for sale yet. Mon, Nov 7 2016 1:24 pm EST What is the beer scene like in Rwanda right now? Will this be the first craft brewery? There is a strong market for beer in Rwanda, where it is a popular beverage. Beer is consumed in homes, and out at restaurants and pubs. There are no craft breweries currently operating in Rwanda. Comparable to Canada in the ‘80s or early ‘90s, beer styles are limited in Rwanda and unless it is homebrewed, beer in Rwanda is produced by foreign-owned companies (Heineken, and Skol). Mon, Nov 7 2016 1:28 pm EST Who will own the Rwanda Brewery? Fina Uwineza will be the initial owner, and she has intentions of opening up ownership to her brewmaster when hired, and potentially other key employees. Mon, Nov 7 2016 1:28 pm EST Is this a “sister” brewery to Beau’s? No. Beau’s (and the other partners) will have no ownership in Fina’s brewery, and will take no profit. Mon, Nov 7 2016 1:28 pm EST How many people will the brewery employ? We expect 5-15. It is anticipated that the bulk of the jobs created by this project will be agricultural (growing ingredients) and will impact rural communities. Mon, Nov 7 2016 1:28 pm EST Why is this project significant to the empowerment of women? Two decades after the Rwanda genocide, women have emerged as the country’s nation-builders as creators of jobs, driving forces behind the establishment of a vibrant private sector. Rwanda has recently been ranked the Best Place to be a Woman in Africa, according to the Global Gender Gap Report, and ranked 6th overall in the world in terms of closing gender gaps. It is also one of the most encouraging and supportive places to be a woman entrepreneur in Africa. Rwanda is highly progressive in seeing entrepreneurship as a key driver for transformation, economic development and business growth in its country, particularly for women. Mon, Nov 7 2016 1:28 pm EST What local brewing ingredients are currently being considered? The goal is to make tasty beer with as many local ingredients possible, so that the economic benefits of the Rwanda Brewery extend to the value chain. Possibilities include sorghum, millet, banana, coffee and cassava. There is more cassava available in Rwanda than is being harvested, and other African countries are using it in beer-making. Locally available spicings are also being studied, and we are looking at the feasibility of hop-growing in the region. Beer typically requires some barley malt or classic cereals, as it contributes important enzymes to beer. Areas that grow coffee are also suitable for growing malting barley, and some is currently being grown in Kenya – so we know it can be grown in Africa. Like cassava, barley is not a typical food source in Africa. There is even a possibility of spin-off economy to growing brewing ingredients in Rwanda for the rest of Africa. Mon, Nov 7 2016 1:28 pm EST What about drought and water supply? Drought is not uncommon in Rwanda – in the life of the Rwanda craft brewery, it will see good and bad weather, and needs to sustain itself through both. The team is looking towards brewing with some percentage of ingredients that are drought-resistant, such as sorghum and cassava. Making beer does consume water – but also produces an end product that is typically more than 90% water in content. We are lucky to have Christian Riemerschmid von der Heide from NSI on the consultation team, who, among his other skills, is an expert in water conservation issues in brewing. He notes that water supply issues are common in most part of Africa, and are typically either pollution or drought-based. He has seen models where breweries can be part of the solution, such as becoming a source of clean water, and supplying all employees with free clean drinking water to take home. We will be applying his expertise to this project. Mon, Nov 7 2016 1:28 pm EST What is Uwineza’s background? Fina Uwineza is one of the many women entrepreneurs blazing a trail of enterprise that is driving one of the African continent’s most gender-friendly economic development revolutions from Kigali, Rwanda. Rwandan-born, Fina fled with her family to neighbouring Burundi while a child of roughly 10 years old. She completed her College studies in Kenya taking Travel management, returning to Burundi to work for Transami Air Cargo. In 1992, she came to Canada where she has family and did a refresher tourism course at Algonquin College in Canada’s capital city of Ottawa. In 1998, Fina returned to Rwanda to live with her husband and three sons. She chose to apply her own global travel experiences, studies and work apprenticeships in the sector to start her own business as a restauranteur. She applied her tireless energy and innovative nature to a first-to-market concept bringing Chinese food to the city of Kigali. Launching the Flamingo Restaurant in 2000, Fina rapidly made a name for herself as the restaurant became the go-to place for tourists, foreign dignitaries, visiting corporate executives and local government leaders ready to taste the Asian cuisine. It quickly became a preferred venue for special occasions, business meals and a unique space for special events. One restaurant became two, making the Flamingo brand synonymous with international-class food and hospitality. Fina speaks in English, French, Kinyarwanda and Swahili. As a passionate and successful entrepreneur she is also ardently committed to continuing the strength and position of Rwanda as one of the top four African economies. Mon, Nov 7 2016 1:28 pm EST ?

If you want 2x Namtso Tee, 1x Nomad Crew, and 1x Kailash ¼ Zip, then the cheapest option is the Complete Kit Bundle + an add-on Namtso Tee.

It will also ask for the address to which you would like them sent. Sun, Nov 26 2017 4:10 am EST How do I add to my pledge? You can't pledge more than once, but if you decide to increase your pledge because you would like to add a pair of trousers or a pocket, you can do so by 'amending pledge' and adding to your pledge.  Don't worry if it isn't clear what you would like, to pledge towards, I will send out a survey if the campaign is successful to ask which items, colours and sizes you would like.  If you are unsure, send me a message. Sun, Nov 26 2017 4:10 am EST Can I order more than one pair in different sizes? Yes, you can.  Just add the amount to your pledge, and if they are going to different addresses, don't forget the postage charge.  At the end of the campaign, if it has been a success, I will send out a survey asking exactly what your requirements are in terms of sizes, colours and addresses.  If you are unsure, just send me a message. Sun, Nov 26 2017 4:10 am EST What is Kickstarter? What is Kickstarter?  Kickstarter is a crowd funding web-site which enables start-up and innovative projects, like Hoydens, to seek funding pledges from potential backers/supporters.  Each project identifies a target funding goal, in my case £10,000, and requests pledges.  I am offering to supply trousers and/or pockets depending on the level of pledge offered.  If the goal is met then the pledges are collected and the project is initiated.  If the project does not attract sufficient backing then the people who have made pledges are not charged and the project owner does not receive anything.  It is a relatively safe place for project initiators and backers to help launch new products. Please support me.   I am using Kickstarter to help fund the first production run.  If it is a success then we will place the orders on our manufacturer and open up the Hoydens on-line store in January to take normal orders.  Be one of the first to receive your Hoydens and make a pledge on Kickstarter. Thu, Dec 14 2017 11:46 am EST Are the trousers ethically sourced? Great question. I have a manufacturer in Portugal all lined up that my production manager knows well and assures me is fine. However without seeing it with my own eyes I am not going to claim anything just to get the sales. Once production starts I will visit with a camera and make sure. The fabric is fine and from a great supplier in Lancashire, but again, until I see with my own eyes I won’t be sure. I really want this product to be ethically sourced, but as a newbie in the industry with hardly any cash I have to place my trust in people until I can afford to visit. Once I am sure and have had advice on what to look for and what questions to ask, then I will put it on the website. Until then no claiming to be anything that I’m not.

Next, add the total value of the add-ons you\'d like to your pledge. For example, if you want three Building Bundles, you\'d select the ""City Center"" pledge.  If you want to include three $30 Add-on sets, you\'d pledge for a total of $350: the amount of the City Center Pledge + $90 of Add-ons. If you\'d like to increase your pledge, click the “Manage your pledge"" button that appears next to your pledge amount.  There you can change your pledge level and/or pledge amount. Wed, Jul 1 2020 2:16 pm EDT What is the scale of these buildings? These are designed with 28-35mm figures in mind.  They work great with most miniature games that are on the market today.  Most of the miniatures pictured in the campaign are our Cyberpunk RED miniatures, which are a true-32mm.   Crisis Protocol is a 38mm game and those miniatures work well and are on the large side, but look suitably heroic. True 28mm figures, like old-school GW minis also look good and are on the smaller end of what works. Mon, Jul 6 2020 10:00 am EDT I just want to order Add-Ons - how do I do that? No problem - just pledge at the ""Scouting Level"" pledge, for the value of the Add-on sets you want to order. Most of the Add-on sets are $30 each. For example, if you wanted to order 3 sets of Chainlink Fences and the City Streets set, you would pledge for $120. Wed, Jul 1 2020 2:17 pm EDT What will it cost to ship internationally? For this campaign, we\'re focused on products that are made in our USA office.  These buildings are sturdy - and heavy.  How much shipping will cost really depends on how many buildings you\'re ordering.  If you want a more exact quote, send us an email at info@monsterfightclub.com with what you\'d like your pledge to include. Wed, Jul 1 2020 2:17 pm EDT When do I choose my buildings? After the campaign ends, you\'ll get a link to the pledge manager.   In the pledge manager, you\'ll choose which building bundles you\'d like, and which style you\'d like for each of them. In the pledge manager, you\'ll also be able to add other items: Game Mats, Add-ons, or sets from our previous campaigns. Everyone who pledges get access to the pledge manager, but pledging before the campaign ends really helps to keep the momentum going and unlocks more stretch goals - improving everyone\'s pledge! Wed, Jul 1 2020 2:17 pm EDT How do the stretch soals work?  If I order multiple buildings, do I get multiple stretch goals? Yes and no - it depends on the stretch goal.  Some stretch goals add one free item to every pledge shipment.  The first one, the graffiti wall, works like this: all physical shipments will get one free graffiti wall. Some stretch goals increase the contents of a set, like adding a free steel drum to the chainlink fences set or adding manhole covers to the sidewalk set.  Other stretch goals add something free to every building bundle, so the higher your pledge, the more of those you\'ll get (like the ladder and camera). You can check out the Stretch Goals section of the campaign for full details on each, or send us a message if you want a detailed run-down for the specific pledge level you\'re interested in. Wed, Jul 1 2020 2:17 pm EDT For the STL package, what\'s included?  Do the files come with supports?

Currently, this is over 120 separate files (pieces). Some pieces, like the sidewalks or signs, are flat shapes.  For the physical versions of these, the detail is printed on the surface.  For the STLs, you\'ll have the shape and the connectors, but any surface printing or painting will be up to you to. The files come unsupported.  You\'ll need to be familiar with how to make supports for your 3D printer. Mon, Jul 6 2020 7:10 pm EDT ?  ']",7

831,1067166164,"[' Why are you on Kickstarter? We’re on Kickstarter because we need your backing to 1) make people aware of just how far underwear can go beyond being, just, well, underwear, and 2) hit the minimums we need for a cost-effective manufacturing run that will meet the quality standards we’ve set for ourselves. Doing small quantities would require us to compromise on either cost or quality and also limit colors and styles that we’re able to offer customers. By getting a bigger pool of support up front, we can deliver a better product at a better cost and ensure the success of the vision. Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT Are the trim and elastic recycled? Not in this run. While we want to be as eco-friendly as possible, we weren’t satisfied with the performance and appearance of the limited recycled options. We will keep exploring for the next production run to find one that meets our quality standards to ensure a durable product. Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT Where is your factory? We work with a small factory based in the Shanghai area. They have about 70 on staff and Lana has met personally with them to ensure they meet our ethical and quality standards. They provide fair wages, good working conditions, and treat their workers like family. Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT Why not manufacture in the US? Our goal is to provide an accessible, sustainable price point so that more people can wear our products. Our mission to innovate on underwear, empower you to *do*, and promote eco-friendly manufacturing practices. After learning more about the industry, we realized that we had to take a more holistic view of ethics and sustainability since fashion is a globalized industry, no matter what country comes after the “made in…” on the tag. Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT Is everything in the SOMI line machine washable? Yes! (Gentle wash recommended) Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT What sizes and colors are available? Every item will be available in black and more colors will be added as we reach funding goals! Please see our size chart and style descriptions for what sizes they will be available in. Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT Why aren’t The Versatile and The Minimalist style offered in XL+ sizes? We want to provide the best possible customer experience and we have found those sizes did not test well. Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT Why do I have to wait for The Versatile and other styles to be added to the campaign? In order to meet order minimums with the factory, we need to produce at least a certain number of any given style. Same with ordering fabric. These quantities are to ensure we hit minimums. Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT How will we choose the color for the $300k stretch goal? By popular vote! Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT Which tops are best for working out? The Betty and The Deep Dive are best for low impact workouts. So think yoga and pilates, not running. Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT Which tops are best for swimming? Any of them! Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT What top styles are best for a larger chest? The Betty and Deep Dive have the most coverage. Order according to your band size since our fabric has stretch. Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT Are the straps adjustable on all styles? Yes. Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT Are any of the tops padded? No, they’re unlined but double-layered. Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT How many water bottles go into one SOMI set? 6 Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT What is the benefit of the anti-bacterial coating? It helps keep your undies smelling fresh! Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT How should I decide which size is best for me? Use our sizing chart. For tops, prioritize your band size (the width around your ribcage, right underneath the breasts) since our fabric has a lot of leeway in sizing. Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT What is your exchange policy? Tops can be exchanged if not worn, bottoms are final sale. If something doesn’t fit, get in touch with us directly and we’ll make sure to make things right! Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT Where will I be able to purchase SOMI sets after the campaign ends and how much will they cost? At somiapparel.com. $58 for tops, and $28 for bottoms. Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT Can you please break down the fabric composition of SOMI underwear? SustainLuxe is 79% recycled poly and 21% spandex. Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT Is this breathable? Is it safe to wear down there? Yes. Not all fibers are created equal. SustainLuxe features premium recycled poly and elastane woven in a proprietary weaving pattern that results in light, breathable, moisture-wicking fabric. While cotton is good in some cases, getting sweaty or swimming is not one of them since water wouldn’t evaporate. Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT What about microplastic pollution? Microplastics are tiny plastic threads that get released during washing. The worsT offender in microplastic pollution is poly fleece pieces, which release the most fibers. However, while this is undesirable, we wanted to balance the overall environmental impact. No textile is 100% perfect. We believe that the biggest issue in fashion is the volume of mindless consumption and garments practically designed to be disposed of. We believe that by creating multifunctional, durable pieces, we can reduce the number of bras and panties purchased. High quality recycled poly that makes our Sustainluxe fabric is surprising tough stuff! You can also prevent most microfibers by washing using our SOMI SeaSaver Washbag, which will trap microplastics inside its fine mesh. Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT How confident are you regarding your shipping timeline? SOMI will ship within the US 90 days after the campaign finish. While there’s always potentially room for delays in production, we’ve built-in 30-45 days of buffer time. If anything outside of our control comes up, we will be in constant contact with backers for updates. Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT Who is responsible for paying customs duties and taxes? Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT How do I pick which style of top/bottom I want? We’ll send out a survey at the end of the campaign. Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT How will Covid-19 impact production and delivery timelines? We have seen delays in manufacturing in China but most of the issues have eased up by now. The major delays are in air freight, not sea freight, so we don’t expect transportation to be a big hurdle. Our factory is back to full capacity, the only potential areas of delay is the availability of raw materials. We are committed to being transparent and honest about the process so you get a behind the scenes look at all that’s going on! Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT ?  ']",26

Like in most English-language news reports you might have seen on the refugee crisis, our aim is to find and interview refugees that can speak English. However, we do have an Arabic translator on standby in Strasbourg, France, in case we need him. He's ready to meet us at a moment's notice and is drafting some standard interview questions for us beforehand. Further, Audrey Courty is fluent in French and Turkish, and has an elementary grasp of Arabic and Indonesian. Wed, Sep 16 2015 3:47 am EDT It's going to be winter in Europe when you travel. Will this be a hindrance? We're prepared to adapt our travel plans to meet the changing nature of the refugee crisis, both manmade, like the closing of borders and the temporary suspension of Schengen (which is likely to change the route refugees will be trying to take to get into Europe), and natural ones, like the onset of winter. Safe to say, we'll be packing warm clothes! Wed, Sep 16 2015 4:00 am EDT Isn't this going to be a dangerous journey? We like to think of this as a backpacking trip through Europe, but instead of sight-seeing we'll be focused on documenting the journeys of refugees. We plan to check into hostels and BnBs as we travel. There wouldn't be any more risks in doing this than your average backpacking adventure. We will be taking insurance and the standard necessary precautions. Beyond that, as journalists, we take calculated risks on a daily basis in order to cover news, and we have developed a keen sense and situational awareness that inform whether or not a certain situation is beyond our capabilities.

840,687102801,"[' Why is it called ""Even Me""? The phrase ""even me"" is one of those idioms of Tanzanian English. It\'s used the way Americans would say, ""Me too,"" but coming from a child it sounds so sweet and touching. Always responding with a ""Yes, even you"" not only verifies that child\'s statement, but also confirms his or her essential human dignity. Fri, Jun 8 2012 10:52 am EDT Where will the paintings end up? Ultimately, I\'m not sure. However, I want to show the 24 piece collection anywhere that\'s big enough: airports, galleries, warehouses, banks, you name it. I am currently networking and making connections for venues now (so if you have any recommendations, let me know: jennathorp@gmail.com). I want to go big. The bigger I go, the more value each painting will hold, which will ultimately increase the price. Increasing the sales is crucial, as all proceeds will go to the child. Fri, Jun 8 2012 10:55 am EDT When will you start painting? I will start painting in August after I return to America. Sun, May 15 2011 2:07 pm EDT How long will it take to finish all 24 paintings? Originally, I thought I would finish all 24 paintings by 2014, but I don\'t want to compromise the quality of the work to reach a certain deadline. With that being said, I hope to finish in a timely manner. I am 100% dedicated to this project. Fri, Jun 8 2012 10:53 am EDT Why don\'t the paintings have eyes? “This makes no sense at all. Why would you paint portraits without eyes? The portrait isn’t complete, it’s unfinished – something is missing!” When this statement was directed towards me regarding my even me project, I couldn’t clearly explain why I was, indeed, leaving the eyes out of twenty-four portraits. The faces are large, and it’s quite noticeable that the eyes are missing. In fact, when I showed the first finished painting to Glory, the subject, the initial response from her sisters was, “Glory! Where are her eyes?” Nonetheless, I still hadn’t come up with an eloquent, genuine answer. Instead, I responded: it’s a new type of portrait; I’m exploring with artistic elements such as composition, negative space, and shape. Pre-verbally, it was more, but I couldn’t muster up the words without sounding hostile in myexplanation. However, now I am ready to tell you why I am not painting the eyes. In today’s society, we have access to anything, everything, all the time. On my way to work, I heard an advertisement for a smart phone. A small, curious boy asks his father a question, “Daddy, what are batteries made out of?” He didn’t know the answer off the top of his head, so the father quickly takes out his phone and, with a sigh of relief, types or speaks his son’s question. Within seconds, he explains, “Batteries are made out of five basic components: a resilient plasticcontainer, positive and negative internal plates made of lead, plate separators made of porous syntheticmaterial, electrolyte, a dilute solution of sulfuric acid and water, better known as battery acid, and lead terminals, the connection point between the batter and whatever it powers.” He is happy, his son is informed, and we are convinced to buy a smart phone. Convenient, immediate, accurate: the world is at our fingertips. Not only has technology given us the ability to know all the answers, but it has made every corner of theworld virtually accessible to anyone. I can see the Northern Lights, the ancient pyramids, the Taj Mahal, or the Petrified Forest with a few clicks. I can see whatever I want. This availability makes me wonder: if I’ve seen the images, have Iexperienced it? I know what it looks like, and my imagination can only take it from there. Imagine this situation: my friend recounts in great detail her trip to Zion National Park, and I respond with an unimpressed, “Oh, cool, well, I’ve seen pictures, Iknow.” Or, “Did you make it to Watchman trail, the one that takes about two hours? Hopefully you didn’t hike it during mid-day, because it gets pretty hot. The best time to hike it is either in the early morning or late afternoon. I’ve read all about it. I know.” We can Google Maps any remote spot in the world and speak as though we’ve been there, experienced it. What if all this access and availability is tricking us? Have we truly experienced by solely seeing? What about the other four senses?  What about the emotion and spirituality that come with these? Honestly, I haven’t lived Zion National Park – I don’t know what the canyons smell like, what the wind feels like, what the dust tastes like, or what the desert echoes sound like. So what happens when we see commercials about starving children in Tanzania? We see the white man holding the sickliest, most frail-looking child in an effort to convince us to get involved, to give money, or at least to reconsider tossing our leftovers in the wastebasket. This overplayed commercial has turned into a cliché. In a multitude of settings, school cafeterias, five star restaurants, at our own dinner tables, we hear: “(Child’s name), there are (adjective) kids in (country).”  This is followed by, “So eat your food.” Has the starving child only convinced us to clean our plates? Surely, that wasn’t the objective of the commercial. On the other hand, because we’ve seen the images of the Tanzanian child’s big eyes, her jigger-eaten toes, pointy ribs, and sorrowful face, we have visually experienced her situation. Because we’ve seen it, maybe we can imagine what it would be like, to some extent. But for the most part, we continue on with our normal day-to-day, guilt-free lives: after all, we’re here, they’re there. The reality is, the Tanzanian girl has seen. But she has also smelled, tasted, heard, and touched without needing to use her imagination. Those eyes may have seen her father kill his wife, and then himself. That nose may have smelled the fumes of alcohol that accompany physical abuse. Those lips may have tasted blood after being beaten by a jealous and contemptuous stepfather. Those earsmay have heard her mother, in an effort to support her family, moan as a stranger forces himself into her. And perhaps those fingers have held the paper with her national exam scores, while her heart felt the utter hopelessness caused by an impossible, corrupted test for which the schools cannot prepare their students, and which dictates an unfavorable future. And we think we’ve experienced something by seeing a photograph. Something is missing. Something is not quite right. Andthat is exactly what I want people to feel when they look at a wall of eyeless portraits: dissatisfaction. I hope that this emotion will evoke questions, “Why are the eyes missing?  What has this child seen?” I don’t want to tell the whole story, because we don’t know the whole story. Not one of us, me included, has any idea what these children have endured. If I give the impression that the whole story is told, like it appears to be in the starving children commercial, we leave unchanged. We feel as though we’ve experienced, and thus, can relate. If the eyes, the windows to one’s soul, remain unseen, we feel cheated. We feel wronged, like there is something more, but we can’t know it. Fri, Jun 8 2012 10:58 am EDT ?  ']",5

SKAPYA jackets quick convert into a bag which means you don’t have to carry your jacket in your hands, tie it around your waist – or even worse, kept it on and feel uncomfortable. Keep your hands free and avoid being frustrated with something tied around your waist. Mon, Oct 22 2018 10:12 am EDT What happens to the bits in the bag? The Patented technology of the pocket (the way it is constructed and the process of the transformation) means that whatever you have in the bag stays in the bag as it quickly and easily becomes the pocket of the jacket when you transform between functions. Mon, Oct 22 2018 10:12 am EDT Why not use a jacket and a back pack? More often than not, people are out and about without a bag, and when you want to take your jacket off you have no where to put it. Just like having a hood for the rain – you have a carry system when you need to take your jacket off. If you do have a rucksack – go ahead and put your SKAPYA jacket in it as you would any other. The pocket feature does not have to replace a rucksack, it transforms the flexibility and functionality of your jacket. You’ll never have to take a rucksack with you again just to carry a jacket and essentials. Mon, Oct 22 2018 10:12 am EDT Does it look weird? SKAPYA Jackets look awesome, the pocket functionality does not affect the way they look. Mon, Oct 22 2018 10:12 am EDT Can you feel the strap rig? To make the jackets work, only a small piece of fabric and the straps are added, these together weigh 40g in the Pioneer II Jacket which is designed for heavy use. You can’t feel the strap when you are wearing the jacket. Mon, Oct 22 2018 10:12 am EDT I’ve seen these before.. SKAPYA jackets have a patented pocket system that means whatever you have in your pocket you can get to when it is a bag and vice versa. This has not been done before. Mon, Oct 22 2018 10:12 am EDT Can’t decide whether or not to take a jacket out? SKAPYA jackets solve this problem too – take it as a bag with your phone, wallet, keys in it, if it gets colder or wetter your jacket is with you. The ultimate jacket for layering – you can have it one and zipped up against the elements or take it off completely and have it on your back without having to carry a rucksack. Mon, Oct 22 2018 10:12 am EDT What about jackets for ladies? The Pioneer II jackets have a generous cut around the hips and chest, but we haven’t had the capacity to make one yet that is cut to perfectly compliment the female form.

Mon, Oct 22 2018 10:12 am EDT Do the jackets only come in black? At the moment the jackets only come in black. I’ve found this best for NOT standing out from the crowd when you are travelling, it also hides dirt. The fabric comes in rolls of ½ a kilometre, so to experiment with colour is an expensive business for the future.. Mon, Oct 22 2018 10:12 am EDT How waterproof are the jackets? These jackets are designed to be as waterproof as possible. The fabric is incredibly waterproof and the jackets have features to keep water away from your skin and clothes, including the double storm flap, snipers cuffs, three way adjustable hood, water resistant zips, beaver tail, longer cut… Mon, Oct 22 2018 10:12 am EDT Where do I fill in my size? When the campaign funds, I’ll ask you for your size so the ladies can get going. Mon, Oct 22 2018 10:12 am EDT What kind of fit is the jacket? The Pioneer II jacket is a generous fit so you can move in it and fit layers underneath. Hem and waist single handed shock cord adjusters mean you can quickly and easily take in any excess. Mon, Oct 22 2018 10:12 am EDT What’s the best way for me to care for the jacket long term? It the fabric gets dirty, it can effect the waterproofing and breathability. Wash your jacket at a maximum of 40 degrees using soap suds (not powder or detergent). Let the jacket drip dry. Iron the outside on cool iron, test a corner of your jacket with your iron to make sure it doesn't burn it. The ironing rejuvenates the finish on the outside, helping the fabric to 'bead' and dry faster. Mon, Oct 22 2018 10:12 am EDT How heavy is the jacket? A Medium Jacket weighs 950g. It is tough and made to last. Mon, Oct 22 2018 10:12 am EDT Do you ship worldwide? Yes, let me have your address and I’ll do my best to get one to you. Check out the shipping costs on the campaign page. Mon, Oct 22 2018 10:14 am EDT What is your returns policy? Have a look at the size chart or get in touch to ask about sizing. These are being made to order and the Pioneer II jackets are being sold at a highly discounted price on Kickstarter. Unfortunately refunds can’t be made, but if the size really is not a good fit, let me know within 28 days of receiving your Jacket and we’ll do our very best to get one that does fit. You will have to cover the cost of return postage. Mon, Oct 22 2018 10:14 am EDT ?  ""]",18

At the moment we will do French, Spanish, Italian and Polish rules. Sun, Oct 25 2020 4:21 am EDT What can I expect from the „Debutant“ pledge for 5 €? You will receive updates and - most importantly - you will get access to the pledge manager at the end of the campaign. There you will have the opportunity to upgrade and get products to the kickstarter-price you can see in this campaign (games / add-ons). Beware, that the pledge manager will only be open for a short period after the campaign. Fri, Nov 20 2020 1:34 pm EST When will shipping be charged? At the end of the campaign we will use a pledge manager where the final shipping costs will be determined for each individual order. To see estimates, you can consult the shipping table on the campaign page. But please be aware, these are just estimates. Sun, Oct 25 2020 4:24 am EDT Will there be a pledge for retailers? No. The deluxe base game in the „Anthem“ pledge level and the deluxe base game + expansion in a bookshelf-case from the „Ode to Joy“ pledge level will be kickstarter exclusives and won’t be available for a retail distribution. Retailers who are interested in the „Grand Austria Hotel“ expansion be advised to get in touch with their Asmodee distribution unit for their region. As of now it is uncertain which unit (or licensing partners) will carry the expansion for retail distribution. Sun, Oct 25 2020 4:24 am EDT Can I get multiple copies of the game (group pledge)? Yes. New pledge levels for multiple copies have been added to this campaign. But please be aware that we only can do certain packages: 10 x „Let’s Waltz!“ expansion (Parade), 10 x „Let’s Waltz!“ expansion + upgrade pack (Polonaise) and 6 x „Let’s Waltz!“ expansion plus deluxe base game (Euphoria). Shipping costs will be charged extra after the campaign in the pledge manager.

Thu, Oct 29 2020 5:27 am EDT Will the deluxe base game and expansion bundle („Ode to Joy“ pledge level) be available in retail? No. As stock lasts the bookshelf-case will be available in the Lookout Games Webshop after this campaign. Sun, Oct 25 2020 4:24 am EDT Is this game (and the expansion) language independent? „Grand Austria Hotel“ and its expansion have no necessary in-game text. There are a few names on cards, that can be used to reference these cards in the rulebook. This cards can also be referenced using the card number. Sun, Oct 25 2020 4:24 am EDT Will there be a big box? No, but you will get the opportunity at the end of the campaign to get the bookshelf-case (as seen in the „Ode to Joy“ pledge level). Here you can place the expansion and your old base game to make a nice looking bundle for your game shelf. Sun, Oct 25 2020 6:13 am EDT What can you tell me about the deluxe upgrade-pack? Sun, Oct 25 2020 4:24 am EDT Where are the games produced?

Unfortunately it’s just not possible for any bike tracker to effectively secure network coverage and signal strength inside the frame, so instead we’ve selected low-profile yet secure mounting points, including around the bottle cage or under the bicycle saddle. This means you get the performance you need in terms of accurate tracking and long battery life...which are the most important factors in a device like this one. Wed, Nov 20 2019 11:46 am EST Does AIR work everywhere? Wed, Nov 20 2019 11:32 am EST How sturdy is it?  Can’t it just be knocked off or easily removed? AIR is designed to be sturdy and resist a level of attack but if there’s an attempt to remove or destroy the device, it will have already alerted the bike owner as to what’s happening. Wed, Nov 20 2019 11:32 am EST What kind of warranty does See.Sense AIR have? AIR comes with a two-year manufacturer’s warranty as standard. Wed, Nov 20 2019 11:32 am EST Why does the alarm sound like an alarm clock? We engineered the alarm with a tone that will be noticed...an alarm clock is a nice comparison as it’s an alert that people look out for and respond to. Wed, Nov 20 2019 11:32 am EST How does AIR know when your phone is nearby? AIR uses a Bluetooth connection to determine how close your phone is to the device, so we can ensure that it operates in ‘Fight’ or ‘Flight’ modes accordingly.  The SMS alert you receive will be sent over the mobile operator network. Wed, Nov 20 2019 11:32 am EST Can I use the app to see where my bike is even if it’s not under attack? Yes, you can query the current location of your AIR at any time via our mobile app. Wed, Nov 20 2019 11:32 am EST What if my phone runs out of charge? If your phone runs out of charge, AIR will go into Flight mode; the alarm will sound for 20 seconds and it’ll begin high-powered tracking. AIR will automatically reset the next time your phone comes into Bluetooth range. Wed, Nov 20 2019 11:32 am EST ?  ']",8

Mon, Nov 9 2015 2:42 pm EST So, boxers or boxer-briefs? As of right now, we are only offering boxer-briefs.

Please note that a few of our early bird perks are Heather Metal only due to production time constraints.

If/once our campaign is fully funded (cross your fingers!), we'll reach out to our backers via email to collect everyone's size preferences. Here's our sizing chart below as well: Mon, Nov 9 2015 5:28 pm EST Why should I choose Bamboxers over other brands? We might be a little bit biased, but hear us out. Bamboxers are a great alternative to the mass-produced low-quality brands at many stores. You can also skip the designer brands with their hiked-up pricing and superiority complex. Bamboxers are real underwear for real people. And they’re really comfortable. Mon, Nov 9 2015 2:42 pm EST Where are Bamboxers manufactured? Most of the world’s bamboo is growing in China.  It follows that we are set up to manufacture our fabric, and sew together our skivvies over in China, too.  Zahlen, one of the founders, spent 7 years living in Beijing and working in and around the garment industry.  We’ve visited bamboo farms, and done the rounds of production facilities to find ones we wanted to work with. In cooperation with our in-house Beijing based Bamboxers brethren, we oversee everything from the manufacturing to the finishing touches.  Once we know we have a good pair of undies in hand, we will move them to Seattle, WA for the final shipping to customers. Mon, Nov 9 2015 2:42 pm EST Why is bamboo such a huge deal? Bamboo is awesome because it grows quickly, has high crop yields, uses less water than other crops like cotton, doesn’t need pesticides or other chemicals to grow up big and strong, and it works better wicking away odor and moisture than cotton. Plus, it’s super soft. Mon, Nov 9 2015 2:42 pm EST *Bamboxers for Life. Here’s what we were thinking: You can either get 1 pair of Bamboxers every month for 10 years, OR we can mail you 12 pairs at the beginning of each year to wear at your discretion. Let us know what option floats your boat. Mon, Nov 9 2015 2:42 pm EST ?  ""]",8

Keep in mind that all money raised is going straight to production, so we do not have a current budget for returns. If you are truly unhappy with your reward, and we haven't doubled our goal, we will offer a store credit in exchange for the return of the unworn/undamaged product.  Customer is responsible for return shipping costs. Refund/store credit will NOT include original shipping costs OR the 8-10% fee paid by PonyBabe to Kickstarter.

However, we will have support and input from professors and other members of our universities. Wed, Apr 30 2014 5:14 pm EDT Why these 9 colleges? These 9 universities have well-established and successful science publications whose leaders were interested in this project. As the publication grows, we hope to include undergraduates from more colleges interested in this project.  We are currently sticking with these 9 universities, but every year, we will invite other universities to join us.  If your university is interested in collaborating with us in the future, please send us an email at info@icsjournal.org. Wed, Apr 30 2014 5:18 pm EDT Why online AND print? The website will contain shorter features and breaking science news-type articles, while the print publication will contain longer-form, investigative articles. The website will help us reach a more global audience, but the print publication will be necessary for us to build a real, tangible presence in our university communities. Wed, Apr 30 2014 5:14 pm EDT Why do you need crowd-funding when your universities possess enormous financial resources? There are many reasons we seek crowd-funding, both philosophical and practical. Philosophically: 1. Princeton and Harvard do have large endowments, but the vision for ICSJ is not for it to be an exclusive ivy-league journal. Ideally, ICSJ can expand its membership to any university in the nation, and by relying on Harvard and Princeton\'s endowments, it would make ICSJ an unequal initiative. 2. We are a group of undergraduates whose skills and passions in science communication have been cultivated by our involvement in our respective campus science publications. We have come together due to our roles in our university science publications, but our ultimate goal is to use our shared skills/passions to create an entirely new product that takes science out of academia into the ""real world."" Practically: 3. The universities themselves are not as interested in allocating funds to this initiative, since no one university has ownership over the product. For instance, Princeton is not interested in funding our journal because it is not a ""Princeton club /product"". This journal is beyond a single university\'s scope, so we really do need help from everyone and anyone. 4. Since we want to inform the public about science as objectively as possible, we hope to be supported by a wide variety of donors so that no one donor has complete control over our publication. Relying solely on our respective universities for funding may give these universities some control over what ICSJ publishes. That control runs contrary to the principles of scientific integrity and journalistic independence that we hope ICSJ embodies. That\'s why we\'re turning to the public for funding!

938,704516839,"[' Can you paint hair? Well... technically I CAN... but it never shows up as well as painting on the body. You\'ll notice on several canvases there will be splashes of paint on their hair but most of the time it wasn\'t intentional. It is possible to paint on lighter coloured hair with watercolour paints as it does come out easily, but it is best used in moderation. Plus, there is also hair dye, but that tends to be quite expensive. Sat, Jul 21 2012 2:37 am EDT Are you going to paint an elderly person of a young child? I hope so! I\'m much more likely to paint someone elderly because children tend to be very impatient and as such, asking one to sit still for 45-60 minutes might be a bit much for them. It comes to the person. It all comes down to the request. If they ask me to paint them, or they say yes to being a part of the project I will gladly do it. Sat, Jul 21 2012 2:47 am EDT Are you going to paint a mother and child? I would love to, but again it comes down to practicalities. Plus, it depends how young the child is. I will not paint a new born because there\'s always a chance they could ingest the paints which could be a very serious medical emergency. However, given the opportunity, I will gladly paint any relationship I can get. Sat, Jul 21 2012 2:47 am EDT What made you decide to start this project? I really wanted to find a way to capture the personalities and spirit of the people I met on their skin, so that in the future I could see their picture and immediately know what kind of person they were. Normally body painting is used to cover up a person, or to blend them into an existing painting, whereas my project really wanted to focus on making sure the people involved became the work of art. I wanted them to be the center of attention and to showcase exactly who they were to the rest of the world. Sat, Jul 21 2012 2:47 am EDT What kind of paint do you use? I primarily use acrylic paint. I have used other mediums before but oil is too toxic, and watercolour absorbs into the skin too easily. I am hoping that with this kickstarter I can move to a non-toxic body paint that can be worn for hours on end, but up until now, the paint is never on the skin long enough to absorb or cause any damage. Sat, Jul 21 2012 2:47 am EDT Would you allow me to bring a large bedsheet size of canvas and roll around repeatedly while attempting to mimic safari animal noises and then frame it and put it on etsy for $600.00 as a ""Brad Pitt"" original?

951,1741881277,"[' Why use Kickstarter for this project? We’re going back to our roots! Brotherwise Games owes our existence to our original Boss Monster campaign in 2012. Since then, Boss Monster has become one of the best-selling hobby games of the past decade. We haven’t needed to crowdfund a Boss Monster board game since 2014. But we have a lot of ideas for how to upgrade Overlord with stretch goals, and we want to make sure everyone hears about it. So we’re headed back to Kickstarter on June 16! Tue, Jun 16 2020 9:46 am EDT Is this an all-new game? Yes. Overlord is an entirely new game set in Arcadia, the retro-inspired world of Boss Monster. It’s designed by new people, it’s a different genre of game, and it doesn\'t have some of the hectic ""take that"" elements of Boss Monster. Both games share the theme of controlling a videogame-style villain in a pixel art world. Beyond that, they’re totally unique! Tue, Jun 16 2020 9:46 am EDT What are the core mechanics? Each turn, you’ll draft one tile and one token from the market. To maximize your Power, you’ll need to find the optimal placement for your terrain tiles, monsters, and dungeon entrances!  As you fill your map, use Portals to move your monsters and Crystals to multiply your Power. With smart placement and clever combos, you can build a truly dangerous map. Many Bosses will compete, but only one will be declared the ultimate Overlord! Tue, Jun 16 2020 9:46 am EDT That sounds cool, but what if I want more Boss Monster? We have good news for Boss Monster fans! This October, we’ll also be releasing Vault of Villains, a 64-card “unifying expansion” that allows you to combine any Boss Monster sets you own. Add Minibosses to any big set, add Explorer cards to a Miniboss game, and add tons of new variety to your game. Vault of Villains will be available as an Add-On for the Overlord Kickstarter (at 20% off MSRP), so you can get them both at the same time! Mon, Jul 6 2020 10:45 pm EDT What is Brotherwise doing to make shipping costs more affordable? This is a large, heavy game packed with tiles and tokens. We\'ve done what we can to limit international shipping costs in regions where we have local fulfillment partners: Canada, EU, UK, Australia, and Asia. In other regions, the costs reflect shipping fewer units over a longer distance. But in all regions, Brotherwise Games is subsidizing a portion of shipping costs for every unit. Current shipping costs are our best estimates; final shipping costs will be charged in Backerkit, our pledge manager. If you add additional games in BackerKit, shipping costs will go up based on the actual cost of shipping. Wed, Jul 8 2020 8:13 am EDT How will this campaign handle ""backer exclusive"" content? Based on our experiences with past campaigns, we want to reward backers with special content, but we also want to avoid creating gameplay exclusives that are never available again. With this in mind, we are offering one true ""backer exclusive"" (the Original Backer token bag) that will be inserted (instead of a black bag) in every copy of Overlord pre-ordered through Kickstarter and Backerkit. Our final stretch goals unlocked the Limited Edition bonus pack. This content will not be included in the standard edition of the game. Any content marked ""Limited Edition"" may still be available in the future (at conventions, on BrotherwiseGames.com, and as part of retailer incentive kits) but will not be included in the majority of our print run. Backers get it first, and get it free! Mon, Jul 6 2020 3:26 pm EDT Are there plans to publish non-English language versions of the game? This campaign is for the English-language edition of Overlord. It is likely that Overlord will be translated by some of our publishing partners around the world, such as Pegasus-Spiele in Germany and Asmodee in France. However, they will probably wait to see US sales before making those commitments, so the earliest we might see such a version would be mid-2021. If you\'re planning to play the game with non-English speakers, it\'s worth noting that the game is not very language-dependent. The only English text is on the (optional) Boss cards. Everything else is communicated with numerals and icons. Mon, Jun 29 2020 2:56 pm EDT Can the tile tower fit in the box? Yes! The tile tower from the Tower Edition is flat-packed. It\'s designed to be easily assembled and disassembled between sessions, and there will be room in the box to accommodate it. Mon, Jul 6 2020 10:45 pm EDT How will Add-Ons work? What is the pricing? Add-Ons are added at the same time you pay for shipping, in our BackerKit pledge manager. It will open 1-2 weeks after the end of the campaign, and will allow you to purchase extra copies of the game, the new Vault of Villains expansion for Boss Monster, and more! All Brotherwise Games titles currently in print, as well as some out-of-print Boss Monster card packs, will be available via BackerKit. Pricing will be shared after the campaign closes, but many items will be discounted. For more details about Add-Ons, check out Update #13: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/brotherwise/overlord-a-boss-monster-adventure/posts/2882815 Wed, Jul 8 2020 8:15 am EDT Can I get the market board separately as an Add-On? Yes, you may. The tile tower and market board will each be available in BackerKit as Add-Ons, though the price to get them as a bundle is lower than purchasing them separately. Wed, Jul 8 2020 8:16 am EDT Can I pledge just $1 to gain access to the BackerKit pledge manager? Yes. In BackerKit, you will be able to upgrade your pledge by adding The Game ($40) or the Tower Edition ($55). You can also add other Brotherwise products at that time. However, you may not downgrade your pledge in BackerKit. Wed, Jul 8 2020 8:15 am EDT ?  ']",11

My wife and I have both been committed to raising awareness of CF in general and fundraising for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust since we were thrown into the CF community. Tue, Aug 28 2018 7:31 am EDT Why 47 portraits? There are 47 portraits because 47 is the median predicted survival rate for someone living with Cystic Fibrosis in the UK today. Tue, Aug 28 2018 7:31 am EDT How long did it take you to photography everyone? It took approximately 8 months to visit everyone and shoot all the portraits. Tue, Aug 28 2018 7:31 am EDT How far did you have to travel? Due to risk of cross-infection people with CF can't mix so I wasn't able to simply hire a room and invite people to come to me, I had to go out and visit each subject in their own homes. I covered approximately 1,300 miles. Tue, Aug 28 2018 7:31 am EDT How have you funded the project so far? I've had tangible costs so far - effectively petrol and a few hotel rooms plus intangible costs - several hundred hours of my time - and I've funded these out of my own pocket. The Kickstarter isn't designed to recoup any of those costs - This is a project I'm very passionate about and I've covered the costs out of my own pocket. The Kickstarter is just to cover the costs of the actual printing of the book. Tue, Aug 28 2018 7:31 am EDT Will there be a digital version of the book? At this moment in time I'm not planning to produce a digital version of the book. The focus of the book is the photography and I don't believe a digital book would communicate the final product as well as the printed medium. Tue, Aug 28 2018 7:31 am EDT What will the text be about? The text that accompanies each portrait will be taken from the recording of our conversation during the shoot. It'll be a one or two short paragraphs that give an insight into that individual and their specific situation. In addition there'll be an introduction by me to the project as a whole. Tue, Aug 28 2018 7:31 am EDT You've already beaten your target - what will you use the rest of the money for? We beat the target for this project in just 8 hours which is fantastic.

1154,645370958,"[' Do you perform for schools? Absolutely! Our schools program has been endorsed by both the Virginia Commission for the Arts and the Maryland State Arts Council. We really enjoy introducing these traditions to young folk. Many of them have never heard the music even though they may know they have Irish or Scottish ancestry. When they want to know more about the instruments, music and dance, we know we have planted a seed which can grow into a love of music that will be a lifelong source of comfort and pleasure. Sat, Aug 6 2011 1:42 pm EDT What’s this ‘Pan-Celtic’ stuff all about? We can (& do) talk about this at length! The thumbnail version: The Celts were the ancient tribes that occupied much of Northern Europe before the Romans. They were driven to the western margins (the Iberian Peninsula - Portugal, Galicia & Asturies, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Cornwall, and Brittany) by the Roman, Germanic and Norse invasions, but clung to their languages and culture over the centuries. Each has its own music and cultural influences. The Pan-Celtic movement brings these various traditions together under one rubric. When you mix the tunes together as we do, the differences and similarities start to emerge, bringing the concept of ‘Celtic’ into sharper focus. We’ve pushed the envelope further by including not just the Scottish and Irish traditions of Appalachia and Cape Breton, but also the Celtic elements of Québécois, Cajun and South American music. Fri, Aug 5 2011 11:52 am EDT Do you guys do any original stuff or is it all covers? Well, we play traditional songs and dances which means most of them were composed centuries ago. But they are not ‘covers’ in the sense that we copy someone else’s performance. The arrangements, interpretation, harmonies etc. are entirely our own. In any given set we’ll weave together two or more tunes, usually from different nations, to create a unique original piece of music Fri, Aug 5 2011 11:52 am EDT Why do you play traditional music? All the modern genres of the arts have their roots in older traditions. The traditional music that comes down to us is the best work of thousands of musicians over hundreds of years. All the second rate stuff got filtered out or forgotten along the way. As Celtic artists we have a responsibility to preserve our heritage and pass it along to the next generation so they too can build on it. Just as poems must be read aloud and plays must be performed, traditional music only lives if it is played. Some folk only want to play original music. Some of us choose to focus on the traditional. There’s room for all... Fri, Aug 5 2011 11:53 am EDT Why do you need so much money to make a CD? These days doesn’t everybody do it on a computer in their basement? Certainly a lot can be accomplished in a home setup, but a professional studio offers better acoustics, mics, preamps, software etc. and, most important, the benefit of the ‘ears’ of an experienced sound engineer. We often lay down a dozen or more tracks. Editing and mixing that much requires the right tools. An industry rule of thumb is that every minute of finished music takes an hour of recording and an hour of mixing. For a 55 minute CD that means about $9,000 in studio time. When you add in mastering, artwork, licence fees for any non-traditional material, and the manufacturing cost, the total comes in around $13,500. We’ve spent $8,000 so far which is why we need $5,500 to finish. We waited until the studio work was nearly done so you can be sure the project  really will get completed.

1163,803538016,"[' REWARDS - TIMING: When will all of the rewards be sent out? Of course, like all crowdfunding campaigns (and most docs!), the schedule could always change. We can\'t promise what\'ll happen, but we CAN promise we\'ll work hard to tell you ASAP if/when anything changes. And you\'ll always be able to find our most current estimates at the link above. Fri, Mar 18 2016 2:52 pm EDT REWARDS - SHIPPING: When will you collect shipping charges? Quick answer: We\'ll charge you for shipping after the campaign ends, when you fill out your Reward Order form. Want more details about this, or why we\'re doing it (to save you money!)? Fri, Mar 18 2016 3:11 pm EDT REWARDS - T-SHIRT: What sizes are available? How will you know what size I want? There are always LOTS of shirt-related questions, and we\'ve got answers to most of them. Fri, Mar 18 2016 3:11 pm EDT CAMPAIGN - Why doesn\'t your Kickstarter actually say ""FUCK"" in the title? RIGHT?! This is one of the best, most important questions you can ask! Basically, because most of the online platforms won\'t allow us to use it... but don\'t worry, it\'s not the name of the MOVIE... it\'s just the name of the Kickstarter campaign. Fri, Mar 18 2016 3:11 pm EDT CAMPAIGN - Are members of the Zappa family involved? This one is really important too. Before she passed, Gail Zappa, and the Zappa Family Trust (ZFT), gave me permission to make this movie, and with it, full access to include ANYTHING in Frank\'s private archives (""the Vault""). But the Zappas do NOT get creative control or approvals over the finished film, which is important to me. Otherwise, it wouldn\'t be an objective doc. It would be a commissioned puff-piece. Fri, Mar 18 2016 3:11 pm EDT CAMPAIGN - Why are you crowdfunding this project? There are a few big reasons, but the biggest are that: (a) I think a lot of Zappa fans will be excited, just like I am, at this chance to peek inside the Vault, and to save/preserve a lot of the historical (but less commercial) stuff Frank saved, and (b) I think Frank would have been totally into crowdfunding, since it lets artists keep a lot more creative freedom. Fri, Mar 18 2016 3:11 pm EDT REWARDS - Will backers see/receive the finished doc before anyone else? Quick answer: that depends on a lot of factors, and I don\'t control all of those. But I WANT backers to see the movie first, even if we do a live online preview screening. I can\'t promise you\'ll get your downloads or DVDs before they go on sale, but I CAN promise I\'d like you to, and I\'ll do my best to make that happen, if it doesn\'t keep us from getting distributed. Fri, Mar 18 2016 3:11 pm EDT THE MOVIE - Aren\'t there a bunch of other Frank Zappa documentaries already? Fri, Mar 18 2016 3:11 pm EDT THE VAULT - If we save the Vault, who owns the stuff in it? Quick answer: whatever we save and digitize from the Vault will still belong to the Zappa Family Trust, but we\'ll have full permission to include ANY of what we find in the final doc, and the companion book, and I\'ll be able to share a bunch of clips and highlights with you as part of the DIGITAL VAULT PASS reward (TRACK 25+). Fri, Mar 18 2016 3:11 pm EDT THE VAULT - Why aren\'t the Zappas saving the Vault on their own? Quick answer: they\'ve been working for decades already to save and release as much material as they can, but it\'s a MUCH bigger job than most people can imagine. It takes a TON of time and money, and by the time they\'re able to get around to all of it (especially the less commercial stuff), it might be too old/damaged to fully restore and preserve. And I don\'t think I\'m the only Zappa fan who likes the idea of helping save more stuff, and getting to see more of what\'s hiding in there, so I think it works out for everyone. Fri, Mar 18 2016 3:11 pm EDT THE VAULT - What happens to the Vault if we don\'t raise enough? Will it all be lost? Quick answer: FUCK NO. The ZFT will continue working to save as much as they can on their own, and will probably continue releasing it on new albums. But we have a chance to save a lot more stuff, right now, and get access to it for the doc, the book, and the Digital Vault Pass. Fri, Mar 18 2016 3:11 pm EDT THE VAULT - How are you going to preserve and archive everything? Is Joe Travers involved? Oh man, such a great question. The quick answer: yes, Joe ""Vaultmeister"" Travers will continue to oversee ALL efforts to preserve and save material from the Vault, but with the funds we raise, we\'ll be able to help him expand and save more... especially some of the really interesting, but less commercial, material about Frank\'s life. I\'ve been learning a ton about the complexities of preserving and archiving, but I\'ll never know as much as Joe. (No one will!) So, I asked him if he could write a little bit about what\'s involved, and he sent me a detailed answer. Fri, Mar 18 2016 3:11 pm EDT BONUS REWARDS - How do I get my ZAPPA FOR PRESIDENT stickers? How will you know I voted? Fri, Mar 18 2016 3:15 pm EDT THE ZAPPAS - Why aren\'t the Zappas paying for this doc themselves? Quick answer: because it\'s important that this movie be objective and unbiased. The ZFT approved us making it, but have no creative control or approval over the final edit.

If you are pledging for a level that doesn\'t already include the TPB editions of TALES OF MR. RHEE Volumes 1 and 2 (such as ""Gimme Everything"" or ""Comics and Coffee"") but want the first two books in the series as well, add $25 to your pledge and, at the end of the campaign, you\'ll be able to add both books to your pledge at a special discounted ""bundle"" price. How\'s that for service? Sun, May 1 2016 11:39 pm EDT Can I add-on an extra Hardcover, T-shirt, mug, etc to my pledge? ABSOLUTELY! If you\'d like to add an extra item to your existing pledge level, just adjust your pledge to include the price for the item you want as per the list below. At the end of the campaign you will get access to a ""BackerKit"" where we\'ll offer backers a chance to choose any additional ""add-ons"" they want that weren\'t part of his/her original pledge. Just make sure to add the funds to your pledge BEFORE the campaign ends, though, as funds added after the campaign ends don\'t count towards the Stretch Goals! Here\'s the guideline for the add-on items: ORIGINAL ART COMMISSION: + $50 (Limit One) WRITE OR WRONG softcover book: + $15 each Mon, May 2 2016 6:19 pm EDT I\'m interested in the ""Convention Royalty"" pledge... but karaoke scares me. And I\'m lactose intolerant. My friends, if you pledge to be ""Convention Royalty"" that means you will be the King/Queen of the Convention for a day (or evening). If you don\'t want to go karaoke after dinner, we won\'t. If you don\'t like ice cream... I\'ll eat yours. (Kidding... mostly.) Pledging at this level gets you a dinner and chat-time that YOU want, so once we determine the convention or signing appearance that works for you (my convention schedule is routinely being updated at www.DirkManning.com and via my mailing list, which you can subscribe to from the front page), we\'ll pick a place to eat and chat about comics, horror movies, heavy metal, wrestling, writing, and whatever else tickles your fancy (within the confines of reason and legality) over a nice meal that will be right for you! Thu, Apr 28 2016 9:45 am EDT I\'m interested in the ""Convention Royalty"" pledge... but are you really serious about the karaoke part? Because that kind of excites me... Am I serious about the karaoke? You watch this video, then you tell me: https://youtu.be/SjR0WCKv7GM Thu, Apr 28 2016 9:47 am EDT I have TALES OF MR. RHEE... but not Volume 2. What\'s the easiest way to add Volume 2 to my pledge? If you want to add TALES OF MR. RHEE Volume 2 (only) to your pledge, just add $15 to your pledge. Then, at the end of the campaign, you\'ll be able to add it to your rewards... meaning you\'re all caught-up just like that! (As mentioned elsewhere in the FAQ, if you want to add TPB editions of TALES OF MR. RHEE Volumes 2 and 3, you can add them both for the special bundled/discount price of $25, because, hey, we\'re happy to help you get it all!) Sun, May 1 2016 11:39 pm EDT Is there a way I can get Hardcover Editions of TALES OF MR. RHEE Volumes 1 and 2? Regarding Volumes 1 and 2 in Hardcover format, the way we run each campaign, each volume of TALES OF MR. RHEE has been offered in Hardcover only once during the initial campaign for 30 days -- and then made print-to-order. Given this, unfortunately, we do not have any hardcover editions of TALES OF MR. RHEE Volume 1 or 2 to offer. That being said, I recognize that some of you out there would really like to jump into the series with ""matching format"" of all three books (so far), and if that\'s the case I\'d recommend grabbing TPB copies of Volumes 1 and 2 through this campaign (or your local comic shop, or Amazon) so you have them to read, and then keeping an eye out in the secondary market (aka: Ebay or Amazon) to see if one turns-up. Honestly, folks, we pretty much print the HC editions to order, so it\'s not even like I have stacks of them squirreled away to send you. If you like having limited edition Hardcovers, though, get the Volume 3 edition while you can through this campaign... because, as evidenced above, once the campaign ends, we print to order and they\'re GONE! Sun, May 1 2016 11:39 pm EDT I enjoy digital comics. Is there a way to get digital copies of TALES OF MR. RHEE Volumes 1 and 2 as well? Absolutely! Just add $10 to your pledge for each additional volume you\'d like, and we\'ll hook you up. That means for $30 total you\'ll get all three volumes of TALES OF MR. RHEE in glorious PDF formats to enjoy on your e-RHEEding device of choice. Thanks for asking... and happy reading! Thu, May 12 2016 12:52 am EDT ?  ']",7

1239,418562039,"[' What is online harassment? Mon, Apr 20 2015 10:11 am EDT Who experiences online harassment? According to a Pew Research Center survey from late last year, 40% of people have been harassed online and 73% of people witnessed someone else being harassed online. We know that many folks, from all walks of life, experience and even perpetuate online harassment. However, when it comes to threats, women, people of color, and LGBTQ folks are disproportionately impacted. Of the 3,787 people who reported harassing incidents from 2000 to 2012 to the volunteer organization Working to Halt Online Abuse, 72.5 percent were female. A national study of middle and high school students found that 45 percent of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth who experienced cyber harassment felt depressed and more than 25 percent wrestled with suicidal thoughts. Mon, Apr 20 2015 10:12 am EDT Why is Hollaback! the right fit for taking on online harassment? Hollaback! has ten years of experience addressing sexual harassment in public space through reporting, bystander intervention, and online movement building. As a result of our work, we’ve been awarded the Ted City 2.0 prize, Manhattan Young Democrats “Engendering Progress” award, and been named one of CNN’s Top Safety Apps. We have collected over 8,000 stories of street harassment from individuals all over the world, while providing resources and support. We’re expanding our mission to include online harassment with the launch of HeartMob. In 2014, we took on a leadership role in the online harassment movement by founding, leading and managing an extensive Online Harassment Task Force, including over 70 leaders in the field. During the development of HeartMob, the Online Harassment Task Force served as experts on what victims of online harassment face, and what interventions would help them feel safer and supported online. These suggested interventions formed the core of the HeartMob prototype, which began development in August 2014 and finalized in January 2014. In December 2014, we held the first summit on online harassment in NYC. During the summit, we used human centered design principles to test the HeartMob prototype with key journalists and organizational leaders from the Online Harassment Task Force. Moving forward, we have secured a development team, a legal team, a research team, and we are committed to leveraging Hollaback!’s robust network to make this project successful. Sassafras Tech Collective (http://sassafras.coop) is developing the HeartMob platform and providing necessary updates. They are a worker-owned technology cooperative specializing in web/app design and development for nonprofits. The collective brings expertise from industry, academia, and social justice organizing, alongside extensive professional backgrounds in code and design. Tue, Apr 21 2015 11:47 am EDT How will you make the platform secure for users? We take the security and privacy of Heartmobbers very seriously. The last thing we want is for someone to be harassed as a result of using HeartMob. As a result, HeartMob will implement social and technical security best practices. These practices will include: Mon, Apr 27 2015 11:41 am EDT What will you do if you raise over $10,000 on the project? $10,000 covers initial tech development on the HeartMob platform -- but we have a long way to go. Any additional funding will go into further development of the platform. We will provide updates throughout the campaign and strive for transparency. Mon, Apr 20 2015 10:12 am EDT Is my donation tax-deductible? Yes. Hollaback! is a 501(c)3 organization. Mon, Apr 20 2015 10:12 am EDT Where can I find more information about Hollaback!?

Kickstarter is powered by a unique all-or-nothing funding method where projects must be fully funded or no money changes hands. If funding fails, all pledges are canceled and that's that. Your card is not charged. Once I reach my goal and the project finishes I’ll get to work on your rewards. Mon, Jun 8 2015 3:04 pm EDT How Do I Make a Pledge? Just click the green “Back This Project” button in the upper right-hand corner. You will be asked to input your pledge amount and select a reward. From there, you will go through the checkout process. It’s fast and simple. Mon, Jun 8 2015 3:11 pm EDT Can You Exceed Your Campaign Goal? Yes, and it would be so awesome to do so! I have listed here a bare necessity budget. I am starting with $5,500 on Kickstarter because I think with the all-or-nothing approach I can raise that amount. But, honestly, I have chosen this platform to pre-sale the album as I want to spread the word about this music as far and wide as possible so people will be listening to it! Mon, Jun 8 2015 3:11 pm EDT Can I Increase My Pledge Once It’s Been Made? YES! Once you donate to my campaign, you may want to change your incentive reward to a different one, or increase your pledge amount. To do so, go to Kickstarter and sign in. If you go to my campaign page, the green “Back This Project” button has been replaced with a blue “Manage Your Donation” button. Click it and you can enter a new amount, or choose a new incentive.

Tue, Jan 23 2018 7:30 pm EST Is the poster the instructions? Yes the poster is the instructions. It’s printed on a special handmade Japanese paper and works well as artwork for your wall. Tue, Jan 23 2018 7:30 pm EST Should I frame my print? It’s always a good idea to frame a print to keep it safe. That being said I have some Japanese paper prints which I hang on my wall bare so it’s not necessary. Tue, Jan 23 2018 7:30 pm EST Tell me more about this handmade paper? Traditional Japanese paper–known as Washi–is made from the fibres of plants. It has some interesting properties. It’s light, strong and feels a bit like cloth. Kozo paper is made from the inner layers of the mulberry bush. The branches of the bush are trimmed, cleaned and stretched and are then pounded into a paste. After that, the paste is laid out flat in thin sheets and dried. There’s a lot more to the process. If you want to learn more I suggest visiting the Japanese Paper Place’s website: http://bit.ly/2F5hP9U Tue, Jan 23 2018 7:30 pm EST Is shipping included?

The more support we receive the more communities we can responsibly cover, such as Highland Park, Deerfield, Glenview, Northbrook, Skokie, Lake Forest and others.

Mon, Jul 13 2020 3:15 pm EDT What will be the cost of a subscription to The Record North Shore? We are still finalizing the rate, but the monthly price will be around $7 a month with a discount for a yearly subscription.

1474,1433957105,"[' Aren’t there already a lot of books about album cover art on the market? Yes, there are. I have several dozen of them in my collection, and I list more of them on the ACHOF site. A lot of time has been spent cataloging album cover art, but very little time has been spent introducing the people that made it and letting you learn more about them, their careers, their inspirations, etc. Thu, Apr 5 2018 11:59 am EDT Why are you turning to crowd-funding for this project? There are a few reasons, but the biggest are that: (a) I think a lot of album cover art fans will be excited to read the stories both about some of their favorite album covers and the people that made them and (b) I thought this might be a great opportunity to offer some of the many prints I saved from my gallery as incentives to fans and collectors of album art (it seemed a shame that they were just sitting in archive boxes, rather than hung up on the walls of album art fans). Since I owned them outright and bought them a number of years ago, I am also able to offer them at less-than-market prices – all the more incentive to support this project, I think! Thu, Apr 5 2018 11:59 am EDT When will the rewards be shipped out? Of course, like all crowd-funding campaigns, the schedule can perhaps change. Of course, since I’ve already completed 90% of the writing and editing and have the art prints in stock, I’m feeling pretty confident that I’ll be able to ship out the art print rewards soon after the project is funded, with the book following in a few months (gunning for an August, 2018 ship date – in plenty of time for Holiday gift-giving, if that’s your hope). While I can\'t promise what\'ll happen exactly,what I  CAN promise is that we\'ll work hard to tell you ASAP if/when anything changes. And you\'ll always be able to find our most current estimates via the link to the ACHOF Rewards page - https://wp.me/P15kTT-wW Thu, Apr 5 2018 11:59 am EDT About those shipping charges… I\'m doing my best to keep these reasonable and to a minimum for you. The book will weigh nearly 4lbs. and measure at least 9"" square, so it should fit into some of the standard mailing envelopes and boxes I\'ve used. I prefer to use the USPS for shipping as they offer both package tracking and insurance - very helpful on shipments both here in the U.S. and overseas. Overseas customers - I have to apologize in advance for the added costs for shipping. They\'ve gone up rather dramatically over the past couple of years, and there aren\'t as many options as there used to be, so I can only hope that it doesn\'t dissuade you from supporting me at this point. If you\'re supporting me at the higher levels, please note that your prints and books will be shipped separately in packaging that will keep your products safe. These cost a bit more, but they\'re worth it - trust me, after shipping thousands of prints to customers around the world when I had my gallery, I\'ve learned (the hard way) that careful package prep and quality containers are the ONLY way to ship to customers - at least those you want to keep happy! Thu, Apr 5 2018 11:59 am EDT Will Kickstarter supporters be the first to get this book? I chose to offer the first edition of my book to my Kickstarter supporters as I felt that a crowd-funding project would be the best way to both get me focused on (finally) writing and producing this book and offer my long-time supporters something special. I’ve written and collected so much content – over 1000 pages so far – that I could offer an even bigger/more-comprehensive book, but I didn’t want to produce such an enormous book – and sell it at an exorbitant price – so I’m choosing what I feel is a great deal of compelling content and, if the first edition is successful, I’d hope to bring out either/both a second book with more stories and/or that 1000+ page compendium later on. Of course, it goes without saying that I’m hoping to offer a version of this book to publishers who might want to publish it in a more “traditional” way, but I’ll entertain that if/when those offers appear AFTER the first “collector’s edition” is printed and shipped to supporters.

I use the term alt-right when I\'m talking to people about what I do for the first time because it\'s a term they\'re at least somewhat familiar with. My goal is to help people understand what the so-called alt-right is, who they\'re aligned with, how ugly their beliefs are, and why they\'re a dangerous political and cultural force. I try to avoid using the term in my newsletter. I\'ll often refer to them as the so-called alt-right or the Frog Squad.

BONUS PRINT NUMBERING DETAILS (FIRST RELEASE ONLY) A couple of days ago I posted a 'pending' explanation on how the numbering will work on the Bonus Prints. I'm pleased to say that we've got it figured out now and this is how it will be done (in addition to the gold foil seal). There will be two sets of numbering: Bonus Print Numbering - Dave will hand letter a sequence number of your FIRST RELEASE Bonus Plates that will numbered as 1 of x, 2 of x, 3 of x, etc all the way up to x of x (Calculus anyone??) where the variable x will be replaced with the total number of Bonus Prints of that particular version produced. So, for example, if 24 backers selected BP #4 then x = 24 for BP #4. Similarly, if 35 backers selected BP #9, then x= 35 and so on. Each BP will have it's own 'x' value. If you pledged for a Headsketch in CANO, this will be done in a similar way, except for Dave hand lettering the numbers this time. Portfolio Numbering - This will be your reservation number (which becomes a registration number once printed) out of y where y = total number of portfolios printed (just like the __ of 300 we did for CANO). This connects your Bonus Prints to your portfolio number and the master registration number record will show this. Signature - Dave will sign every Bonus Print John Funk Sat, Oct 25 2014 7:30 pm EDT ?  ""]",2

トモヤはいまだに心的外傷後ストレス障害（PTSD）の症状に苦しんでいると言っています。「ぼくのこわれないコンパス」の撮影を通して、トモヤは心の傷を少しでも癒すことができましたか？または、自分の過去をさらけ出すことにより、彼の心の傷はより深いものとなりましたか？ トモヤとの撮影を始める前に、私たちにとって最も重要な課題は、彼が今人生のどの段階にいるのかをよく理解することでした。トモヤが映画の制作チームに安心して自身の経験を打ち明けることができ、公の場で自分の生い立ちについてオープンに話すことができる、強い精神状態にある必要がありました。 私たちが気付かないところでトモヤの精神状態を悪化させたり、まだ向き合う準備ができていない過去の出来事に触れることで、より彼の心を傷つけたりするのは、あってはならないことだったからです。 トモヤは恥ずかしがり屋なところもありますが、自分の生い立ちについては、とても率直に自信を持って話してくれました。 私たちはトモヤの心の状態をこれからも定期的に確認するため、彼との連絡を取り続ける予定です。この映画のメッセージを広める上でトモヤを全面的に支援し、今後必要とされる心のケアやあらゆるサポートを行い続けていきたいと思っています。 Sun, Sep 1 2019 10:47 pm EDT トモヤはどのようにしてこのドキュメンタリー映画に関わるようになったのですか？ マット・ミラー監督は、2つのNPO団体「みらいの森」と「リビングドリームス」との関わりを通して、4～5年前にトモヤと出会いました。「みらいの森」が企画した様々なキャンプやプログラムに、ミラー監督がボランティアとして参加した際に、トモヤもリーダー実習生として参加していました。また同様に、「リビングドリームス」のプログラムでも、ミラー監督はトモヤを見かけるようになりました。 そのうち、高校を卒業して一人暮らしをしていたトモヤは、ミラー監督が制作していたドキュメンタリーに出る可能性について、考えるようになりました。 トモヤは、児童養護施設での自身の経験を話すことは、とても大切なことであると強く感じていました。トモヤにとって児童養護施設はたくさんの良い思い出が詰まった場所であるにも関わらず、メディアは施設の否定的な側面しか映し出していないように彼は感じていました。多くの人が聞いたことのある施設のイメージとは違う、新しい視点をもたらしたいとトモヤは思っていたのです。 Sun, Sep 1 2019 10:47 pm EDT 「ぼくのこわれないコンパス」に出てくる児童養護施設は、どうして施設名が表示されていないのですか？ 児童養護施設の名前や所在地は、インターネット上で公開されています。このドキュメンタリー映画において、特定の施設に焦点を当てる必要性がないため、施設名は明示しないことにしました。また、撮影は複数の施設で行われており、特定の施設が不必要に注目を浴びることのないよう、映画の中では様々な施設で撮られた映像を混ぜて使用しています。 Sun, Sep 1 2019 10:47 pm EDT 「ぼくのこわれないコンパス」の中で子どもたちの顔が映されていないのは、どうしてですか？ 児童養護施設で暮らす子どもたちは、それぞれ異なる事情を持ち、複雑な環境に置かれていて、その状況に対する明確な答えが必ずしもある訳ではありません。 「ぼくのこわれないコンパス」に映っている子どもたちのほとんどが小学生です。彼らが学校でいじめられたり差別的な扱いを受けたりすることのないよう、また、親から身を隠している子どもたちの居場所が特定されないよう、プライバシーを尊重して子どもたちの顔は映していません。 Sun, Sep 1 2019 10:47 pm EDT この「よくある質問」のページに記載されていない内容について聞きたいことがあるのですが、メッセージしても良いですか？ A.  ご質問があれば、遠慮なくいつでもメッセージをお送りください。 Sun, Sep 1 2019 10:47 pm EDT 「エグゼクティブ・プロデューサー」として支援をすると、リワード（出資への見返り）として、どのようなプライベートパーティーに参加することができますか？ 「エグゼクティブ・プロデューサー」レベルでご支援いただける場合は、「ぼくのこわれないコンパス」制作チームの一員としての扱いを受けることができます。またプライベートパーティーに関しては、直接メッセージをいただければ、詳細の情報をお送り差し上げます。 Sun, Sep 1 2019 10:47 pm EDT ヘリコプターツアーの長さは何時間ですか？また、ツアーはどの会社を通して行われますか？ プロジェクトをご支援される前に、まずは直接メッセージをお送りいただき、ご希望の場所をお知らせいただけましたら、ツアーに関する詳細を事前にお送り差し上げます。 Sun, Sep 1 2019 10:47 pm EDT

誰が「ぼくのこわれないコンパス」の制作に携わっていますか？ 8月初頭に、ドキュメンタリー制作に携わったメンバーの名前、写真、短い紹介文を公式ウェブサイトに掲載する予定です Sun, Sep 1 2019 10:47 pm EDT Kickstarterは安全なウェブサイトですか？Kickstarterを初めて使用します。

最終的にプロジェクトの目標金額に満たない場合、私のプレッジ（支援を約束するための寄付金）はどうなりますか？ 目標金額に満たない場合は、寄付いただいた金額を請求されることはありません。 Sun, Sep 1 2019 10:47 pm EDT これまでどこで「ぼくのこわれないコンパス」の撮影は行われてきましたか？ 東京都、神奈川県、千葉県、新潟県、長野県、栃木県、茨城県、宮城県、岩手県、福島県で、撮影が行われてきました。 Sun, Sep 1 2019 10:47 pm EDT When do I get my 100% off coupon to pick any pair of KEEN Footwear I want?

Mon, Oct 1 2018 6:15 pm EDT Why did you release these out of order? Technically, I didn\'t. Originally, this was a 600-page graphic novel but that would be impossible to print. The cost was way too high. I thought it would be cool to break them up. I wanted to start with OII because I thought it would be intriguing to read through this story a bit confused as to what\'s going on. And, over time, start to understand. Plus, there is a part of the story that needed to be separated (OI) from the rest of the story. Something that some may discover. A connection between certain characters that is better discovered out of sequence. That\'s my hope at least. Mon, Oct 1 2018 6:15 pm EDT Will these books be available after the Kickstarter is over?

To photograph something that doesn’t move, such as on land, by day, by holding a smartphone camera up to the eyepiece: Yes.  Nifty little holders for this are advertised online.  Every few months there’s an improved version. To photograph the Moon at night, with that same smartphone holder: Yes. To photograph other celestial objects, but you don’t use or understand an “equatorial mounting” with a “clock drive” to compensate “right ascension”: No.  Celestial objects are so faint that you need a time-exposure to collect enough light.  But Earth’s rotation makes them appear to move in arcs across the sky.  Magnifying the objects with a telescope also magnifies their motion.  While you’re taking the time-exposure, motion blurs the image horribly. To photograph celestial objects, and you use and understand your equatorial mounting and clock drive, and right ascension: Yes.  Attach our “Optical Tube Assembly” model (f/4.2) to your mounting or to a telescope already on that mounting.  Follow all the procedures for astrophotography.  That’s how glorious astronomical images are taken.  Alert: This is very tricky!  Many things can go wrong and ruin most attempts.  Talk it over with experienced astrophotographers.  If you have the skills, patience, attitude, and personality for it, proceed. Sun, Apr 24 2016 5:01 pm EDT Can You Use Other Eyepieces in Bright-Eye? Yes.

1667,1300954799,"[' Rewards: Can I pledge for more than one reward level? Unfortunately, Kickstarter doesn’t allow pledges for more that one reward. However, if you want multiple items, simply add the cost of the extra item to your pledge (please refer to the Add-on topic following). After the campaign finishes, we will send out a survey where you can confirm your extra items. Wed, Feb 26 2020 8:00 pm EST Add-on: How do I add more item(s) to my pledge? 1: If you’ve already pledged to this project, click the “Manage My Pledge” button at the top of the page. If not, click “Back this project” and pick one of the rewards. Every backer can pick one and only one reward level. 2. Look at the Add-On Menu in the project description. Find the item(s) you want to add. Then increase your reward by the corresponding dollar amount. For example, if you choose a reward level of Maco Go ($22), and would like to add an extra  Maco Go ($20) and an extra USB-A adapter ($5). Total pledge = $22 + $20 + $5 = $47 (adjust your pledge from $22 to $47.) The shipping is ONE flat fee of $10~$15 AUD depending on your location - no matter how many items you get. 3. Done, you can sit back and relax. After the project ended, we will send you a survey to ask you for shipping information, which items (if any) you added from the Add-on Menu and also confirm your color selection. You will also have the chance to add any Maco products later on in the survey. Wed, Feb 26 2020 8:00 pm EST Rewards: I want to add a Maco product(e.g. Maco cable organiser) to my pledge, how can I do it? If the Maco product is listed at the Add-on menu in the project description, you can just simply adjust your pledge amount by adding the discounted price of the specific item you would like to add on top of your original reward. If the Maco product is not listed at the Add-on menu in the project description, do not worry. After the campaign ends, we will send every backer a survey where you will be able to add on any additional Maco product(s) you want that is not available on the Add-On Menu. Our other Maco products can be found at hellomaco.com Wed, Feb 26 2020 8:00 pm EST Product: What is the dimension and weight of Maco Go? The dimension of Maco Go is 32 x 42 x 10mm / 1.2 x 1.6 x 0.4inch. The weight is 20g / 0.04lbs. An illustration can be found under the Specifications on the campaign page. Wed, Feb 26 2020 8:00 pm EST Products: Will there be more colours for Maco Go? We’re always open to adding more colours. However, adding other (colour) options does become tricky with our manufacturing (minimum order quantity), and inventory management side of things. We’ll consider introducing more colours as the campaign progresses. Wed, Feb 26 2020 8:00 pm EST What devices are compatible with Maco Go? We also offer an option USB-A adapter which allows you to charge with any device or power adapter with the USB-A adapter. Wed, Feb 26 2020 8:00 pm EST Shipping: When will I receive my reward? We aim to have manufacturing completed in July 2020, and send stock to our fulfillment centers (Melbourne & Hong Kong). We hope to start shipping rewards by the end of July 2020. We will keep all of our backers updated and be completely transparent with progress. Wed, Feb 26 2020 8:00 pm EST Shipping: What shipping method will you be using? Wed, Feb 26 2020 8:00 pm EST Shipping: How much is the shipping fee? Shipping is a standard flat fee of AUD $10 for Australia, and AUD $12-15 for the rest of the world. There is no added shipping fee for any additional item you add to your reward. Wed, Feb 26 2020 8:00 pm EST Return: What is your return / refund policy? Unfortunately, we do not offer refunds or returns on items received as Kickstarter rewards. The items you receive after making a pledge is not a purchase but are referred to as ‘rewards’. The item is more of a gift to you as a sign of our appreciation to you for supporting our campaign and business. If the item/s you received is faulty, we are more than happy to send a replacement item/part, and we do have a two-year warranty on all our products. Wed, Feb 26 2020 8:00 pm EST Warranty: Do you have a warranty for Maco Go? Yes. We have a two-year warranty on all our products. If any product becomes defective, we will replace it free of charge. Wed, Feb 26 2020 8:00 pm EST I have another question? Please message us directly through Kickstarter or via our email: info@hellomaco.com, we’d be more than happy to answer any questions.

Tue, Aug 13 2019 6:13 pm EDT What is our philosophy? We value quality ingredients that are expertly grown and thoughtfully sourced. For us, the tea is always the hero and cold brewing is the way we showcase all the nuanced flavours the leaf has to offer. We love to source local when possible – our black tea is grown in far North Queensland near Wooroonooran National Park, and we flavour our beverages with real fruit – never added sugar. Tue, Aug 13 2019 6:13 pm EDT Why is our product in cans? We’ve also put a lot of time and consideration into our packaging –  a slimline aluminium can – which makes our brews convenient for the consumer, with minimal impact on the planet.

Kickstarter is full of ambitious, innovative, and imaginative ideas that are brought to life through the direct support of others. Everything on Kickstarter must be a project with a clear goal, like making an album, a book, or a work of art. A project will eventually be completed, and something will be produced by it. In our case, we produce activewear from ocean pollution. Wed, Oct 14 2020 12:13 pm EDT What is crowdfunding? Crowdfunding is a way for creators to raise funds to bring ideas to life, typically where a large number of people 'pledge' a small amount of money in return for a reward or gift. Wed, Oct 14 2020 12:15 pm EDT Cancellation policy If for any reason you decide to change your mind on your order during this campaign, you are able to cancel and receive a full refund, no questions asked. Unfortunately we can't accept returns after the rewards have been shipped to you, but \u2028sizing exchanges will be available within 15 days of receiving your reward, provided we have your alternative size in stock. You'll only have to cover the costs of the return shipping and we'll take care of the fees in sending you the correct size. Orders from 'backers' are not real 'purchases' per se, but rather as contributions in exchange for 'rewards’ in return for believing in and funding the project. The support we get from our Kickstarter backers is what enables us to run and grow our business, gather customer feedback, design new products, and improve existing ones. That is why refunds of contributions are not available for our campaign on this platform. Fri, Oct 16 2020 6:24 am EDT How do I tell you my size? That's easy.

So no need to specify at the time of your pledge :) Tue, Oct 20 2020 5:15 am EDT When will I be charged? When you make a pledge to our campaign you are effectively securing your backing and your card details are taken to do this, but we don't charge you at that time. After the campaign has been successfully funded we'll confirm all of your order requirements in the post-campaign survey and at the point your card will be charged.

Will they lose their position or come off if I bump my tracker? The magnets are actually quite good at holding their position. We did multiple tests to see how well they hold including shaking the tracker vigorously back and forth, tapping it on a table on its edge, and lightly dragging fingers across the magnets. They held position in all tests and are unlikely to come lose from regular use. Tue, Dec 1 2020 11:26 am EST What happens if I lose some of my magnets?

I\'ve already massively streamlined the rules text from the first edition, and I\'d like to keep it as concise as possible so there\'s less you have to read before you play. Thu, Sep 24 2020 7:56 pm EDT Is Kingdom easy to play online? Definitely. I\'ve played about 30 sessions online and it works great. All you need is a shared text document and video or audio chat. Nothing complicated. Thu, Sep 24 2020 7:54 am EDT Is Kingdom like Microscope? No, Kingdom is a very different game. The new Kingdom Legacy option jumps back and forth between different time periods, which is conceptually more like Microscope, but it plays entirely differently. Thu, Sep 24 2020 7:50 am EDT Will you be offering add-ons of your other games, like Microscope or Follow? UPDATE: Add-ons are now available. Click ""manage my pledge"" to add items. Each book adds only $3 international shipping (or $1 in the US), so international backers particularly can save by getting multiple books at once. Kickstarter won\'t let you add books if you selected a reward level with no shipping, such as a PDF. Change to a reward level that includes shipping and you can add more books.

Here's a breakdown of my estimated costs to help clarify: Cost of Video editing ~$300 Cost of Video shooting ~GIFT! (Thank you SteadyFly Productions, you're a great friend!) Thu, Dec 10 2015 10:09 am EST Why does printing cost so much? Okay, you now have a better understanding of the costs of attending the Show, and you're wondering why the printing cost is so high. Great question. Letterpressed stationery is called handmade for a reason. Many hands are involved in the process. 1) The Designer - I draw the designs whether by hand or directly on my computer and submit vector files to the printer. 2) The Printer - Once my printer has files in hand (or technically in email), he or she will review the files to make sure everything is formatted properly and then send them off to the die maker. He or she also orders the paper at this time (Paper manufacturing is an entire process unto itself). 3) The Die Maker - Using computer-automated machinery, my design is laser-etched into a piece of copper. 4) The Printer - Once my printer receives the plates, it's time to set up the press. This involves mixing the ink (by hand) to the specified color and making sure the plate is aligned properly on the press. This is called registration. Registration is very important, especially when more than one color is involved, because you want to make sure the images align just right (each color in letterpress and foil stamping requires its own plate and the press must be cleaned every time a color is changed). Once the plate is registered, the color mixed, and the impression set (how hard the plate gets pushed into the paper), the cards are ready to be made. All of that for one card. Multiply that by the number of pieces and then the number of colors. When you receive a letterpressed card is like receiving a mini work of art. Thu, Dec 10 2015 10:32 am EST ?  ""]",3

The Membrane microfilter is a long term technology and should only need to be replaced once per year.  If after a year the flow rate of the filter is still good, you do not need to replace it until you notice significant slowing of the flow rate.  This filter can never be rendered ineffective, it will only stop filtering. Indicators for replacements for the Activated Carbon and Ion Exchange Filter: In general, concentration of heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury, Cadmium, Chromium, etc. in tap/ground water (excluding sewage, industrial waste water) is only in ppb level (part per billion) and is extremely low compared with concentration of normal minerals such as Potassium, Calcium, Magnesium, etc. in the same source of water which is in ppm level (part per million) Our activated carbon fiber and ion exchange filter is specifically designed to selectively remove heavy metals while keeps healthy minerals in the water through a complex process: physical adsorption resulting from Van der Waals forces and chemical adsorption where chemical bonds are formed to trap heavy metals in the porous and high surface area of the adsorbent material. In theory, this process can reduce TDS in the water but only in µg/L level which cannot be detected by a normal reading when taking into account the deviation of TDS in raw water (e.g city tap water), accuracy/repeatability of TDS meter & measuring operation. In general, we caution against the use of TDS as a measure of efficacy and you can read more about why on our recent blog post: https://www.lifestraw.com/blogs/news/do-you-know-what-s-in-your-tap-water Developing an accurate lifetime indicator has been a common challenge for the industry - certainly one that we acknowledge and will be working to address.  But as noted, we feel that TDS is probably not the long-term answer. Wed, Mar 20 2019 1:15 pm EDT ?  ']",6

For Bulgaria choose Romania for shipping. For New Zealand choose Australia.  Things are sorted out in the pledge manager. Fri, Jan 22 2021 1:26 pm EST What are the differences between the Deluxe Edition and the Regular edition? The differences between both editions are the inlay created by Game Trayz, the department board, better quality components, components which are designed exclusively for this edition and the extra department and donation tiles in the box at no cost. You can also check the ""What\'s in the box"" and ""Stretch Goals"" sections to see what\'s all been added thanks to the support of our backers. Another important distinction: this Deluxe edition will not be produced for retail alter one, and Quined Games will NOT be releasing a retail version of this ""Masterprint"" edition after the campaign. Tue, Feb 2 2021 6:36 am EST How can i receive a copy of the rulebook in the language of my choice? The Carnegie Deluxe Edition in itself is language free. This edition comes with 4 languages standard in the box: English, French, German and Dutch. We work together with a number of partners. If you live in an area that is covered by one of these partners, you will receive extra a set of rules in that specific language. So if you live in Spain, you will get an extra set of rules in Spanish. But: if you live in France you do not get an extra set of rules since the French rules are already included in the box. Not all countries are covered by the mentioned partners. If you live in a country where we have no partner, you will receive just the box with rules in the standard 4 languages. If you live in a country and you want to receive the rules in an other language,  it is not possible to ship these rules together with the game. E.g, when you live in Italy and you want to receive the Chinese rules, we are not ship these rules together with the game. On our website you can download the rules of the game in the standard languages and the languages of our partners. During the pledge manager, you will see the options for receiving a specific rulebook in a language of your choice. Tue, Feb 2 2021 6:41 am EST Will there be a retail release of this game in your usual ""Master print"" edition? There will not. This campaign is your only chance to procure the master print edition of Carnegie. We might have some copies left after fulfillment will be done, and will sell those in very limited quantities at future game conventions, but do expect its price to be significantly higher. Tue, Feb 2 2021 6:40 am EST If I pledge €1 by selecting ""Pledge without a reward"", will I get access to the pledge manager? Yes you will. Fri, Feb 5 2021 8:09 am EST How can I add the metal Goods Cubes to my pledge? This will be handled in the pledge manager. You can already manually add €12 to your pledge when you edit it, but that is not necessary. Fri, Feb 5 2021 12:31 pm EST ?  ']",6

Longform plays like a movie or novel across four plot-driven Acts and three character-driven Intermissions. This follows a more traditional Western story structure with room for quiet scenes, interpersonal moments, and downtime. If you'd like to GM Spindlewheel, Longform is well-suited for a more directed experience. Festival plays like a TV episode or short story. The game takes place over six Events that roll directly from one Event into the next. (e.g., an Invitation into a Challenge into a Duel into an Ultimatum into a Cataclysm into a Vision...) This encourages bold moves, bombast, and mayhem. If you'd like to run Spindlewheel GMless, Festival is a great place to start. Thu, Oct 8 2020 2:29 pm EDT Can I play the game with the SPINSTER tier?

Both offer the same exact functionality and sound quality but you can choose the desired apperance to fit your style. Wed, Aug 3 2016 12:59 pm EDT Does sound leak when using the headphone function? No. The headphones act as internal headphones just like a standard pair of headphones do. The input toggle allows for the sound output to change from the drivers that play for internal listening to the external speakers that act as a dual output bluetooth speaker. Wed, Aug 3 2016 12:59 pm EDT What type of sound do you get from the headphones and speakers? Our sound output is designed to be balanced. Meaning, many other headphones describe their sound as bass driven or treble driven but we believe there isn't only 1 type of sound that's better than the rest because music calls for different accents. So we're focused on finding the right balance between musical accents. Whether you listen to rap, jazz, classical, rock, blues, EDM, etc, our focus is to create a headphone that allows for any and all genres to be actively listened to through a balanced approach.

Each cable section that connects to the central piece of the cable is 25cm (9.8 inches) long including the connector. You\'ll be able to split both sides close to half a meter (19.6 inches) away. And the total length of the cable will be 2m (6.56 feet) Fri, Dec 29 2017 10:57 pm EST I\'d like to place both sides of the keyboard far apart. Can I buy an extension cable?

Sat, Dec 30 2017 7:54 am EST Are palm rest detachable? And palm pads? Our original idea was to have detachable palm rests. We tested with multiple coders, designers and gamers and they all said that they would only remove the palm rests to transport it. Knowing that our users probably would prefer to use Raise with the palm rests, we decided to not make them detachable to reduce the manufacturing complexity and costs. Palm pads are detachable so they are easier to clean. Fri, Dec 29 2017 10:57 pm EST How tall is the palm rest? The palmrests start at 8mm (0.31in) thick, close to the thumb buttons is 12mm (0.47in) thick and the top part of Raise is 16mm (0.63in) thick. The Palm pads are detachable and are 8mm (0.31in) thick. In the final product this numbers will probably be slightly different because of the different materials and manufacturing techniques. Right now we only have one thickness for palm pads but for the future we want to have a thinner option too, in the area of 3mm (0.12in). Sat, Dec 30 2017 7:54 am EST Why DOESN\'T Raise have a number pad? Not having a physical number pad is a conscious design decision. With Raise\'s configurator software you can create multiple layouts and toggle between them instantly. Also every key in every layout can be remapped and can be a configure as a macro. So you can have the functionality of a full size keyboard in a smaller layout. For example, the first layout could be the standard typing layout and the second one could have F1-12, arrows, number pad and volume and music control. It would require some adaptation period to get used to your number pad new location but on the long run I think you\'ll love it because you won\'t need to move your hands from the home-row to use it. Sat, Dec 30 2017 7:54 am EST Can I disable or lower the intensity of the underglow or backlight with the customization software? Yes. You\'ll be able to individually control every LED and assign colors depending on the layout you are on and the function the key has. Sat, Dec 30 2017 7:54 am EST Do you support ISO and ANSI? Yes, both. Fri, Dec 29 2017 10:57 pm EST Is it possible to sync the RGB lighting with or other brands peripherals? It totally depends on the other brands giving us access so we can sync with them. Our software and firmware are open source, so the other way around it won\'t be an issue. Fri, Dec 29 2017 10:57 pm EST Raise being ergonomic, why isn\'t ortholinear? Over a year ago when we started this proyect, our first design was ortholinear. We made multiple prototypes and sold 50 for a closed beta. We tested for two months and reached the conclusion that the learning curve was too steep. If you are interested in reading about our development process, please check our blog http://www.dygma.com/blog/ Fri, Dec 29 2017 10:57 pm EST Can keys have special behaviors? Yes! A single keys can have special behaviors if you tap once, several times or hold it. For example, you could configure your Shift key so it behaves this way: Fri, Dec 29 2017 11:05 pm EST What are the benefits of a split keyboard? A normal keyboard forces the wrists to bend towards the pinky side of your hand. Rotating the split keyboard halves lets you keep your wrists at a more neutral angle which decreases pressure and strain over time. You can also adjust the total width between the two halves of the keyboard, potentially placing them directly in front of your shoulders and reducing shoulder internal rotation. You can detach any sides and play with the other and you’ll have more space for your mouse and extra thumb buttons. And if you want a normal typing experience you can just snap both sides together. Fri, Dec 29 2017 11:07 pm EST Isn\'t the spacebar key too small? I\'m concerned I\'ll missclick. The majority of people press a small area of the spacebar. Take a look at how you type and game and you’ll know which would be the best spacebar key location for you. If you use a large area or use both thumbs, our software allows you to rebind any key. You’ll be able to rebind as many keys as you need for the spacebar. Fri, Dec 29 2017 11:07 pm EST Are the 4 keys under the spacebar comfortable to use? We’ve called these keys the Under-row. We’ve tested the location of the under-row keys with professional gamers, programmers, designers and more and they loved it. This way you have fast access to more keys in a natural position for your thumbs. Even though the location may seem weird because no other keyboard has them, they are comfortable to use. Sat, Dec 30 2017 7:54 am EST The configuration software and firmware is discussed as open source. Is there a location or project page I can go to today to contribute? The configurator is called Chrysalis, and is hosted here: https://github.com/Lepidopterarium/Chrysalis Sat, Dec 30 2017 11:06 am EST What license will the ""open source"" software and firmware be released under? The firmware is released under the GPL v2 https://github.com/keyboardio/Kaleidoscope/blob/master/LICENSE The configurator is released under GPL v3 https://github.com/Lepidopterarium/Chrysalis/blob/master/COPYING Sat, Dec 30 2017 11:06 am EST How many LEDs are there in the Raise, and how are they all controlled? We’re using RGB LEDS, where each small package contains 3 separated LEDs, one for red, blue and green. Each key has an LED, and then we have 30 pointing down on each side for the underglow. This makes 135 RGBs, for 405 separate LEDs in total. We are still tuning the underglow lighting, so this number may change slightly as we go to manufacture. Controlling that many LEDs uses a lot of pins! A common method to make this easier is to use ‘clever’ LEDs that contain some processing power inside (like the WS2812), this makes it easier to drive long chains of LEDs, but the downside is cost. To keep the cost low we’re using plain RGB LEDs with a special driver that can drive a matrix of up to 75 RGB LEDs. It handles the hard parts like current control and refresh rate so we only need to update what colour we want where over an SPI interface. Sat, Dec 30 2017 11:06 am EST Would the driver be open source for all the major OSes? So that in the future we can have full control over our keyboard It works on all major OS\'s like GNU/Linux, Windows and macOS. It even works on mobile devices though it\'ll disable some LED functions due to power limitations when connected to a mobile device. It doesn\'t require any additional drivers but instead uses the built in generic keyboard drivers from the OS. All the functions such as Macros, Layers etc are handled on-board the keyboard itself with no real interaction from the OS so no extra drivers are required. Unless future OS\'s remove their keyboard drivers its going to continue working. So I guess you could say the drivers for a specific OS is as Open Source as the OS itself. The real key here is the firmware being Open Source. With the firmware and configuration software being GPLv2 and GPLv3+ respectively the Raise will continue to work even with nutty future OS\'s as long as there is a programmer willing to maintain it. The GPL is a strong copyleft license so the the code can\'t be closed. Mon, Jan 1 2018 11:55 am EST ?  ']",26

For now, you’ll only be able to pledge for the Dubler Studio Kit, which includes the Dubler software (desktop application for Mac and PC) and our Dubler USB Microphone. There are a few reasons we include the microphone in the kit, all centred on guaranteeing the best out of the box experience. That’s not to say you couldn’t try it with your own mic setup if you want. With the right setup and a bit of hand tuning, you may even be able to achieve good results. We aren't in the business of trying to tie people in with locking hardware. So the mic won’t technically be required to make the software operate - but in reality, the software won’t be guaranteed to work well with other hardware. For a guaranteed optimal experience - use the Dubler mic! There are some other added benefits to our mic. Being USB it’s great for convenience or being on the road. You don’t need a separate audio interface to use it. You can also, of course, use the Dubler microphone as a normal microphone too. We are working with a highly respected microphone manufacturer to produce the units. This enables us to choose components that especially suit our use case. For example, our microphone has a built-in double shock housing to reduce any accidentally MIDI triggers resulting from handling noise. Tue, Mar 26 2019 6:17 am EDT Why are you on Kickstarter if people have already been using the kits? We developed 20 pre-launch kits and we assigned them to artists and people that we have been working with throughout development to get their feedback for our further product development. We came to Kickstarter for a variety of reasons. One of them is the community, there are loads of cool music tech projects that come through Kickstarter many of which we have backed in the past - it feels like the natural choice. We’re also looking to build an amazing community of music-makers from the ground up, and we know this is the place to do it. We’re also a small team of 4 people building a totally new product - that takes money whether hardware or software! We’re on track and we’ve almost completed development, but we still need the cash flow to manufacture the microphones and tie up the last few bits. Mon, Mar 11 2019 6:46 pm EDT Can I use Dubler Studio Kit with something other than the voice? Yes, it would definitely be possible to do something interesting! We’re focused on the voice, as it’s our natural tool for audio expression, but actually, there is scope to experiment with all sorts of audio inputs— including other instruments, or clicking, clapping or stamping your feet! Our pre-launch tester Luna Neptune did some of this with her kit— check out the video. In the past, we’ve played around with an acoustic guitar and tried things like using palm muting to control effects on the DAW. Dubler Studio Kit is a tool for creative expression, and its possibilities are limitless! Mon, Mar 11 2019 7:12 pm EDT What if you can’t sing? For all those out there who can't hold a tune - Dubler Studio Kit still has a lot to offer. For one thing, you can restrict the key, to help keep you in tune. And for many use cases, the pitch doesn't matter at all - such as triggering samples or controlling effects. In fact, you could use Dubler Studio Kit to manipulate multiple dimensional filters and effects on a melody simultaneously played on another instrument (a MIDI keyboard for example). Mon, Mar 11 2019 6:46 pm EDT Isn’t this just a tool for people with no musical talent? Dubler Studio Kit is a creative tool for music making. Like any tool, what’s created is up to the artist [simple or complex, amazing or awful]. The advantage of Dubler is that our starting point is the voice. That gives everyone a head start on other MIDI controllers; as the voice is a tool we’re all very practiced at using. That means it’s still intuitive to use for someone with no traditional musical training. Making it quicker and easier to get started making beats, melodies, and compositions. But that’s just the start. The range and depth of sounds even the average voice can make, is incredible. Try manipulating 4 control dimensions on a keyboard, at the same time as playing a melody and simultaneously crafting the envelope of the audio. It would be impossible. But, the voice can capture that level of expression. Ultimately the result is always going to come down to the artist. But as techniques go; composing with the voice has had some pretty good results. It worked for Quincey Jones. Mon, Mar 11 2019 6:46 pm EDT But you can already do this in Ableton. What’s the difference? Then there is the sample triggering and selection. If you select “drums” as the output for Ableton Audio-to-MIDI it will attempt to break up the input into drum rack triggers. But (and I’m sorry Ableton) is really doesn’t do this well. It’s also limited to hi-hat, kick, and snare. With Dubler Studio Kit you can accurately trigger loads of different samples. Our software learns your voice so it will always trigger the right sample  instead of just guessing based on frequency. Oh and with Ableton you have to choose - drums or melody. With Dubler you can do both at the same time. Mon, Mar 11 2019 6:46 pm EDT Isn’t this the same as Melodyne? Melodyne is a cool piece of software but very different from Dubler Studio Kit. Dubler is a virtual MIDI controller. So the software runs on your mac/pc and your DAW just sees Dubler as any other MIDI controller. Melodyne is more about editing and less about live control. Their pitch analysis software is great but they ignore all of the additional qualities and timbre you can put into your voice. Dubler learns your voice enabling you to: Select and trigger samples: E.g. live beatboxing triggering drum samples or clapping/clicking/tapping to trigger whatever you want. This includes velocity control and envelope following. Synth control: live control pitch, velocity, envelope and pitch bend all by singing/humming etc. Effects control: The timbre of your voice (e.g. hmmm vs. laaa vs. ooohh) controls 4 CC dials. Map these to any effects, filters, synth or DAW parameters you like. You can even use this to allow you select between and blend different synths. Mon, Mar 11 2019 6:46 pm EDT Buying MIDI controllers just before releasing MIDI 2.0 is kinda stupid, isn't it? MIDI 2.0 hasn't broken any old functionality, it is backwards compatible. Also, as we are partially a software offering, we can (and will) take advantage of MIDI 2.0 as soon as it's released via updates. It's also unlikely that most DAWs will support it for a couple more years anyway. Mon, Mar 11 2019 7:18 pm EDT Isn’t this just what Mogees does? We think Mogees are really cool! But I’m afraid it’s simply not the same as our technology. With Dubler we use all the timbral qualities of the voice. Trigger samples, control synths and manipulate filters/effects all live, using your voice. It’s not just the note you sing but the way you sing it. With Dubler you can trigger samples, track pitch, apply pitch-bend, affect the envelope, alter velocity all whilst 4 CC values can be simultaneously controlled based on the way you make a sound. Dubler learns your voice enabling you to: Select and trigger samples: E.g. live beatboxing triggering drum samples or clapping/clicking/tapping to trigger whatever you want. This includes velocity control. Synth control: live control pitch, velocity, envelope and pitch bend all by singing/humming etc Effects control: The timbre of your voice (e.g. hmmm vs. laaa vs. ooohh) controls 4 CC dials. Map these to any effects, filters, synth or DAW parameters you like. You can even use this to allow you select between and blend different synths. Wed, Mar 13 2019 6:28 am EDT Isn’t this the same as The Mouth? In short - No. The Mouth is great but very different to Dubler, and a lot more limited. The Mouth is good for post processing— it listens to the input audio and applies some cool effects or controllers a synthesiser based on the audio input. It does track pitch and does some very basic audio analysis - but that's about as far as the similarities go. Dubler is a live controller. Effects, notes and samples are not applied as a post processing manipulation but controlled live based on the timbre of your voice. Dubler is a multi dimensional MIDI controller. Like a MIDI keyboard and an MPC rolled into one, but controlled using the voice. The Mouth is more like a vocoder/autotune plugin, with a few extra bells and whistles. Mon, Mar 11 2019 6:46 pm EDT Isn’t this the same as Imitone? Again - no... Imitone is cool but it is purely pitch to MIDI. Dubler also incorporates pitch control but that is just one of its functions: trigger samples (e.g. through beatboxing), apply pitch bend, perform envelope following, velocity scaling and control 4 CC values simultaneously - all based on the way you make a sound. So with Dubler it’s not just about the pitch of the sound you make, but about the type of sound you make as a whole. Mon, Mar 11 2019 7:22 pm EDT What’s wrong with real musicians - why are you ruining music creation!? If you’ve read this far you hopefully don’t agree with this question, but it is (very occasionally) a point of view some people have. And one, not surprisingly, we disagree with.

We take the Covid19 pandemic very seriously and have tightened our hygiene measures in both Ghana and Germany. We work mostly in the home office and have introduced the wearing of face masks in the office. Fortunately, we do not expect any delays in the building of the factory and expect production to start on time in September 2020.

Until now, we have been using aluminum foil to protect our chocolate from external contamination. Aluminum takes a lot of energy when it’s produced which is why we have been looking for alternatives that are compatible with our machine that we use to wrap our chocolate as well as food safety regulagtions. NatureFlex is a foil which has been successfully tested and used by other companies. It has the same properties regarding food safety and is as aroma-tight as aluminum.The foil is made from wood cellulose. For the production of one kilogramm of NatureFlex foil, 5,05 kg of CO2 equivalents are emitted. That is half of what is emitted when producing (primary) aluminum. As the foil is made from organic material, it is fully compostable – even in your garden compost. This has been approved by the label „OK compost HOME“. According to this label (and the European standard EN 13 432), 90% of the material needs to be decomposed after six months (182 days).

You can grab that piece of artwork by backing at the $3 ""Bystander"" tier. Sun, May 3 2020 6:38 am EDT ""Money back guarantee?"" Yes indeed. I\'m absolutely serious about you walking away from this campaign happy with what you\'ve gotten. If you\'re not happy and feel I\'ve wronged you in our transactions, get in touch and if I can\'t solve the problem, I\'ll issue you a full refund. It\'s that simple. Sun, May 3 2020 6:39 am EDT ""I\'m just waiting until payday. I really want to back this campaign!"" That\'s not a question, but you make the cut for sheer enthusiasm. I just want to take this moment to clear up a common misconception among people who may not have used Kickstarter before, because it differs from many common pre-order systems. The main thing I want to clarify is that Kickstarter won\'t take your money straight away when you pledge. Money will only be taken from your card if the campaign reaches its funding target; and will take it on the day the campaign ends (June 13). For absolute clarity: you won\'t need that money in your account now - you need it there on June 13. So if there\'s a particular reward you\'ve got your eye on, it\'s safer to claim it immediately, or risk missing out entirely. Sun, May 3 2020 6:39 am EDT ""Should I wait until this hits the stores instead?"" I don\'t think so. And here\'s why. This version of Triumviratus is longer than the one that will be available from stores. This version includes a nine-page epilogue. Also, this is the only way to snag yourself the other great gear on offer, such as reams of behind-the-scenes content, and a two hour audio commentary for the book! It\'s also cheaper here, and you get the book much more quickly. Sun, May 3 2020 6:39 am EDT ""Hey, I run this service that can help to boost your project\'s visibility/ranking...""

There\'s a reward tier called ""Brotherhood"" - back at that level, and the book can be yours. If you\'re anywhere else in the world, I\'ve got some bad news: my post office isn\'t accepting overseas parcels at the moment, due to uncertainties caused by the global pandemic and collapse of distribution chains. If that situation eases, I\'ll certainly make the book more widely available. Fri, May 8 2020 8:24 pm EDT ?  ']",6

Nous offrons une vaste gamme d'articles pour hommes et femmes tels que chandails, t-shirts, camisoles, souliers, bottes, bijoux et accessoires que les rockers de ce monde adorent! Nous sommes maintenant prêts à élaborer notre propre marque, notre propre brand afin d'offrir à nos clients des produits uniques, spécialement dessinés pour tous les trashers de ce monde en quête d'un look original et bad ass à son maximum. Grâce à ce projet de socio-financement, nous pourrons débuter notre gamme en créant les premiers items suivants: Pour parvenir à un brand original, de qualité et unique, nous devrons procéder et investir dans les étapes suivantes: À notre avis, trop peu de boutiques offrent exclusivement des produits de style trash/rock, surtout au Canada. Les adeptes de look trash doivent magasiner dans de nombreux endroits différents afin de trouver tout ce qui leur plaît à des prix compétitifs. Nous comptons remédier à la situation en proposant, au niveau international, une boutique en ligne offrant une vaste gamme d'articles pour hommes et femmes qui propose des prix abordables, une livraison rapide et gratuite partout à travers le monde, des produits génériques et de marque (l'objet de ce projet) et un style 100% rock pour nos fans.

Voici la version française expliquant les récompenses: Mon, Nov 13 2017 1:25 pm EST Puis-je voir la traduction française des risques et obstacles possibles du projet? Voici la version française concernant les risques liés au projet : Une préparation et une organisation efficace et exemplaire saura réduire au maximum les risques et obstacles associés à notre projet. Toutefois, nous restons conscients que chaque projet d'entreprise comprend son lot de mésaventures et de défis. En voici quelques-un pour lesquels nous sommes prêts et déterminés à surmonter. Retard dans la production des designs et dessins: nous comptons sur 3 artistes professionnels pour nous aider dans la création des articles. Ces derniers se sont formellement engagés à respecter les délais établis et à nous informer de tout retard ou problème potentiel. Nous avons également un artiste ''de secours'' qui serait prêt à prendre la relève en cas de besoin. Difficulté à trouver les manufacturiers adéquats: nous savons que la recherche de manufacturiers ne sera pas de tout repos. Nous voulons des produits de qualité, répondant à nos critères, pouvant être produits et livrés rapidement, sans surprises ni problème, offrant une disponibilité, un service à la clientèle et un service après vente exemplaires. Nous ne compterons pas les heures à investir afin de dénicher la perle rare et tiendrons nos contributeurs informés de chaque entente établie et problématique rencontrée. Retard dans la réception des items commandés: nous avons prévu une période tampon d'environ une semaine à chaque étape de notre projet. Nous comptons sur les manufacturiers que nous aurons trouvé pour respecter les délais convenus, par contre nous sommes prêts et avons envisagé un retard possible. Encore une fois, nos contributeurs seront informés à chaque étape du processus. Nous désirons faire preuve de transparence et d'honnêteté envers les gens qui nous soutiennent. Budget : des dépassements de coûts peuvent arriver à chaque étape de notre projet. Nous croyons cependant avoir établi des projections réalistes, basées sur des recherches diligentes et bien préparées. Nous avons plusieurs plans de contingences établis afin de résoudre tout dépassement de coûts qui pourrait survenir. Ultimement, même si le projet échoue (ce qui ne risque pas d'arriver mais cela reste toujours une possibilité) nous sommes déjà en mesure de respecter nos promesses envers nos contributeurs puisque notre boutique est déjà en ligne et bien établie. Les gens ayant déboursé afin de soutenir notre projet de branding pourront quand même recevoir leurs articles, peu importe que la collection unique soit une réussite ou non. Mon, Nov 13 2017 1:25 pm EST Puis-je avoir la traduction française de votre profil personnel? Voici la version française de la section ''About Caroline'' : Native de la région de l'Outaouais, au Québec, Caroline est travailleuse autonome depuis plus de 10 ans dans le domaine de la rédaction, de la révision et de la correction de textes, en plus d’être répartitrice médicale d’urgence, auteure publiée, propriétaire d’une entreprise web d’échanges de propriétés et d’une boutique de vêtements et accessoires en ligne. Passionnée de musique rock, punk et métal, d'art contemporain et de mode alternative, elle a longtemps mis ces intérêts de côté pour se concentrer sur une carrière ''plus sérieuse''. Arrivée à la mi-trentaine, elle désire maintenant plus que tout exploiter sa vraie identité, sa nature profonde et sa personnalité quelque peu rebelle afin de mettre à profit ses passions pour la musique et la mode trash dans une boutique en ligne et à pignon sur rue où son expérience entrepreneuriale lui permettra d'assurer le succès de sa marque et de mettre en marché le brand auquel elle compte donner vie. ''Toute ma vie j'ai développé des entreprises et j'ai travaillé dans des cadres formels, guindés, où l'image corporative prend toute la place. J'ai porté des tailleurs accompagnés du typique attaché-case et je devais constamment projeter une image de femme d'affaires sérieuse, professionnelle et conforme aux stéréotypes qui viennent avec ce genre d'environnement. J'ai travaillé dans le domaine immobilier, où l'argent mène le monde, où les gens se comparent de par le niveau luxe de leur voiture et de par le nombre de gros clients que contient leur carnet d’adresses. Toute ma vie j'ai donc mis en veilleuse ce que j'étais vraiment, j'ai dissimulé ma vraie personnalité afin de plaire aux patrons, aux clients et aux partenaires d'affaires. Il me fallait jouer de mon talent de caméléon et afficher mon plus beau sourire durant des 5 à 7 et cocktails interminables où tous et chacun tente de s'approprier de nouveaux contrats et de pousser leur gamme de services à qui veut bien l'entendre.'' ''Il m'a fallu une petite crise de la trentaine pour enfin comprendre que ce monde stérile, froid et rigide ne me convenait plus et qu'il ne m'avait en fait jamais convenu. J'ai choisi de me choisir et d'en faire mon gagne-pain. J'ai choisi de combiner mon goût pour l'entrepreneuriat, pour la musique rock, pour l'art et la mode trash et d'en créer une carrière. Avec Trashcan.rocks, ma boutique en ligne, je peux recommencer à porter mes jeans déchirés, mes bracelets à rivets, mes manteaux de cuir et mon vernis à ongle noir sans crainte d'être jugée ou regardée de haut. Je peux maintenant travailler dans une ambiance rock, rester qui je suis, pour desservir des gens comme moi, qui n'ont pas peur d’afficher leur marginalité, d’exploiter leur personnalité rebelle et anti-conformiste au jour le jour. J’ai préféré être jugée pour qui je suis plutôt qu’être acceptée pour ce que je ne suis pas. Je désire, grâce à Trashcan.rocks, offrir aux gens des vêtements, chaussures et accessoires à mon image, qui sauront plaire aux rockers de ce monde. C’est la carrière, le projet et le mode de vie que j’aurais dû choisir depuis longtemps. Mais il parfois difficile d’user de son fond anarchiste pour assumer ses désirs profonds lorsque ces derniers entrent en conflit avec l’establishment et le cadre social attendu et la pression qu’il engendre. Maintenant que c’est fait, je sais que Trashcan.rocks sera un succès puisque 100% de mon cœur, de mon expérience, de mes connaissances et de mon temps y sont investis. Une entreprise menée par la passion ne peut qu’offrir un résultat intéressant et positif, c'est ma philosophie!'' Mon, Nov 13 2017 1:25 pm EST ?  ""]",4

As much as I like and supported the Vita, which I'll always be grateful for introducing me to console development, Brok is a much more technical demanding game. Before switching to GameMaker Studio 2 (which doesn't have support for Vita export) I attempted to run it on the devkit and it's clear this would have required a lot of performance tweaks - while Brok runs near-perfect on the Switch devkit already. With a release date planned for early 2022 on consoles this is too late for the Vita. Tue, Jan 5 2021 1:51 pm EST Why no physical copies on consoles? Tue, Jan 5 2021 1:51 pm EST What about mobile (iOS, Android)? Demetrios did not sell very well on mobile. This is a difficult market where only free-to-play monetization seems to do well, and adventure games cannot work with it - such change would corrupt the core gameplay. Brok will probably end up on mobile someday, but this is a low priority. Tue, Jan 5 2021 1:51 pm EST Why isn't the prologue available on Mac/Linux? Tue, Jan 5 2021 1:51 pm EST Will you be one of those devs ditching the Steam version for Epic exclusivity? NEVER. The only way my games would come out on the Epic Game Store would be non-exclusive. Tue, Jan 5 2021 1:51 pm EST What happens if you can't deliver one specific version? Tue, Jan 5 2021 1:51 pm EST Will keys be region locked? Steam and GOG keys can be used worldwide. For consoles, it varies. Xbox keys also work worldwide except China. I plan to release on Nintendo Switch in North America, Europe and Japan. For PlayStation, I expect to release in North America and Europe only. (no IARC age rating support yet in Japan) Tue, Jan 5 2021 1:51 pm EST ?  ""]",8

Over its 20-year history, the festival has hosted hundreds of dance companies from over 20 different countries. We are thrilled and honored to be the first American company to participate. Mon, Feb 29 2016 6:19 pm EST How do you expect the company and the work to be received in Cuba? Art is one of the most meaningful layers of cross-cultural communication and international exchange. Further, site-specific dance is a great equalizer, requiring no training, experience or education for participation. Heidi Duckler Dance Theatre will continue its policy of open rehearsals while in Cuba and hopes to bring a new form of, or take on, site-specific art for the people of Havana. We hope Havanans will engage with us during the choreography process and the performance. We love taking questions from on-lookers, discussing the work, learning their personal stories and hopefully providing them with the opportunity to see their familiar places in entirely unexpected ways.

This past winter would have chewed it up. The hull for our Breakwater vessel is made of steel, so the ice doesn\'t damage it like it can with fiberglass hulls.  Our naval engineers are still determining if it\'s worth adding a ""bubbler"" system that keeps water moving around the hull to prevent ice from forming alongside it.  Great question, though, thank you! Wed, Jun 11 2014 4:28 pm EDT Does Beau have his own sailboat? I\'d like to go sailing this summer, please! Beau joined a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit sailing club called Sail Chicago three years ago, which is the most economical way for Chicagoans to get out on the water. It also happens to be the only way for Beau\'s entrepreneurial budget to afford summer sailing. Check out their website - www.SailChicago.org - and consider joining, even if you\'ve never been on a sailboat in your life; their beginners classes are great! Thu, Jun 12 2014 10:52 am EDT Can I get more than one regular ($25) or VIP invitations ($100) to the pre-launch Kickstarter party? The rewards for regular and VIP invitations to the Breakwater pre-launch party are good for one person, but you may purchase multiple tickets by increasing your donation amount and keeping the same reward level.  For example, if you want two VIP tickets you would enter $200 as the donation amount and select the $100 donation level.  After doing so, please send us a direct message with the name of your additional guest(s) and we\'ll make sure you each receive your invitations. Mon, Jun 16 2014 11:43 am EDT ?  ']",3

The reason for this is that we intend to include NSFW (18+) content in the game, and most consoles will not allow that kind of content. We have mulled over the idea of removing the NSFW content in the future in order to port, but that is not yet determined or decided upon and we do not have a definite 'yes', so to play it safe, we are NOT currently going on any plans to do so.

2099,882744766,"[' I am concerned about the content of this game. Who should I speak with? We stand by this credo: researched and inspired by history, the characters, world and situations in FLAMES OF FREEDOM are a work of fiction. This game was designed, developed and produced by a multicultural team of diverse identities, beliefs and orientation. We took measures early in our process to prioritize Black, femme, Indigenous and marginalized freelancers to lead development in their respective areas. This includes numerous cultural consultants from the Indigenous nations we represent, accessibility readers to make FLAMES OF FREEDOM a great user experience, perspectives on sex positivity and how we treat trauma with maturity (and not as a throwaway \'sanity\' mechanic). We have given all of our freelancers carte blanche to speak critically and openly about their experiences with FLAMES OF FREEDOM, if they choose to do so. We\'ll be featuring some of our developers in coming interviews throughout the Kickstarter. Watch this space. Mon, Oct 5 2020 6:16 pm EDT Will FLAMES OF FREEDOM be compatible with Zweihander RPG & Main Gauche? It sure will! As with every game powered by Zweihander RPG, while each game have its own special demands or unique qualities to meet its play style, FLAMES OF FREEDOM will be 100% compatible with the Zweihander RPG game line. Mon, Oct 5 2020 6:03 pm EDT What\'s the difference between FLAMES OF FREEDOM and Colonial Gothic? FLAMES OF FREEDOM is the successor to the Colonial Gothic line. With original manuscript by Richard Iorio, this tabletop RPG has been expanded and clarified, with new content, perspectives, rules and story. Mon, Oct 5 2020 6:03 pm EDT Will FLAMES OF FREEDOM be compatible with Colonial Gothic? The games\' rules will not be. However, we do have some interesting announcements in the coming weeks about fan-based compatibility options. Watch this space!

Here\'s our current estimates for book only: Tue, Oct 6 2020 10:22 am EDT Do the shipping costs include customs charges (VAT/GST)? They do not. Depending on where you live, VAT/GST (""customs"") may be added to your order in Backerkit. After collecting these fees, our fulfillment partner SkuTouch will pay the taxes and file paperwork for you. This will ensure a seamless, zero frustration shipping scenario for worldwide backers. Although we do call this out in our Kickstarter under Customs & Taxes, we will add this to our FAQ to reduce confusion. Tue, Oct 6 2020 2:11 pm EDT ?  ']",6

The exact address and arrival instructions will be sent to those who purchase tickets, a few days in advance of their ticketed date. Tue, Apr 9 2019 8:31 pm EDT How many audience member experience ""The Nest"" at once? Each ticket secures a dedicated timeslot for you to experience the show. Each ticket allows entry for up to two people, so you may choose to go alone or to bring a friend. We never pair strangers together. Tue, Apr 9 2019 4:32 pm EDT Is this show different than 2017\'s production of ""The Nest""? In general, yes. Although we are still using the same basic framework of Josie\'s story, we have redesigned the experience from the ground up, including new puzzles and interactions, audio tapes, and a new layout that takes advantage of our beautiful new space. Tue, Apr 9 2019 4:37 pm EDT Is this a scary experience? Not really. Think tense mystery rather than horror. Do keep in mind that the show takes place in a darkened room and deals with mature themes such as the loss of loved ones. Tue, Apr 9 2019 4:37 pm EDT Are there any advisements for the show? The show lasts approximately 50 minutes with no intermission, and takes place in a darkened space lit by flashlight. Therefore, it is not recommended for audiences not comfortable walking, standing for periods of time, being alone, or momentarily being in complete darkness. (Please see below for accessibility information.) We strongly advise audience members with severe claustrophobia against attending. The content does contain some mature themes such as the loss of a loved one, and uses some mild language. Tue, Apr 9 2019 8:30 pm EDT Is ""The Nest"" accessible? Our location was built in the 1920\'s, before the advent of ADA codes. However, we strive to accommodate everyone as best as possible - please contact us if you have any specific questions.

Sun, Oct 18 2020 5:24 am EDT Some of the Dice Towers seem to not have Dice stoppers or a wall. Is it correct? Most of them have a wall that seems too short. The height of the wall is relevant to the total height of the tower. The total height of the wall should be at about 2cm, taking in consideration the standard diameter of a D20 is 2.5cm.

I imagine kickstarter doesn't accept paypal because the chances of someone being unhappy with a project that isn't fulfilling fast enough could file for a chargeback and then things get very messy. The only alternatives I can think of is borrow the credit card of someone you trust, or get one of those prepaid credit cards in a convenience store... sorry! Thu, Sep 19 2019 3:18 am EDT What are your plans once we reach the goal? If we reach the goal, the first thing we'll do is finish up the files we need to send to the printer (almost there!) and organize invoices to be efficient in our fulfillment. while we wait on the money to get to us. Once it does, we'll be sending our order to the book printer and get started on the rewards- most of which Caroline is going to handle and print herself at her job, making sure everything's all good. Afterwards it's just a matter of back and forth with the book printer until we have a book that looks up to our standards and ship everything! Digital rewards should be done around the time we send our files to the book printer, after all edits and preparations are done. Once everything has been fulfilled to all backers, we hope to drop the books in bookstores since part of our budget includes ISBN numbers (and barcodes)! Thu, Sep 19 2019 3:18 am EDT What happens if we don't reach the goal? If we don't reach the goal on this kickstarter no one gets charged, first of all. Which means that we get none of the funds to make this happen. The most likely scenario is that we're still going to get the book done anyway, but by saving money via sales on our stores, personal commissions and whatever else we can spare. This is understandably going to be taking much longer, and we're not going to try another kickstarter again even for a different project- at least not for the foreseeable future! Thu, Sep 19 2019 3:18 am EDT Why is international shipping so expensive? This is sadly the amount it costs us to ship the book out internationally. We spent an entire day trying to find a cheaper cost, but there isn't! In fact it's actually 22$ but we rounded it down to make it a bit less awful; this is sadly a very big and heavy book! To compensate we've made all paper rewards practically free in all tiers with books, so hopefully it's worth your consideration. If you're interested in the book at all, you should get it now since the shipping costs won't change even if we end up putting it for sale later online- and it won't come with any of the extra goodies either! Thu, Sep 19 2019 3:18 am EDT I'm confused about the bookplate- what is it and how do I add it to my pledge? You know how some books you open and they have a “this book belongs to ___” area inside the cover? That's a bookplate! The ones we offer are stickers, so you can stick them wherever you feel like, but we'll make sure there's a designated suggested place for it! It's also the area where I sign your book, if that's something you'd like. To add it to your pledge, just take your current amount and add 10$- so if you have Road to Adventure and ship to America it would be like this: 25$, plus 10$ shipping, plus the bookplate makes 45$.

2154,1358532565,"[' What is the meaning behind the title Love Trap? Love Trap is a play on words relating to love and the music genre known as Trap. Electronic music blending hard-hitting and heavy instrumentation with a variety of vocal styles, the lyrical content and general message behind Trap music is motivation to hustle, usually with the implication that the hustle is in pursuit of money. Love Trap hones in on a different topic of hustle- that to “trap hate and spread love” to as great a degree as possible. I created this music in order to encourage people to stay strong and peace-making even though it may seem sometimes as if the whole world around us is filled with hate and negativity. Even though it seems impossible sometimes, we should always run ourselves as if we are each an individual Trap, which stockpiles hate and doesn’t let it go, while putting out the product of love. Sat, Jan 6 2018 1:49 am EST How do you plan to market the album? I have an extensive, written plan, including: Within every copy’s sleeve will be links to the downloadable copy, all of my blogs and social media, and all other products I have for sale. I will monitor email closely for opportunities. After they are all off, I will be hitting the studio for Love Trap 2. The first Love Trap will have built an audience for round 2, and upon release of 2, touring will commence. Sat, Jan 6 2018 6:33 pm EST ?  ']",2

2188,1323185961,"[' Can I use my own receiver and transmitter with the Pathfinder Package? Yes, there is space in Sprite to install your own receiver.  The Pathfinder Package was intended for people who either didn\'t want to use a conventional radio transmitter with Sprite or for people who want to install their own equipment. If your receiver uses PPM or S.Bus or is a Spektrum Satellite receiver, you\'re good to go. If instead your receiver outputs all the individual PWM channels you\'ll need an encoder, they are approximately $20 and you can get them through the 3DR website. The space available is approximately 2.0"" x 1.25"" x 0.75"" so most standard radio receivers will fit.  If FPV equipment is not installed there will be additional room if you have a larger than average receiver. Some additional info on compatible receivers is available here: http://copter.ardupilot.com/wiki/common-pixhawk-and-px4-compatible-rc-transmitter-and-receiver-systems/ Mon, May 25 2015 7:47 am EDT Does Sprite support a live video stream? The HD camera included in either Sprite package supports a live video stream, however a video transmitter and antenna are required to broadcast the video to a monitor on the ground.  The transmitter and antenna are not included with Sprite, but space is available to install your own.  UPDATE: First person view (FPV) reward options are now available! Sun, May 31 2015 9:02 am EDT Does Sprite support iOS devices? We\'ve been watching a lot of drone projects here on Kickstarter over the last year or two, and a lot of them have faced delivery challenges that have stemmed from efforts to include many different layers of new technology at the same time. To avoid that trap and significantly decrease the technical risks of bringing Sprite to market, we very carefully have decided to use as many proven, commercially available components as possible. The flight controller and autopilot is one of them. We settled on the most current APM system available, which has evolved over several years and earned its place among the most reliable and powerful platforms. It is trusted by thousands of pilots around the world, and has amassed tens of thousands of flight hours on countless missions. Sprite supports all of the features it provides, including waypoint navigation and all of the other autonomous flight modes, and the only development that has been necessary has been to get the stabilization logic to work with Sprite. As you can see, that\'s been done, and there are only a few final elements that need to be optimized. Unfortunately, along with all of the benefits come a few limitations, and currently that includes lack of iOS support. APM is an open source platform, however, and when (and if) an iOS version of the mission software is available, Sprite will work with it. In the meantime, we iOS devotees still have a few options. First, Sprite can be programmed for autonomous flight using a laptop. Admittedly, that\'s not the most convenient for backcountry operations. You can also fly Sprite with autonomous modes stored in memory, or using a conventional RC transmitter. Otherwise, fortunately there are a wide variety of relatively inexpensive Android devices available that not only serve as a ground station, but also a USB-enabled device that\'s a great place to store all of the amazing photos and video you\'re going to take with Sprite. Thanks again for your interest and support, and we hope to see you among our backers! Wed, May 20 2015 8:06 am EDT Does Sprite Come with a HD Camera? Yes, both Sprite packages come with a HD camera.  The dual-axis mount announced in our first Update is intended to replace the originally developed single-axis mount. Wed, May 20 2015 11:33 am EDT What is the average life of the battery? The flight endurance of Sprite will depend largely on the conditions it is operating in and the mass of the payload it is carrying.  One of our pressing development goals is to optimize Sprite\'s propulsion systems which includes the blade geometry, gear ratios and motor/battery sizing.  This optimization will significantly increase the efficiency adding several minutes to the flight time.  That being said, our current flight time is around 12 min Wed, May 20 2015 12:02 pm EDT How fast can Sprite travel, and what kind of wind conditions can it operate in? Like any aircraft, Sprite\'s ability to hold a stationary position in a headwind would depend on it\'s maximum forward airspeed. We\'ll be doing a full battery of performance validation later this summer, but based on what we\'ve seen with the prototypes, we\'d estimate that to be around 10-12 m/s. That\'s about 25 mph...a pretty good breeze! Mon, May 25 2015 8:13 am EDT I\'m interested in becoming a Sprite distributor.  What can I do? We\'ve received dozens and dozens of inquiries about distribution opportunities, and we\'d like to say how much we appreciate the interest!  We have not decided on a distribution strategy yet, but when we do we\'ll be posting information on our website.  In the meantime, feel free to send an e-mail to info@ascentaerosystems.com and put the word ""Distribution"" in the subject line.  Thanks again! Wed, May 27 2015 8:23 am EDT I see you just introduced the Payload Developers Kit (PDK).  How much weight will Sprite be able to carry? The maximum payload weight will depend on a number of design factors, and not all of them have been finalized. Environmental conditions (density altitude) will also impact performance. Like any aircraft, Sprite will be able to lift more at sea level on a cooler day than at higher elevations in warm temperatures. Much depends on the final motor selections, gearing ratios, and blade geometry. As part of the beta program this later summer, we’ll be collecting data from all corners of the world. We will have beta testers in the southern hemisphere for whom it will be winter, so we’ll be able to get cold weather data as well. Ultimately we’ll be publishing a weight that ensures the ability to hover out of ground effect at a number of temperatures and altitudes. For now, please visit our website www.ascentaerosystems.com/sprite for available specifications. Sun, May 31 2015 9:02 am EDT What are the regulations around first person view (FPV) technology? The regulations around first person view (FPV) vary by country, so please be sure to check your local laws. Some countries limit the frequencies and/or the output power of the video transmitter.  For more information you can start with your country\'s radio control modeling enthusiasts communities, where lots of information is likely to be available. If you are still unsure, we would suggest that you choose the Sprite reward package that does not include the FPV equipment. Sprite\'s design will make it easy to add your own components later.

If you choose one of these tier levels you\'ll receive the digital version of AWA 16 by the end of May. The printed version will arrive with AWA: Impact Zone and other rewards as soon as we can print and ship them (by July). Tue, Apr 14 2020 8:43 pm EDT Are the characters from the original A Weekend Alone in this comic? No, this comic contains a cast of entirely new characters. However, the bonus content (pinups, wallpaper, mini comics, etc.) will feature characters (such as Valerie, Mary-Jean, and Sarah) in ways never seen before (naked, barefoot, in special outfits, and more). Tue, Apr 14 2020 8:43 pm EDT The art of AWA: Impact Zone looks a bit different from the original series. Is the artist the same? This project is a collaboration between different talented artists. AWA: Impact Zone has the same line artist (Jiuen) but paired with another colorist (Ylenia Di Napoli). This collaboration helped us create this project without creating any major delays in the production of the main AWA series. The stretch goal rewards feature art from numerous other artists with different styles. We think it\'s awesome to see different takes on the original characters of the series! Tue, Apr 14 2020 8:43 pm EDT Why is the printed book so big? The comic features depictions of tiny people in vast scenes. The subtle details of the scene will be lost if printed on a tiny page. An 8.5"" x 11"" page is large enough to fully enjoy the artwork and fit on a shelf or storage box. Tue, Apr 14 2020 8:43 pm EDT Are you offering a hardcover version? No, not at this moment. If this project is successful, we may consider offering a hardcover version as a reward for a future crowdfunding campaign. Tue, Apr 14 2020 8:43 pm EDT Are you offering add-on rewards (e.g. can I get a printed version of some other comic as a reward)? We are not offering add-on rewards. Kickstarter\'s system does not make it easy to offer add-ons in a simple manner. Tue, Apr 14 2020 8:43 pm EDT Will you ship the book to international backers? Yes but you will be responsible for any import duties or fees incurred. We also urge you to make sure adult comic books are legal in your locality  -- don\'t assume they are!

2247,136947923,"["" WHAT IS THIS PROJECT FOR? The Cleveland Flea is building furniture — tables, benches, bar, stools and other furniture — to [almost] accommodate the 20,000-30,000 shoppers at our monthly event in Tyler Village. We're reaching out to our community to help us raise the funds for the project. It's the first phase of our goal to #BuildTheFlea a real home in Cleveland. Wed, Apr 22 2015 9:41 am EDT WHY WILL THE PROJECT COST $40,000? We weren't surprised when plenty of people asked why a furniture project costs $40,000. The easy answer: we're serving 20,000-30,000 people each month with the furniture. That's less than $2/person, just at our next event. The real answer: you get what you pay for. Working with local designer 2nd Shift Design Studio to custom-craft furniture to our specific needs and then commissioning a Cleveland woodshop (hello, Soulcraft!) to manufacture the collection costs more than buying in bulk from, say, Ikea. Oh, does it feel better, too! Investing in our local economy hits at the very core of the Cleveland Flea. That's why we started. It's why we exist. It stays true to our mission to continue building the Flea with Cleveland's power, talent and support. Wed, Apr 22 2015 9:41 am EDT WOULDN'T IT JUST BE MORE COST EFFECTIVE TO GO TO IKEA? Cost effective? Well, maybe. In the short term. But you get what you pay for. We'd like to make a solid investment in quality, custom-crafted furniture that meets our service and functionality needs. We don't want to buy furniture to serve 20,000-30,000 people each month, only to need to replace it several times each year. More importantly, we believe in our local economy and Cleveland’s talented small-business community. Supporting and growing our local economy is at the core of everything the Cleveland Flea does and stands for. Wed, Apr 22 2015 9:41 am EDT WHAT FUNCTIONALITY DOES THIS CUSTOM FURNITURE HAVE? Optimized for fast assembly on Cleveland Flea mornings (and quick break-down on Flea nights), the furniture is also made to stack-and-store, taking up just a few feet of our storage unit. And let's just say, there are not a lot of feet to spare. We love it when form meets function. Functionality is key in this project. Partnering with local design shop 2nd Shift Design Studio has made meeting that need possible. Want to see how quick and easy these pieces are to build?

2255,657089364,"[' How much does WIK weigh? 45 grams = 1.6 ounces Fri, Jul 17 2020 3:56 pm EDT What materials are used to manufacture WIK? WIK’s housing is made from ABS plastic. I like it’s high durability and impact resistance. ABS also has excellent high and low temperature tolerance. The band is made using Cordura fabric. Wed, Jul 15 2020 11:54 pm EDT How many lumens does WIK have? WIK is an ambient light so it’s lumen output is a little difficult to quantify. I measured about 60 lumens at the source. One of my favorite features of WIK is that it will stay at that output for the entire use of the battery. No dimming. Wed, Jul 15 2020 11:54 pm EDT How many charge cycles will WIK’s battery support? WIK uses a lithium ion battery which typically gets anywhere from 300-500 charge cycles. We have taken steps to protect the battery by lowering the charge rate and not letting the battery’s voltage get to low before shutting off. We think this will give WIK a higher than average number of charge cycles. Wed, Jul 15 2020 11:54 pm EDT Does WIK come in a smaller size? Yes. A regular size and a smaller size. Regular will fist most people comfortably. I recommend the smaller size for Kids. A survey will go out to all the backers with the information needed to select size and color.

This will not have any health effects on people including children. Fri, Jul 3 2020 4:07 am EDT Are children able to assemble Armpal? Children can assemble Armpal with their parents. But we recommend that children over 10 years old try to complete it independently, which will be a great exercise for hands-on ability and concentration.

Fri, Jul 3 2020 4:07 am EDT Will the assembled Armpal take up a lot of space? No, according to our calculations, an assembled Armpal needs 400mm*240mm or 200mm*650mm space to place. You can easily place it on your desk or bookshelf as a handmade artwork. Fri, Jul 3 2020 4:07 am EDT Do I need to prepare some special tools to assemble? No glue is needed for putting an Armpal together.

Sat, Jul 4 2020 2:29 pm EDT Will the game be available in other languages? Compared with other traditional board games, our game has no textual content.

Players take turns asking others for a specific card in order to fill out their ""book"". If their request is successful, they get to ask again. It gets especially fun as you figure out who has what card based on what each player has asked. Our 7 year old is remarkably good at it. Wed, Dec 28 2016 6:36 pm EST What is the goal of the Kickstarter Project? Thanks for your interest. I just want to generate enough interest to successfully fund a higher volume printing of the cards (100) to bring it down to a reasonable price. The first set I had printed last week was $23 after shipping. Humbug is a fun game that my kids and I play. Our 7th grader took a deck to school a couple of months ago and her science teacher was really interested, so I made them a few decks with our printer. A home-made set just doesn\'t shuffle and feel as good as a professionally made set. With a successful kickstarter campaign, I would have enough to produce the 100 decks...after those are sold, I would have enough revenue to produce 250 and then hopefully can perpetuate the concept.

2273,1569778596,"[' What exactly is The Biomech Encyclopedia? The Biomech Encyclopedia will be a large format hardbound book, 10x13"", either one really thick volume or two smaller volumes in a slipcase, depending on how much money is raised. It will explore the abstract realm of biomechanical art, including many instructional feature articles by a variety of artists, a photo gallery of tattoo work by our long list of contributing artists, a biomechanical painting gallery, and a massive section of fully realized biomechanical art done in collaboration by dozens of artists through a private online gallery, exploring every nook and cranny of this genre from the robotic to the geometric to the organic to the alien mutant, and everything in between. Thu, Dec 14 2017 4:01 pm EST What is the biomechanical style? Imagine the mechanics of biology; the way that living things grow, move and evolve. Picture also the textures and details of not only the organic biological world but the industrial one as well, and then imagine the different ways these elements could be mixed, fused and contrasted against each other. This gives you an idea of the abstract art realm that we are exploring in The Biomech Encyclopedia. This genre was popularized by the great Swiss artist H.R. Giger when he designed the creature and sets for the original Ridley Scott film Alien. Since then it has become popular with tattoo artists, fantasy artists, filmmakers, creature designers, game programmers and many other drivers of our modern culture. Thu, Dec 14 2017 4:01 pm EST When will the Biomech Encyclopedia be available? The layout and design work for The Biomech Encyclopedia is well under way, with plans to send it off to the printer around the end of February. Printing and shipping turnover is typically four months, so we expect to have the book in hand early summer of 2018. Thu, Dec 14 2017 4:01 pm EST Who is publishing The Biomech Encyclopedia? The Biomech Encyclopedia is being published by Proton Press, run by veteran tattoo artists Guy Aitchison and Michele Wortman. Proton Press has been a mainstay in the tattoo community for fifteen years, with titles such as Guy Aitchison\'s Organica and Reinventing The Tattoo, Michele\'s Moments Of Epiphany, Nick Baxter\'s Sharp Focus Realism in Oil, and the tattoo community group projects Innerstate and Scratch Art. You can find many of these books at www.hyperspacestudios.com or at Guy\'s educational site, www.tattooeducation.com. Thu, Dec 14 2017 4:01 pm EST Who is Guy Aitchison? Guy Aitchison began tattooing in 1988, gaining international recognition through a series of magazine articles early in his career. In 1992 he held his first educational seminar and began publishing small educational volumes along with the seminars. Since then he has been involved in the educational end of tattooing, producing a variety of videos and books including his flagship educational product, Reinventing The Tattoo, which can be found at www.reinventingthetattoo.com. You can see his most current work at his Instagram profile, @guyaitchisonart. He runs a private studio in Southern Illinois along with his partner Michele Wortman and their daughter Kaia Rose. Thu, Dec 14 2017 4:01 pm EST Who is The Biomech Encyclopedia intended for? The Biomech Encyclopedia is meant for tattooists, painters, filmmakers, special effects artists, game designers, creature makers, and anyone who enjoys art on any level. It will be a feast for the eyes as well as a treasure trove of instructional information. Thu, Dec 14 2017 4:01 pm EST Is it possible to make more than one pledge, so that I can receive multiple reward packages? The simplest way would be to figure out the total amount for your multiple pledges, add to your existing pledge in order to total that amount (or, if you haven\'t pledged yet, make a pledge for that amount), and then to send Guy a message (best way is through his @guyaitchisonart Instagram profile, or to email his manager at customerservice.hyperspace@gmail.com) and let him know which packages this money is for. They will contact you with a confirmation before sending out your rewards. The other thing you could try is to use a different email address for each pledge, which the grapevine says should work.

Like most games, you can set the difficulty level of Quell and adjust this as you progress. The Gauntlet is fully adjustable comes with a range of resistance bands that let you tune the force and resistance profile to your personal requirements. This means you can start at the level that’s right for you and take it from there! Fri, Aug 28 2020 12:59 pm EDT Is Quell safe? Yes! We’ve designed the Gauntlet to be totally safe for all our users. Quell provides regular guidance and feedback on your form via our high-accuracy motion tracking. Additionally, unlike traditional shadowboxing, the Gauntlet prevents hyperextension when throwing straight strikes and thereby prevents this type of injury as well. Fri, Aug 28 2020 12:59 pm EDT I don’t have any boxing experience. Can I still play Quell? Quell can be enjoyed by anyone, regardless of prior boxing experience! We'll be including lots of tutorials on proper technique, and our motion tracking enables us to provide players guidance on their form. This has been carefully designed to teach our players the foundations of proper boxing technique and prevent any injuries. Fri, Aug 28 2020 12:57 pm EDT Do I need anything else to get started with Quell? No—you only need the Gauntlet and your laptop, phone or tablet to play, so you’ll always be ready for a session. Fri, Aug 28 2020 12:58 pm EDT What platforms is Quell launching on? We’re launching on PC, Mac and mobile devices. We’re also actively pursuing other platforms like VR and consoles that we want to support after our initial launch. Fri, Aug 28 2020 12:58 pm EDT Do I need to set up a camera or other device to play? Nope! All motion tracking is achieved using sensors in the Gauntlet, so all you have to do is slip it on, connect to the game and get started. It’s that simple. Fri, Aug 28 2020 12:58 pm EDT What if I just want to have a quick workout without playing through the story? Good news! Quell has several modes beyond the main story, including customisable training sessions that let you jump straight into the action whenever the feeling strikes you. Fri, Aug 28 2020 12:58 pm EDT What about sweat/is the Gauntlet washable? The Gauntlet can (and should!) be washed, either by hand or in the washing machine—using a gentle cycle will ensure that it stays fresh and in good condition for your next session.

Fri, Aug 28 2020 12:58 pm EDT Will the Gauntlet be available in different sizes? Yes! Better yet, the Gauntlet is designed to be highly adjustable, meaning that our sizes work for a broad range of body types.

It’s our way of giving back to the Kickstarter community. Fri, Aug 28 2020 12:58 pm EDT How much will Quell+ cost? Although we haven't settled on an exact price yet, we can say with certainty that it won't cost more than you're typical Netflix/Spotify subscription. Fri, Sep 18 2020 7:30 am EDT Can multiple users play with the same Gauntlet and account? They certainly can! You can start multiple saves with the same account on Quell, and use the same Gauntlet as these are not tied to the account. Each user will require a Quell+ account to gain access to our ongoing content releases. Mon, Aug 31 2020 9:06 am EDT Can I purchase multiple copies of the Early Bird reward tier? You can.

Classic vs Pastel: typically the classic version of a pin has brighter colors and a black nickel finish (black lines), while the pastel versions have alternative colors (usually more pastel/light, sometimes they have alt hair colors), and they typically deploy a complementary metal finish (gold line art). Sun, Jun 16 2019 1:35 pm EDT I pledged for x pins as an early bird but I want more, what should I do? Go to the main kickstarter page, and you\'ll see a ""manage pledge"" button on the top right. Click that to increase your tier if you need to.  If the next slot of early birds is taken up, send me a message and I will open another slot for you -- after all, you should get to keep your early bird pricing! Sun, Jun 16 2019 1:35 pm EDT Say I get more than one pin, and I want some classic, and some in pastel -- is it possible? Yes! You can mix and match color options. There will be choices for this on the surveys that come out after the campaign. :) Sun, Jun 16 2019 1:35 pm EDT How do I get add-ons? Go to the main kickstarter page, and you\'ll see a ""manage pledge"" button on the top right. Click that to add additional dollars to your pledge that match the prices in the ""add ons shop"" section of the main kickstarter page. Sun, Jun 16 2019 1:35 pm EDT Will I be able to get add ons after the campaign is over? Most likely, yes.  They will either be up for pre-order, or will go up on my shop.  But pledging to the campaign is the fastest way to get it -- Kickstarter backers are priority 1 in terms of getting their stuff the fastest.  :) Sun, Jun 16 2019 1:38 pm EDT ?  ']",6

2342,1702780716,"["" Hey, what about the motorcycle parking? The parklet is replacing a car space, and the motorcycle parking is turning into bicycle parking, roughly. We (DNA) actually petitioned to get those 6 metered motorcycle spaces installed, way back when. But then in the intervening decade, the Cycle Gear motorcycle shop moved in right across the street from us, and they installed eighteen *free* motorcycle spaces on Harrison at 11th. They're literally 50 feet away. Once the parklet is installed, if it turns out that the difference between 18 and 24 motorcycle spots on the same block is actually significant, we'll start the process of turning another car space into metered motorcycle parking. We'll see! Many members of our staff ride motorcycles, so we'll know right away. Trying to roll this change into the parklet permitting process at the beginning likely would have delayed the whole project by another year. The bureaucracy is even more horrible than you can imagine. Wed, Jul 31 2013 2:13 pm EDT What about smoking? It's illegal to smoke with 15' of the entrance of a business, and the parklet is within that distance of the restaurant, so there will be no smoking in the parklet. And yes, we will be enforcing this. Wed, Jul 31 2013 2:13 pm EDT Can I drink a beer outside? Sorry, no. The parklet is not a part of the restaurant, it's technically a public park. And it's illegal to drink in public parks (ha ha, right). But more importantly, you'd get us in trouble for it, so no booze in the parklet. Wed, Jul 31 2013 2:13 pm EDT But I can eat there, right? Absolutely! You can sit out there and enjoy the day with your food and non-alcoholic beverages, whether purchased from DNA Pizza or from somewhere else. The parklet will be available to everybody.

Connecting the internet, cellular networks and land lines, in person interviews and on the street dialogue, and the written word together in a live experience for us all to enjoy. So what's it about?  Everything that we talk and think about, unfiltered and unedited, real people with ideas and opinions sharing with the world. Sat, Nov 9 2013 11:03 am EST How much is a good donation? Any amount is great!  Your donations to this project can help bring people together, and will establish a place for us all to connect and make a difference! Sun, Nov 17 2013 11:39 am EST What will happen if the funds exceed the goal? The goal amount will get this show running very strong online and will allow me to open all the doors of communication needed to effectively run a show of the highest quality. Any additional funds will be put towards reaching out further on the internet and potentially AM and FM broadcasting, XM and satellite and so on.  The sky is truly the limit, and your donations can make connecting with the world through more expensive and traditional radio methods possible. Sat, Nov 9 2013 11:11 am EST What are some of the ways I will be able to participate? Here's a short list of the ways I will be taking calls and getting people onto the show: If more funding comes through more ways to talk live on the show will be added. Sat, Nov 9 2013 11:20 am EST Are you offering advertising time slots? Yes!  Part of my donation rewards are dedicated and regular time for advertisements.  After the show is live the price of advertising slots will have to go up, this is a great time to get a deal on getting your product or business out there! Sat, Nov 9 2013 11:23 am EST ?  ""]",5

The artists passed away more than 70 years ago and, for the vast majority of countries, their copyright expires after that period of time.

With over 144 Tokens printed in the first project and up to 180 planned for Classic Art Tokens: Marble Edition, there is a very good chance that we have either made the Token you are interested in already, possibly with multiple variations, or it will be included in this project.  We want to make all of those obscure, never-before-seen-in-print Tokens a reality just as much as you.  The best way to make it happen?

Your message then gets stored next to your name on our Backers List, so nothing escapes our attention.

Rflow extracts the warm air you exhale through the silver ion filter in the valve.  The silver ion filter cleans and purifies the air. It is also very efficient at eliminating the bacteria and impeding growth of microbes like spores, fungi and viruses - it destroys bacteria cell’s inside configuration and absorbs cell’s elements in order to make sure that the bacteria cells will not harm the air around it.

Die Auswahl treffen wir erst, nachdem wir die Protagonisten, deren Geschichte passend und spannend finden, persönlich getroffen haben. Geschichten können oft spannend sein, das heißt aber noch nicht, dass die jeweiligen Protagonisten vor der Kamera funktionieren. Wir werden euch als Community aber auf jeden Fall so gut es geht in die Auswahl einbeziehen. Thu, Jun 27 2019 6:04 am EDT Was ist für euch ein Wiener Original? Diese Frage haben wir eifrig diskutiert. Dürfen es nur gebürtige Wiener sein? Müssen sie ein gewisses Alter haben? Ein Versuch: Potenzielle Protagonisten müssen ein spannendes Hobby oder Beruf haben. Sie müssen als Charaktere außergewöhnlich sein, sei es schrullig, witzig, charmant, auf jeden Fall etwas eigen. Je außergewöhnlicher die Stories sind, desto besser natürlich. Und was uns auch noch wichti ist: Wir wollen die unbekannten Originale vor den Vorhang holen, Michi Häupl und Co wurden ausreichend portraitiert. In der Nationalität schränken wir unserer Definition nach allerdings nicht ein. Ein super-exzentrischer Kebap-Standler ist genauso ein Wiener Original wie ein Taxler, Kellner oder Müllmann.

If you\'re not interested in watching the video, here it is in a nutshell: go to the green ""Manage Your Pledge"" button at the top right of this page, and click it. You can then add any dollar amount you like to your existing pledge and devote that to whatever items you find on our Add On sheet, which have corresponding amounts next to them. Once the campaign is over, we\'ll send all our Backers a survey for them to fill out and tell us exactly what items they want us to send. Done! Wed, May 6 2015 5:03 pm EDT How do I tell you what items I pledged for? Once the campaign ends, we\'ll send out surveys to our Backers through Backerkit, a fulfillment company we\'ve used for each of our campaigns. With the survey, you\'ll be able to select each reward item you\'d like your pledge money spent on, and even add funds if you want to purchase more. Sun, May 10 2015 7:28 pm EDT Hey, you\'ve got more than one deck unlocked and I\'ve pledged for more than one deck. Can I spread my multiple deck order over the different decks? Absolutely! At the end of the campaign, each unlocked deck will be available for our Backers. If you\'ve pledged for one, you\'ll be able to use your Backerkit survey to choose which deck you\'d like. If you\'ve pledged for three decks and three decks are available, you can get one of each or two of one and one of another or three of one kind, etc. BUT (and that\'s a big but) we aren\'t going to allow a Backer who\'s pledged for a half brick, brick or more to mix up the order too much. So, half brick and brick orders will likely be split into ""2+2+2"" or ""3+3"" and ""4+4+4"" and ""6+6"" orders, and so on. No ""7 of one kind and 2 of another and 3 of another"" - sometimes a Backer\'s math won\'t add up and other times we just have to create so many new sku\'s to deal with the different combinations that it causes too chaos for us to effectively fulfill everyone\'s rewards in time.

We find that both work well on our end! We will also combine your items when it comes time to ship. All you need to do is send us a message from your primary account and let us know which levels/accounts are yours. Sun, Aug 27 2017 5:45 pm EDT The piece I want has already been backed. Do you have another one? Each of my pieces are unique. However, there is always the chance that I have something similar in stock or coming up. To find out, message me directly with the pledge level and campaign number. I will check my pieces and get back to you. Sun, Aug 27 2017 5:45 pm EDT You don\'t have any descriptions of your items. Why not and how do I learn more? Kickstarter only allows us a certain amount of characters when creating a project, and we often exceed the limit. We\'re working on ways to get around this without cutting down the rewards. Until we find a work-around and you\'re seeking a more information about a piece, feel free to visit our website where there are descriptions of most of the woods we use - just click on the picture of the bowl you like and a new tab will open up. You can also ask us directly, and we\'d be happy to let you know! Sun, Aug 27 2017 5:45 pm EDT Are your bowls food-safe? This is a question we get a lot! While the answer is yes, please note that they are not specifically made for food use and will lose the shine you see in the photo if used as such. Bowls may also have naturally occurring cracks or voids that may make them unsuitable for food usage. Sun, Aug 27 2017 5:45 pm EDT I want to use my bowl for food. Does it matter what ""finish"" is on my bowl? Any of the bowls are able to hold food (but be aware of through-holes and splits as these are not good for food service) and can get wet but it could affect the finish depending on which type you get. If you are looking for a bowl solely for food use, I would suggest the tool or the rustic finish. Over time with continued use, the bowl will begin to take on its own patina. The G+ finish (while food-safe) is not recommended for food use as it will lose the shine you\'ll see when you first receive it. Sun, Aug 27 2017 5:45 pm EDT How do I wash the bowl if I\'m using it for food? You can hand wash the bowls with soap and water but don\'t let it soak. Let it air dry, and you\'ll be good to go. Do not put the bowl in the dishwasher! Sun, Aug 27 2017 5:45 pm EDT Do you make custom items? All my bowls are custom made! But if you mean will I make something according to your specifics, the answer is no. If there is something you’re interested in in particular (wood, shape, size), feel free to let me know. What I can do is keep an eye out as I work and if I have something come along that fits the bill, I will let you know. Sun, Aug 27 2017 5:45 pm EDT Why is the international shipping so expensive for some of the bowls? USPS first class international shipping only allows us to send a package up to 4 pounds and costs up to about $50. When over 4 pounds, the shipping shifts to USPS Priority International, which can run between $50 - $80 depending on the weight of the package, the size of the package and the recipient location. Sun, Aug 27 2017 5:45 pm EDT Why do international backers have to pay have to pay customs fees? Isn’t this considered a gift? According to the Kickstarter rules and regulations, back and then receiving an item from a campaign is not considered a gift; it is merchandise. Then in compliance with the United States Postal Service International Shipping rules and regulations, we must legally claim the items as merchandise and include the actual price on the customs declaration form. To not do so would be considered fraud. Unfortunately for some of our international backers, there are a few countries that will apply an additional customs and/or postal fee, which is the responsibility of the backer. Sun, Aug 27 2017 5:45 pm EDT If I buy a bowl as a gift for someone else, will you send it directly to them? Absolutely! You’ll be able to choose the address in the survey at the completion of the project. Also, please send me a message just so I know this is the case. Sun, Aug 27 2017 5:45 pm EDT What is ikebana? Ikebana is the Japanese art of flower arranging, which can be further defined as ""a disciplined art form in which the arrangement is a living thing where nature and humanity are brought together"" according to Ikebana International. (http://www.ikebanahq.org/whatis.php) Sun, Aug 27 2017 5:45 pm EDT How do the flowers stay in the ikebana vase? Ikebana arranging uses a kenzan, or spiky frog, which is a heavy lead dish with affixed spikes to hold the flowers. Each of my ikebana levels will come with a kenzan. Sun, Aug 27 2017 5:45 pm EDT So when you find a piece of wood, do you make your bowls out of it immediately? Don\'t I wish! Bowls made out of “green” wood cannot be sanded smooth and often warp and crack. In addition, a “gallery quality” finish is not possible on wet wood. I shape each bowl from the “green” wood and coat each “bowl blank” with wax. The blanks are then put in my “bowl garages” and stored for a year or more. This process stabilizes the wood by allowing it to dry slowly and release the tensions in the wood. If the bowl blank survives intact, I then put it back on the lathe and “finish turn” it into it\'s final shape. This process ensures the completed bowl will not warp or crack as is common for bowls turned from “green” wood. Sun, Aug 27 2017 5:45 pm EDT How do you begin a project? I choose the “bowl blanks” suitable for the designs to be offered as the rewards. The blanks are finished into the completed rewards as described above. I complete many of the bowls in the weeks before the project launches to make sure the forms I want can be completed from the bowl blanks I have chosen. After the campaign is complete, I mark the bowls and ship them off to their new homes! Sun, Aug 27 2017 5:45 pm EDT ?  ']",14

2504,1238611467,"["" What made you think if ever using clothespins? It all started in 2002 when I made a dress out of clothespins for my best friend. Lacking time, funds and any knowledge about making clothing, I went to a Dollar Store in Miami Beach and that was it. Sort of a joke, in turned into an ongoing series of art that does not seem to have a end. Thu, Mar 21 2013 3:53 pm EDT How long does it take to make something like this? That is hard to judge. Needless to say, I have become very fast through the years but still, it is labor intensive and requires of my natural patience. The most tedious part of the process is drilling 2 holes on each of the thousands of clothespins. No one seems to be as fast as I, thus I do it all myself. Then I create sections that are later connected and so forth. In between I work on other things, sculptures, paintings or house chores as needed. This particular project has very little time to complete and ship to the location so I will be testing all that I have learned in the past few years. The installation is always the most exciting and rewarding part of the project, making it all worth it. Thu, Mar 21 2013 3:53 pm EDT What is the largest piece you ever made out of clothespins? Not large in size but in numbers, the one I did for SCULPTED GREEN exhibition at the City of Bellevue WA City Hall in 2008. It was made of about 12 thousand wood clothespins. Largest in size, the one at The Hive dinning hall at the Savannah College of Art & Design with a combined length of over 60'.

Please be aware that returns or refunds are not available on this Kickstarter campaign promotion Mon, Feb 24 2020 12:17 pm EST What is waist training? Waist training is a healthy process of shrinking your waist size by wearing a natural rubber latex waist trainer,. When wearing it daily, a waist trainer will gradually reshape your waist into an hourglass figure by compressing and repositioning your body fat. Also known as waist cinching, this practice came to prominence during Victorian times and has remained relevant because of it's proven results. They need to be worn 4-6 hours a day, and be very tight. The compression also reduces hunger since they are tight, and they help improve posture and back pain as well. In mordern days people inherited this technique but improved it to provide a more comfortable expereince. After 30 days you will notice a significant difference in your mid section. Our customers have dropped  2-3 dress sizes in this timeframe. Mon, Feb 24 2020 12:17 pm EST How do I choose the correct size waist trainer? The most reliable method to choosing the correct size waist trainer is to measure your waist right above your navel and refer to the size chart to find the corresponding size. You can also go by height/and weight, but keep in mind that this is a general method only since we all hold our weight differently. We recommend measuring. If you are in doubt, or between sizes, choose one size up. Our waist trainers are meant to fit very tight, and may need help getting it on the first time until it breaks in a bit. If you need help choosing a size, please email us at support@lissommex.com  or visit this page http://www.lissommex.com/index.php?route=information/information&information_id=9 Mon, Feb 24 2020 12:17 pm EST CanI wear it if I am allergic to rubber? Even though we use the best quality natural rubber in the market to reduce the risk of allergy. If you have been diagnosed with a rubber or latex allergy, we don’t recommend that you buy it Sat, Feb 29 2020 9:49 am EST Can I wear it for sports, fitness and everyday? Yes, LissommeX is suitable for three major use scenarios: daily wear can help correct posture and create an hourglass waist. Wearing it to protect your waist and abdomen when you workout. It can also be worn postpartum to help prevent internal organs from sagging. Mon, Feb 24 2020 12:17 pm EST What are the advantages of 15 strands? 9 strands focus on shaping, but they are prone to folds when worn for a long time, which affects comfort. 25 strands reduce wrinkles, but they are insufficient in shaping and the waist curve is not obvious enough. The 15 strands selected by Lissommex have better support and do not affect the comfort, less prone to wrinkles, better support in the front abdomen, and do not affect the hourglass effect. Sat, Feb 29 2020 9:49 am EST Will my chest be squeezed? No. LissommeX adopts a unique chest support design, and the unique chest curve design perfectly fits the chest shape. We calculated the perfect length- long enough to cover your skin, but not so long that it will poke into your chest. Sat, Feb 29 2020 9:49 am EST Do you feel stuffy when you wear it? No, our invisible mesh provides a vapor barrier, which allows sweat to wick away. Sat, Feb 29 2020 9:49 am EST ?  ""]",10

2571,1353140717,"[' What is mead? In its \'purest\' form, mead is simply honey diluted in water and fermented. Sat, Jul 14 2018 10:58 pm EDT What else can mead be made with? First off, to be mead, the fermented sugar must come from honey.  Aside from that, the honey may be mixed with water in its most basic form, or fruit juice may be used. Any fruit used other than apple or grapes, produces what is known as \'melomel.\' Sat, Jul 14 2018 10:58 pm EDT What is mead called if you make it with apple juice or grapes then?  Cider and mead wine? Glad you asked~!  Mead made with apple juice or cider, is called \'Cyser.\'  I prefer the Latin pronunciation for this which sounds like \'Kaiser.\'   If grapes are used, you will produce mead known as \'pyment.\' Cyser has a definite cider flavor to it and pyment does taste more like wine to the pallet.  For this reason, I don\'t make pyment as being a bit of a mead-pusher, I find it confuses people when they taste something that is supposed to be so different from wine and yet tastes like wine. Sat, Jul 14 2018 10:58 pm EDT What makes mead so different from wine if they can taste the same? Wine is defined as an alcoholic beverage produced by fermenting plant fruit or parts.  Mead is made by fermenting an insect product, honey.  The dry variety of mead can taste very much like a white wine. Wed, Jul 18 2018 4:37 am EDT Why is mead called honey wine? The term honey wine is misappropriated from the term \'honeyed-wine.\'  Honeyed-wine refers to wine to which honey has been added to sweeten it.  This was a practice done in Italy during the Renaissance period to make the dry wines of the court more palatable for the ladies of the court.  Over time and with first disuse and then misuse, the term has changed to honey wine in referring to mead.  Mead is no more wine, than wine is beer or beer a distilled spirit.   There is no proper Federal definition for mead specifically. Sat, Jul 14 2018 10:58 pm EDT Why is mead considered a wine? Mead should not be considered a wine any more than wine should be considered a distilled spirit.  By Federal Law, alcoholic beverages fall into one of three categories: beer if produced with the addition of hops and grains (hops specifically), wine if the fermented product is plant parts or fruit, or distilled spirits if the alcohol is produced by distillation. Mead is produced by fermenting an insect product.  What can confuse the issue is if grapes are used to make a pyment mead, or using hops to make a braggot mead. Wed, Jul 18 2018 4:37 am EDT What is braggot mead? Mead can be made by flavoring it with fruits, herbs, spices, hops, grains, etc.  Using apples will produce cyser as noted above, but when hops are used to flavor mead during fermentation, what is produced is a mead called braggot.  This type of mead as a decided \'ale\' flavor. For this reason, while there is absolutely nothing wrong with making mead in this fashion, I leave this flavor for others to produce as we rather promote a strikingly different flavor in our mead rather than make a product easily confused with the ordinary palate of flavors.  Beer lovers will certainly find this type of mead very familiar in the same way people that prefer wine will like pyment as it tastes much more like a typical wine. Sat, Jul 14 2018 10:58 pm EDT Have you mispelled \'days\' in your brand name? Great Question~!  When we asked Philip this question, he pointed out that few ask it.  He wanted to answer it himself so....Philip? "" \'Roman Daze\' was coined as my brand a very long time ago.  There is a funny story that goes along with it and I am sure it will be told many times in the meadery.  I won\'t get into that here so let me just say this.  The recipe I used for my first batch of mead was a 2000 year old recipe I had researched.  After applying some modern science and techniques, I produced a mead that is most pleasant to drink and seemingly innocent in effects when drank while seated...until one stood up!  Some called it \'dazzling,\' some simply said they felt \'dazed,\' so as a nod to the source, I like the play on words."" Sun, Jul 15 2018 3:45 pm EDT What makes Roman Daze mead different from other meads I can find? There are a number of things we can point to but if we have to pick one, it would be that our mead is a stronger mead than what is commonly found. To make such strong mead takes a lot of honey, up to three times more honey than it takes to make mead like many of the others available on the market.  That is only the first part, making the alcohol.  Once this level of alcohol is produced, it must be balanced by the honey so that a pleasing drink is the result. Wed, Jul 18 2018 4:37 am EDT Why do you make such strong mead? To make sack requires a lot of experience and know how.  There are many difficulties that must be overcome when making sack.  If you read about the process online, you will find many sources say to produce a mead in excess of 12% alcohol is not possible.  This is because of the difficulties involved and the general lack of expertise people making mead have.  It has taken a long time for Philip to get to the level of expertise he has so as to perfect the process of making sack.  As it is a variety of mead not commonly found, he prefers to make it. Mead can be made in a great range in both sweetness and level of alcohol.  There are three types of mead generally and the classification is directly related to the level of alcohol found in the mead. Hydromel- this is best compared to a high density beer or hard cider for the level of alcohol.  This is typically the least sweet, or \'driest\' of the meads you will generally find. Standard- most comparable to table wine.  Most meads in this range will be finished like a dry white wine with a tendency to the dry end of sweetness. Sack- Generally best compared to a Port wine or dessert wine.  These are the sweetest of the meads you will find as the extra honey is required to mask the otherwise strong alcohol bite which without a good balanced finish, is very distasteful.  Alcohol level can be as high as 22-25%.  Philip likes to produce mead in the 16-18% range as they are strong, but not so strong as to be reduced to drinking shots.  He still promotes a full horn to enjoy the mead Daze~! Wed, Jul 18 2018 4:37 am EDT I am new to mead.  When I look to buy a bottle, I get a little sticker shock at the price sometime. Why does mead cost so much? Good question and one that history rather addresses.   Until the art of fermentation was understood, mead was pretty much the only alcoholic beverage available and its production was attributed to the gods.  After fermentation was understood, wine began to supplant mead in availability and use simply because grapes are cheaper to use in the process than honey. Once distilled spirits came on the scene, mead disappeared from preference after thousands of years.  It was cheaper to produce a higher level of alcohol by distillation and people moved to \'the-bigger-bang for their buck \' for simple economic reasons. Mead is seeing a new return to favor but the base materials are still more expensive to produce it.  The process also takes longer than beer or distilled spirits.  The struggle the bees have been facing for the last ten years has also driven the price of honey up, hence driving the price up additionally. Wed, Jul 18 2018 4:37 am EDT I have heard mead is the oldest alcoholic beverage known to man.  Why is it just now becoming known? For millennia mead was the only alcoholic beverage, this is true.  It fell out of vogue due to more cheaply produced and stronger drink coming available with the advent of distilled spirits. It has been out of circulation for several hundred years and today it has a very different taste from what we otherwise have available to drink and for that reason many people are moving to mead as a choice simply because it is something different and \'new.\'  There are a few other reasons... Wed, Jul 18 2018 4:37 am EDT What is another reason for the rise in meads new found popularity? The alcohol carried into your system by mead has a very different effect on the body.  All other alcohol is absorbed thru the intestines, then into the bloodstream and filtered by the liver and kidneys before it may be generally felt.  This may take 30-45 minutes.   The human body reacts to mead as the perfect food because of the honey it contains, which -is- the perfect food.  Honey is the only food which is absorbed into the body directly thru the stomach lining.  From there it enters the bloodstream and the first stop is...the brain. The effect of having had 4-6 ounces of mead can be felt in as little as 10 minutes. Sun, Jul 15 2018 2:07 am EDT I understand you make strong mead.   I have had some of it and it truly is quite powerful.  I haven\'t had one of your horns of mead yet, what kind of hangover does it deliver? Naturally, everyone is different.  Not being chemists or biologists, we asked this question of Philip as he is both.  His response was simple~ ""Most of the hangover from drinking too much beer comes from the additives, including formaldehyde, in the beer.  Dehydration also is a major factor.  Roman Daze mead contains no chemical additives, no stabilizers, and no preservatives.  It is a totally natural product.  We encourage responsible drinking and as with all alcoholic beverages, know your limits.  Off the record- should you overindulge, you may find when you wake up, the greatest desire you may have is to have something to drink.  Everyone metabolizes alcohol and sugar differently so I can\'t speak for you and your results unless I know you.  I can tell you this- you shouldn\'t get a sour stomach from mead unless it has additives in it or your body has trouble with sugars.  That being said, everyone is different, so I can\'t say.  I will tell you this~  don\'t drink a full horn of our mead alone~!  You may end up spilling a good share of it and it is always more fun to share it with a friend~!"" Sun, Jul 15 2018 2:07 am EDT I consider myself to be somewhat of a mead-snob.  Roman Daze mead is distinctly different from nearly every other mead I have had.  What makes your mead so darn good? Thank you for that comment~ and question.  We asked Philip this question and he said you have cut to the chase.  What you have asked gets to what he considers \'trade secrets\' and unless you are making a batch of mead with him he isn\'t inclined to answer in print. Philip has also written a book detailing his process and he would rather you read all he has to say about it rather than take a simple answer and think that was all there was to it. One thing we can tell you is that we use a hot cooking technique in making our mead as Philip knows the secret to getting the subtle flavors our of our ingredients.  Other than this, there are a number of other things we do in handling our ingredients, as well as our process that contribute to making our mead.  Philip also has an old world palate when it comes to finishing his mead.  Rather than finish it to taste like a dry white wine, Philip finishes it to have a distinctly different mouthfeel and balance.  He has an adage we use around the meadery...\'it the honey isn\'t in the nose and the finish, its not mead.\' Wed, Jul 18 2018 4:37 am EDT How do you make your mead so sparkling clear?  It looks alive in the glass~!  Do you use force filtration? This is another question we had to put to Philip for an answer.  Philip believes in ancient techniques and force filtration is a fairly new process to brewing.  When asked, Philip simply said, ""flocculation.  We use a characteristic of the yeast itself to clarify our mead.  Flocculation."" WELL...we hope you know what he is talking about because we don\'t know what the floc he is talking about...  8 )  Pardon our pun, he assured us it is quite particulate.  At least we think that is what he said. Sun, Jul 15 2018 2:27 am EDT So you don\'t use force filtration to clarify your mead.  Why not? Another good technical question.  Philip, will you please answer this one? Philip~ \'Sure thing.  I am convinced that forced filtration removes certain subtle characteristics from mead that would otherwise contribute to such things as mouth feel, sweetness, palate, finish and bouquet.  My process is slower, no doubt, but the end result is obvious in the finished product.  I have a very sophisticated palate after making mead for over 30 years and force filtration simply takes too many \'essentials\' out of the mead with the particulates.  There is another way, one that has been used for millennia.  It may take longer, but if you want quality, sometimes you have to put a little patience into the product and let nature take its course.\' Sun, Jul 15 2018 2:27 am EDT I have been reading your FAQ\'s and find that most of your answers leave me with another question.  Am I missing something? When Philip read your question he chuckled.  Then he smirked and said, ""Thank you for your comment.  You aren\'t missing anything.  In fact, you are \'getting it.\'  A good instructor should always answer the question, but must encourage the student to listen, integrate, and think.  You are a good student and observant.  Do you know what mead made with herbs and spices is called?"" Sun, Jul 15 2018 3:50 pm EDT Okay...Cyser~ apple mead, Pyment~ grape mead, Braggot~ hopped mead, Fruits~ melomel mead, Sack~ Strong mead...so what is mead called if you make it with herbs and spices? We are glad you asked.  Actually our most popular recipe we grabbed from Philip\'s nearly 20 year old recipe he has been calling \'Newton\'s Fall\',  It is made with Apple blossoms, rose hips, roasted chicory, and hibiscus.  This style of mead, flavored with herbs and spices before fermentation, is called a metheglin.  Philip tells us he had some unexpected visitors after he posted on social media he was making meth-eglin~!   DOH! Sun, Jul 15 2018 2:50 am EDT Why is your mead so sweet? The quick answer is it has honey in it.  A lot of it.   A more thorough answer would be that compared to the mead you may have had before, most of our recipes produce sack which contains much more alcohol than other types of mead.  Without a sweet finish, the level of alcohol present is generally unpleasant to taste. Sun, Jul 15 2018 2:50 am EDT ?  ']",20

Rocketbook Everlast is available on this Kickstarter campaign. The Rocketbook Wave can is not endlessly reusable (reusing 5-20 times is realistic).  The Rocketbook Everlast is endlessly reusable (reusing over 1000 times is realistic). Both the Rocketbook Wave and Rocketbook Everlast work with Pilot FriXion pens. The Rocketbook Wave can be reused by heating in your microwave oven. The Rocketbook Everlast can be reused by wiping the page clean with a moist towel. Don't put the Everlast in the microwave. The binding and the cover of the Everlast are more durable since it's design isn't constrained to microwavable materials. The Rocketbook Wave pages are a cellulose formulation. The Rocketbook Everlast pages are made of a waterproof synthetic poly blend. Fri, Nov 18 2016 10:30 am EST Can I heat the Everlast notebook to erase it? Erase your Everlast by applying moisture and wiping it off. The Rocketbook Wave (available at GetRocketbook.com) is designed to be microwave safe, so you can erase the whole notebook with heat in the microwave (or use a strong hairdryer, page by page) When you reuse the Rocketbook Wave, slight residue from clear ink remains on the page, so it's not endlessly reusable like the Everlast is. We customers who tell us that they use the Rocketbook Wave over 20 times but we say it's good for 5 uses to set expectations modest. The Rocketbook Everlast is really an endlessly reusable Rocketbook. Fri, Nov 18 2016 10:32 am EST What if I leave ink on the page for a long time? We tested ink on left on the page for 3 months, 2 months, 1 month, 3 weeks, 2 weeks, 1 week. When ink was left on the page for 2 months or more, the writing left behind a very subtle ghosting. You really have to be in good light and look very closely to notice it. It doesn't interfere with writing over it, future reusability, or scanning. After ink is left on the page for 1 month or less, erasing was perfect and the page was pristine. Fri, Nov 18 2016 10:32 am EST Will moisture degrade the pages? The Everlast pages are a sythnetic poly blend that are impervious to water. Fri, Nov 18 2016 10:32 am EST Will my notes wipe off easily? Dry ink cures great to the page and won't wipe off the page.  Introduce some water (a moist towel is recommended), and it will wipe off easily and perfectly. Fri, Nov 18 2016 10:40 am EST Where can I find replacement Pilot FriXion pens? Your Rocketbook Everlast comes with one FriXion pen and we offer add-ons of 3 packs for convenience. But you don't need to buy replacements from us. FriXion pens are made by Pilot and are available in many stores, like Staples, Walmart, Target, and Amazon.com (http://amzn.to/2eNPYCs) Fri, Nov 18 2016 10:40 am EST I'm left handed, anything I should know? If your hand tends to drag across your words as you write, then the Everlast is not for you. When writing with FriXion gel inks on the Everlast, it takes 10+ seconds for the ink to dry and be resistant to smudging. Also, if you don't like the coil on the left side of your book, then the Everlast might not be a good fit (yet).  In the future we may provide steno-style books that are bound at the top, but at this time we haven't committed to doing so. Mon, Nov 21 2016 10:48 am EST Do Frixion pens erase (with their eraser) on the Everlast? Absolutely. You can use the eraser on the Frixion pen to erase writing as you go.

However, if your jacket is incorrect in any way or needs some repair please contact us at info@dhana.com and we will correct any issues. Mon, Oct 14 2019 10:27 pm EDT Can you elaborate on the exterior shell of the memory jacket, what material is it? The outer fabric is made of deadstock. Deadstock is leftover material that did not get used for its intended purpose. Maybe too large of an order or was dyed the wrong color. This is unused quality fabric we divert from the landfill by giving it a second chance! In this case, the deadstock of the Circular Memory Jacket is made from polyester and fabric that is typically used for outerwear windbreakers. Mon, Oct 14 2019 10:27 pm EDT Is it machine-washable? We recommend dry clean only as it may have a mixture of materials and truly one of a kind designs. Mon, Oct 14 2019 10:27 pm EDT Can I mail in more than 10 pieces of garment? We suggest ten pieces as big as t-shirts. Mon, Oct 14 2019 10:27 pm EDT What's the shipping cost? For pledges in the US and Canada there is no shipping cost to deliver your “memory items”. However, for international shipping to all other countries a $50 shipping fee will be applied to cover the cost to have you mail us your items and send the final jacket your way.

To ensure that your message really gets to your friends, who are usually moving, we have developed very smart protocol with intelligent algorithms which double check the network delivering potential.

The Piss Pad is the first in-home diffusing target designed to put an end to urine splash-back. Tue, Jun 23 2020 9:25 am EDT Will it leave a mark on my toilet bowl? The Piss Pad uses a microsuction adhesive, which makes it very easy to install and remove without leaving any mark or residue. Sat, Aug 22 2020 4:32 am EDT Who’s pee did you use to make this video?

Luckily for you, the Piss Pad is rinsed with every flush. Because Piss Pad’s fibers are fully sealed, no smells or liquid can cling to its surface. When you do use a cleaner to scrub your toilet, simply spray the Pass Pad and flush :) Sat, Aug 22 2020 4:32 am EDT Is the Piss Pad easy to install? Very! Simply peel, place, and stick - installing and removing the Piss Pad is simple. Full installation instructions will be included when you receive your Piss Pad also  :) Sat, Aug 22 2020 4:32 am EDT Will the Piss Pad lose its stickiness in time and fall off? We've designed the Piss Pad with an incredible waterproof, microsuction adhesion. You can rest assured that the Piss Pad will stay anchored to the porcelain of your toilet. For installation, we recommend 6 hours of no toilet flushing so the microsuction can securely attach to the porcelain of the toilet. If you ever want to remove, simply peel it right back off. No residue left behind... Yeah, it's that easy... AND you can always reinstall. Just be sure to keep the microsuction waterproof adhesion away from dust and heat :) Sat, Aug 22 2020 4:32 am EDT What if I LOVE making a huge mess of my toilet?

The card backs are uniform on every card, but they have an orientation. So, in a sense, you could trick the deck by rotating all (and only) the Aces, for example. As long as nobody rotates half the deck with a shuffle, they would effectively be marked. This is the same way you could mark other decks that have a front up side on the back (logo, casino name, etc). Fri, Aug 14 2015 10:29 am EDT ?  ""]",2

The compartments can be adapted to the driver's objects and needs (or the people in the back seat). Moreover, Izzy is water and dirt resistant and is designed to store all items safely, even during the most various driving maneuvers. Finally, izzy is also a stylish bag that can be taken along at any time. Thu, Oct 1 2020 7:33 am EDT How does izzy differ from a bag for photographers that already exists? Izzy is designed especially for cars. For example, izzy has an integrated seatbelt to buckle up your items even when the bag is open, without the risk of anything falling.

We have developed izzy to make everyday driving a little safer. izzy is designed to help you sort your items better and prevent things from slipping or falling and becoming a danger.

2742,1798587426,"["" Can I pledge for more than one reward? The Kickstarter platform doesn’t allow to make more than one pledge during any specific campaign. What you can do is logon with a different user name and support us again. Additionally, all backers will receive a survey at the end of the campaign and at that time you can add additional pledges for additional awards. Wed, Mar 11 2020 5:30 pm EDT Can I upgrade my pledge? Of course! At any time you can log back onto Kickstarter and upgrade your pledge for a different award. Wed, Mar 11 2020 5:30 pm EDT I don’t have a ferromagnetic surface in my house. What are my options? Makeway works on vertical magnetic surfaces (fridge, cars, metallic front door, magnetic white board or any other ferromagnetic surface).  Additionally, you can go to a hardware store and buy a piece of a thin metal sheet that you can screw to a wall in your house and create your own Makeway space. Wed, Mar 11 2020 5:33 pm EDT Will it work with magnetic / metallic painted wall? Unfortunately, in our testing, magnetic paint has not shown to be strong enough to hold the tracks. Sorry about that. Wed, Mar 11 2020 5:47 pm EDT Will Makeway be EU shipping friendly? Update: No, unfortunately we are not offering EU friendly shipping right now. Sorry about that. Wed, Apr 15 2020 4:52 pm EDT What materials are the Makeway pieces made of? All the parts are made of high quality injected ABS plastic. The marbles are standard glass marbles. (Don’t worry, we've dropped many glass marbles from really high distances. They don’t break). Thu, Mar 12 2020 6:34 am EDT Why aren't you offering stretch goals? We thought about it but we worked really hard, for several years, to bring Makeway to life and we did everything we can to offer as many parts as possible, each part going through a long stage of R&D with hundreds of prototypes along the way, finally reaching a product we are confident we can deliver on. Offering stretch goals would, in our view, take the focus off the product and result in compromise of the quality of the product which is definitely something we want to avoid. Wed, Mar 11 2020 6:21 pm EDT Would it be possible to buy different tricks solely? Yes. All backers will receive a survey at the end of the campaign and at that time you can add additional pledges, extension kits and other features. Wed, Mar 11 2020 5:40 pm EDT What are the measurements of the different pieces? Wed, Mar 11 2020 6:11 pm EDT What age range would you say this product is for? From 6 years old and up. Wed, Mar 11 2020 6:11 pm EDT How and when do I choose between Gold / Silver color edition? After you back our campaign all backers will get a survey upon the completion of the campaign, that's when you can tell us which edition you prefer. Wed, Mar 11 2020 6:11 pm EDT Can I use metal marbles instead of glass marbles? Sure. We prefer glass marbles so that there is no magnetic interference while the marble is rolling, but in certain stages of our R&D we used metal marbles and though they acted slightly differently than expected, they are very cool to use!

From here, you’ll be able to adjust your pledge amount or choose a new reward tier you\'d like to pledge for and your pledge amount will update automatically. Here is a video for reference: https://youtu.be/Ak8SWlMeIoo *How should I calculate the pledge amount correctly?* The pledge amount should include both the product price and shipping cost. Product price of each version of K8 can be found at the rewards section. The shipping cost should be times to the amount of keyboards you have backed. For example, price of 2 x keyboard is $120, shipping cost is $20, here is the math if you need 3 x keyboards: ($60 x 3) + ($10 x 3) = $210, and PM us what you want, otherwise, we don’t know this.

But pls note that the Optical switch on K6 and K4 does not compatible with the K8 Optical switch keyboard Tue, Jun 2 2020 10:37 am EDT Shipping schedule We expect to start shipping in July (finish shipping in August) according to the product model as our supplier produces every batch of the keyboard according to the product model. For orders without any address problem, we will place orders to our shipping company by bulk with a certain method, like product model, country, order number, etc. Frankly, it will be hard to place orders by bulk only according to the order number, as it will be very slow in the process. In terms of the same product model, I won’t say backer #6000 will receive the keyboard earlier than #10 for example. However, backer #100 and #1000 won’t have a big difference in terms of shipping schedule. The time of delivery from Hong Kong to your address depends on local delivery and customs clearance, which we cannot fully control. Tue, Jun 2 2020 10:38 am EDT VAT or import tax included? Due to the customs policy of different countries, we CANNOT guarantee if there is a tax for you. Our product price does not include VAT or import tax of your country.

Tue, Jun 2 2020 12:24 pm EDT Declare value As the current selling price on Kickstarter is a discounted price, we can declare it according to the EX factory price + shipping which will be around $40. But of course, there are lots of extra costs other than Ex-factory price + shipping costs, such as ads and an administration fee of Kickstarter and credit card company, hope you can understand. Tue, Jun 2 2020 12:24 pm EDT Can you declare the parcel as a gift? No, we are sorry that the courier service does not accept this kind of declaration. Tue, Jun 2 2020 12:24 pm EDT Do I need a palm rest for the K8? The K8 has 2 adjustable angled rubber feet, and the K8 will be more ergonomic to type on even without a palm rest. We’ll sell the palm rest (Walnut Wood) add-on after the campaign finished, you can buy it at your discretion. Please make sure you buy with exactly the same email as Kickstarter, so that we could ship it together with the keyboard. Otherwise, we can’t ship it. Tue, Jun 2 2020 12:24 pm EDT Why don’t you put Windows and Mac legends in the same keycap? There was a negative response when we tried that the previous campaign, that’s why we stick with the current design. Some of the users may never use another system, so it is not necessary to print them in the same keycaps. And we also offer extra Mac and Windows keycaps, you can simply swap them based on your needs. Tue, Jun 2 2020 12:24 pm EDT How does the keyboard, switch manage spills, waterproof, splashproof? Optical switch has a better splashproof capability comparatively, but the charging port is NOT splashproof which is same as other type c charging devices. Tue, Jun 2 2020 12:24 pm EDT What’s the sound like for Optical Red, Blue, Brown? The sound of optical switch is pretty much similar to Gateron mechanical switch, you can check this video for the switch sound comparison: https://youtu.be/piOYCaaSM7o Tue, Jun 2 2020 12:24 pm EDT What is the differences between Optical switch and Gateron mechanical switch？ 2. As the Optical switch is not using physical attachment for key strike, it is twice the durability than competing switches for up to 100 million keystrokes. Tue, Jun 2 2020 12:24 pm EDT Will you have other color option for Optical switch? Green or White etc. The Keychron Optical switch version is compatible with a selection of Optical switches. We are planning to increase its compatibility by releasing 3 more variants later this year. Tue, Jun 2 2020 12:24 pm EDT Will you have other keycaps? Like the PBT or double shot keycap It won\'t be available when we start shipping the K8 in July. We’ll announce the schedule once we’re ready. Tue, Jun 2 2020 12:24 pm EDT Will you offer Yellow switch? We don’t have plans to offer the yellow switch for the launch mostly because we already have 27 SKUs for the K8. Adding more switches means more SKUs, it will add more trouble for the manufacture and shipping. BTW, you can buy the hot-swappable version K8 and swap it with yellow switch yourself. Tue, Jun 2 2020 12:24 pm EDT Can I buy the hot-swappable switch, PCB or frame case separately? No, we don’t have a plan to sell these components separately. It’s because we already have 27 SKUs for the K8. Adding more switches means more SKUs, it will add more trouble for the manufacture and shipping. Tue, Jun 2 2020 12:24 pm EDT Can I choose two or more Gateron switch options in the hot-swappable keyboard? No, as it’ll mess up the production, pick and pack easily, while you can easily buy another switch on the market. Tue, Jun 2 2020 12:24 pm EDT K8 code name Tue, Jun 2 2020 12:24 pm EDT What switch stabilizer do you use? Plate mounted stabilizer, you can only swap out unless you open the keyboard.

2841,253481557,"[' Does the Green Box Garden include the dirt? Yes! Except it\'s not plain old dirt. It\'s Miracle Grow premium potting mix. The potting mix is already in the container, as it comes fully assembled. All you need to do is remove the protective top and the stickers that cover the vent holes. And viola! Your container is ready for seeds or transplants. No need to drive to the hardware store or garden center to buy dirt. The potting mix is actually the key to getting the water to move up from the reservoir to the plant\'s roots. The potting mix in the Green Box Garden acts like a wick (or a straw) for the water, as it is lighter and more absorbent than dirt. It also promotes more vigorous root growth. Normal garden soil used in a container would basically turn to concrete. And in a self-watering container, regular dirt would not transport the water upwards to the roots. Wed, May 6 2020 11:35 pm EDT How big is the reservoir? The reservoir at the bottom of the container holds 32 fluid ounces. That is about half of a 2 liter bottle. The size of the reservoir was carefully chosen, in order to balance the water-to-potting mix ratio. If the water reservoir is too big compared to the size of the container, there\'s not enough potting mix to provide adequate room for the plant\'s roots to grow. And the container would be too heavy to move; it would no longer be portable. On the other hand, if the water reservoir is too small in comparison to the container, it would need to be filled far more often. The Green Box Garden has a potting mix-to-water ratio of 6 to 1. Meaning there is 6 times the volume of potting mix compared to the amount of water held in reserve. This is the ideal ratio for providing balance and promoting healthy plant growth. Wed, May 6 2020 11:43 pm EDT How often will I need to water the plant? Never! OK, that\'s sort of a misleading answer. With the Green Box Garden you fill the reservoir, and the plant waters itself by drawing water up through the potting mix via the natural capillary action of the potting mix. Disclaimer: When starting plants from SEEDS, you will need to moisten the soil near the top, in order to promote seed germination. But once the plant is established, its roots will draw water up from the reservoir, and you won\'t need to water from the top anymore. Thu, May 7 2020 12:19 am EDT OK, then...How often will I need to fill the water reservoir? That depends on many things. The size of the plant. The type of plant. The temperature and amount of sun the plant is exposed to. In general, the water reservoir of the Green Box Garden only needs to be refilled every 5 to 14 days. In some test cases, quick-growing plants such as radishes were grown from seed to harvest needing only ONE refill of the water reservoir. In another test, a green bean plant (bush variety) was able to go 3 weeks between refills before the leaves started showing signs of stress. However, these were extreme tests conducted during the research phase of the Green Box Garden, and are not necessarily typical. Water-loving plants such as tomatoes and cucumbers usually need a refill every 7 days. Plants such as roses that thrive in slightly drier soil every 15 to 20 days. Obviously if the plant is exposed to the hot, dry days of summer, you may need to refill the reservoir more often. Thu, May 7 2020 12:20 am EDT How is the Green Box Garden better than regular plant containers? Let us count the ways! 1) The Green Box Garden is fully assembled and ready to grow...right out of the box. No other plant container is like that. Visit your local hardware store or garden supply center and you will find hundreds of plant containers of various shapes, sizes, and materials. Do they have premium potting mix included? Do they have a built-in handle for portability? Are they made of FDA approved food-grade material (which is a must for growing edible plants)? Are they sturdy enough to be used over and over for years to come? Are they self-watering? 2) The Green Box Garden uses less water, and requires less frequent watering. By eliminating water loss due to evaporation and seeping into the ground, the Green Box Garden uses up to 75% less water. All the water you put into the reservoir ends up being used by the plant! A flower or vegetable that is planted in a regular old planting pot from the hardware store will need to be watered every day...sometimes multiple times per day if it\'s located in a hot, dry location such as a deck or patio! That\'s because most of the water drains out the bottom or evaporates from the top. In contrast, the Green Box Garden water reservoir holds several day\'s worth of water (in many cases, over a week\'s worth of water). 3) Portability. The Green Box Garden has a sturdy metal handle. And for plants that have grown too tall to use the metal handle, the Green Box Garden can be moved and carried via the handle lip around the top of the container. You may need to move your plants to give them better sunlight. Or protect them from inclement weather. Or to clean your deck. Or perhaps you have a plant that can be outside in the summer, and inside the house in the fall and winter. The Green Box Garden allows you to move your plants wherever you want them to be, quickly and easily! 4) Less problems with insects, weeds, mold, mildew, and fungus. Traditional plant containers that are watered from the TOP attract all of these nasty problems. That\'s because with a regular plant container, you are constantly adding water to the top layer of soil. This becomes a breeding ground for weeds, mildew, and insects. With the Green Box Garden, the top layer of potting mix stays much drier, because the plant is watered from BELOW. This difference vastly reduces problems with insects and harmful organisms, and promotes much healthier plant growth. Thu, May 7 2020 12:33 am EDT Couldn\'t I just make my own? The container looks pretty simple. One of the taglines we use for the Green Box Garden is ""Simple Idea - BIG Results."" So yes, it is a simple idea. The parts & pieces, and how they all fit together is not complicated. But up until now, no one else had put it all together in a complete package. Which is why the Green Box Garden design was given a United States patent, and then introduced via Kickstarter. The sticky note is also a very simple idea...a little piece of paper with some glue on the back. But the way it was put together and used was revolutionary, and changed the way people wrote notes! There are many YouTube videos that show people different ways to assemble your own raised garden bed, irrigation system, and even various types of self-watering containers. If you are looking for a fun project to work on, we encourage you to try some of them. But most will be expensive and time-consuming, both to build and to maintain. And the results will probably be less than what you hope for. I know, because I have tried many of them myself. Which is why I created the Green Box Garden. If you are looking for a new type of self-watering container that is 100% ready to grow, and can go from box to garden in minutes, then the Green Box Garden might be what you are looking for.

2846,1460859360,"[' Why the wide range of pricing in the mascara world? Mascara (and cosmetics in general) are marketed and categorized into various segments:  MASS - which are lower-end and priced products available at grocery or drug stores.  PRESTIGE - which are higher-end and priced products available in department stores and boutique shops (such as Ulta, Sephora).  LUXURY - which are the ultra, designer-esq products found in higher-end department stores (such as SAKS, Bergdorf, etc.)  Lash Duet is a PRESTIGE caliber product with an exclamation point, as it doubles the expense of production because of its 2 brushes, 2 wands, expanded chamber, double ""goop"", etc.  Even with all of this extra - we are determined to make Lash Duet affordable within the Prestige category. Tue, Nov 5 2019 8:15 am EST Someone asked what makes LASH DUET different from Sephora\'s 2-brush applicator. Thanks for asking!  Lash Duet is different because it uses reverse-tweezer technology as opposed to Sephora\'s regular tweezer motion.  This means that the resting position of the brushes is CLOSED - not open like a regular tweezer.  That gives you a much more controlled, ergonomic, intuitive interaction with the applicator because you don\'t have to try and hold the wand/brushes together while you\'re applying mascara.  BIG DIFFERENCE!  Also, Lash Duet has dual ""wipers"" so that both brushes get ""squeegeed"" off as they exit the container.  This is also very important to the application process because mascara goop doesn\'t build up on the inner brushes.  The reverse tweezer motion and dual wipers are both patented by Lash Duet. Wed, Nov 6 2019 2:12 pm EST Someone asked if Lash Duet is just an applicator, or will it come as a complete mascara product. Thanks for asking this because it\'s important to know.  YES - Lash Duet is a complete mascara product with the applicator and ""goop"", just like other mascara you would purchase.  Lash Duet Mascara is disposable, like other mascaras.  I will say, however, that in our product testing, the ""goop"" lasts longer than regular 1-brush mascara product, as it typically only takes 1 ""dip"" into the goop per application.

Above all, both of the cable supports two-way magnetic connection. 1/ Simplelink supports USB-C standard while Simplelink+ supports both USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 standard. 2/ Simplelink supports: 10Gbps data transfer/4K HDMI out/60W Charging in performance, while Simplelink+ gets: 40Gbps data transfer/5K or Dual 4K HDMI out/100W Charging. 3/ Simplelink connects via HDMI and USB-C port, whilt Simplelink+ connects via USB-C port. 4/ Simplelink is available in 0.8m/1.5m cable length, while Simplelink+ gets 2/3m. 5/ Simplelink has 20-pin magnetic tips while Simplelink+ is 24-pin. Mon, May 4 2020 10:08 pm EDT Why Simplelink does not get long cable(2/3m) option? The original Simplelink requires much more effort to test the long cable option. For a long time we did try to get to 2m, but the results showed that it just couldn't get to the speed and stability that we required in the first place. We don't sell things untested or unstable. The Simplelink+ with Thunderbolt 3 standard got everything tested with all boxes ticked, while getting ideal thermal/speed stats, that's why we gets it available until now. Mon, May 4 2020 10:08 pm EDT Do I need Simplelink+? If you mostly use the cable for your mobile devices and smaller ultrabooks, or want to stream the HDMI to one monitor, then the Simplelink is more than enough to suit your needs. If you connect your cable between bigger-sized(15''+) ultrabooks and Ultra HD monitor/dual monitors, they usually requires bigger power consumption and higher performance threshold, then we recommend you the Simplelink+. If you need long cable like 2 or 3 meters, the Simplelink+ is also the one that we can offer now. It can endure longer distance data and power transferring.

In addition to Heilala’s very own sustainably grown vanilla, BIOBLUME by Heilala also includes botanical oils including Rosehip, Jojoba, Marula, Safflower, Kakadu Plum, Avocado, Sytenol, Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate, L22, and Oleosoft-4. Mon, Nov 16 2020 3:42 pm EST What skin types is BIOBLUME by Heilala for? All skin types! Even oily skin, do not be afraid of using oils. It sounds counterintuitive but the right facial oil will help stabilise and regulate your skin’s sebum production to make your skin less oily overall. The Jojoba oil in our blend is an incredibly lightweight and breathable oil that breaks down and dissolves sebum. Mon, Nov 16 2020 4:36 pm EST I have sensitive skin, can I use BIOBLUME by Heilala? While our formulation is 100% clean and naturally derived, as well as dermatologically tested, we do recommend if you have sensitive skin or allergies that you do a patch test first.  If your skin is not responding well to our product, please discontinue use. Mon, Nov 16 2020 4:36 pm EST Can I use other products on top of BIOBLUME by Heilala facial oil? The general rule with skincare products is to layer from the thinnest to the thickest product, therefore we would recommend applying our facial oil after cleansing or before other, thicker products however the nourishing ingredients mean you don’t need to use any other product on top of the oil.  For added hydration through the day we recommend adding two drops into your daily moisturiser. Mon, Nov 16 2020 9:37 pm EST Can I wear makeup over BIOBLUME by Heilala? Yes, we recommend applying BIOBLUME and letting your skin absorb the oil for 3 – 5 minutes before applying makeup. Mon, Nov 16 2020 4:36 pm EST Is BIOBLUME by Heilala vegan? BIOBLUME is vegan and also free from; fillers, artificial colours, synthetic preservatives, gluten, artificial fragrances, alcohol, phthalate, silicones, mineral oils, genetically modified or irradiated ingredients Mon, Nov 16 2020 3:42 pm EST ?

Tue, Mar 10 2020 9:08 am EDT How do you plan to ship from Germany to Israel when it\'s under Coronairus quarantine for who knows how long? The Hebrew versions of my comics are already with קבוצת יצירת קומיקס, the comic collective who distributes Foggy Comics in Israel. As a matter a fact, they have already started to market Sonica #2 starting from 10/3/20. If you read Hebrew, live in Israel and willing to back me, the best reward for you is the ""Israeli Special"" - you get all 5 of my comics (Sherman\'s Pit 1-3, Sonica 1-2) for about a 100 Shekels. You could even pick up your rewards there at קבוצת יצירת קומיקס table at the next convention, instead of waiting for the shipping. (We\'re talking about Israeli Post, so you know what I mean). Sat, Mar 14 2020 11:03 am EDT You mentioned you have Hebrew and English versions. If you market comics in Deutschland, why isn\'t it in Deutsch? When I launched Foggy Comics in Germany in 2018, I had a budget only for one offset edition of each of my comics and I wanted to market Sonica and Sherman\'s Pit at conventions all over continental Europe. The budget issue is still an issue, which is part of why you\'re looking at this Kickstarter. If we can make it to 2000€ Stretch Goal, I can send Sonica #1-#2 for translation (weil meine Deutsch ist schlecht) and print a double issue, all in Deutsch, which would be added to rewards. Tue, Mar 10 2020 9:43 am EDT Forget Sonica! What\'s up with Sherman\'s Pit, when is the next issue coming up? Now that production has wrapped up on Sonica #2, I\'ve already started writing the script for Sherman\'s Pit #4. The plan is to release all four issues in a single volume, so far in English and Hebrew. I\'ve put it into my 3000€ Stretch Goal. Frankly, I think Sherman deserves his own Kickstarter, but if we make it to 3000€ it would buy me enough time to rush it. After all, #2 and #3 are already complete, just not translated to English and without any printing budget at the moment. Rest assured, we\'re definitely going back to The Pit.

2877,29175201,"["" Won't kids just 'game it' (cheat) to gain more rewards? One of the features of the game is the parent/child interaction. When a child completes an activity, a message is sent to their parent for approval. The parent has the opportunity to approve activities as well as send messages of encouragement (or to call them out on them 'cheating' the system). In our user testing sessions, the messaging was such a big hit that we prioritized adding in a closed-loop messaging component that would allow for parent set up and monitored messaging between siblings and friends. Sat, May 25 2019 10:17 pm EDT Isn't using an App counter-intuitive to getting kids off of devices? Yes. Absolutely. But, kids are already on devices and meeting them where they love to be and play is sometimes the first step to get into their world. We know that technology is here to stay so our intention is to help them develop good habits and allow them to transition between the virtual and real world. By encouraging them to explore some good 'old school' play, kids can discover some of the simpler ways to entertain themselves that give them choices outside of their devices. Sat, May 25 2019 10:16 pm EDT How can we help get KIDICTED™ launched? Thank you so much for supporting our campaign. The more awareness we can build around KIDICTED™, the more successful this campaign and our launch will be. Please share this campaign by using the social buttons on the main page, follow us on Instagram or Facebook @iamKIDICTED, sign up on our website www.iamKIDICTED.com or tweet about us! Sat, May 25 2019 10:16 pm EDT Will KIDICTED™ have ads? NO! As a parent, apps that have ads are both annoying and a bit scary. We don't like them, our kids don't like them and we won't have them in our app. On the flip side, KIDICTED™ will need to be a pay per download app, that will help fund the development to date and fund future development. Parents will have the ability to purchase add-on activity pack to extent their kids play or to celebrate a special theme. These purchases will be offered through direct marketing or by exploring new content in the app. There is a possibility that we may use alerts to notify parents that new content is available but we will always strive to make the experience as unobtrusive as possible. Our goal is to have the app 100% kid friendly and we are following COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) guidelines as well as Canadian Media guidelines. Once we launch, we look to apply for certification as well, Sat, May 25 2019 10:16 pm EDT Can I gift my copy of KIDICTED? Yes! If you don't have kids yourself or yours are all grown and you want to support us building a #techbalancedlife, you can definitely have your copy shared with someone who would love to play. (We will confirm recipients once our campaign closes in a survey.) In fact, we just opened up a new reward which will allow you to pledge a donation for the Gift of KIDICTED for life and receive a personalized digital greeting from our partners at UnWrapIt.

2901,242452545,"[' DIFFERENT HAND SIZES ?? For kids\' size GripBeats® is adjustable enough to fit hands of width size as small as 6cm / 2.3"" and with the same device, a hand as large as width 11cm / 4.3"". This measurement is the width of the hand. The single strap and slidable loop mechanism allows GripBeats® to be adjusted to practically any sized hand and still allows full access to all the sensors. The length of the wrist strap section (where it connects at the wrist like a watch) is 26cm / 10""). If these dimensions aren\'t on your range, please contact us and we should be able to make a slight adjustment. These are the latest measurements. :) Thu, Nov 21 2019 8:04 pm EST USING TWO GRIPBEATS® AT ONCE ?? When using GripBeats®as a duo, both are still independent GripBeats® devices. That being said, by having two devices, one in each hand, the user has access to the exclusive new and creative gestures such as synchronized hand movements and touch for e.g. claps, clicks, rotating in symmetry (or the reverse of!). Of course, by having two devices there\'s inevitably the ability to play two different instruments at once. We made a video about this under the headline, \'Using Two GripBeats® Simultaneously\', under \'GRIPBEATS® Tutorials\' on the Kickstarter Page. Fri, Nov 15 2019 2:45 pm EST HOW DOES GRIPBEATS® CONNECT TO AND MAKE SOUND ?? GripBeats®connects directly to your Android and Apple smart devices (phones and tablets) as well as your desktop computer via BLE MIDI, that\'s MIDI using Bluetooth. The sounds you create come from these connected devices. Fri, Nov 15 2019 2:52 pm EST CAN I USE GRIPBEATS® WITH HEADPHONES / EARPHONES ?? Yes! Now because GripBeats® connects to the software or app on your phone/device/computer, the sounds that are made come out of this connected device, therefore you can use your audio jack port or Bluetooth connectivity (again!) as you would normally for your ear or headphones. Fri, Nov 15 2019 2:52 pm EST WHAT COLORS WILL GRIPBEATS® COME IN? GripBeats® will come in four different colors now that we\'ve just hit our $40K stretch goal! The first will be BLACK while the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th colors will be decided in a backers\' survey post-launch. Sun, Nov 17 2019 12:51 am EST CAN I PLAY AND EDIT MY MUSIC LIVE ?? By using the GripBeats®App sequencer, you can record, loop, save, and overwrite all of the above during both live and rested sessions. A live looping session would be you recording multiple instrument tracks over a repeating number of beats, say four beats to a bar. Another live (general) session allows you to record your music without the loop over however many beats and as long as you want! A rested session means that after you\'ve recorded your music you can go back to it using the navigation controls and make changes to its various sound settings and effects both using GripBeats® and the controls in the GripBeats® themselves. Fri, Nov 15 2019 3:04 pm EST HOW IS GRIPBEATS® A FASHION ACCESSORY ?? Perhaps it\'s not a Rolex or Fitbit but GripBeats®definitely offers its very own resting wearable mode as a standalone bracelet. In Wrist Mode, GripBeats® can either be a complete parallel wrap-around (like wrapping a very long bracelet directly around itself 2-3 times) OR it can be spiraled around the forearm, whichever suits you! Fri, Nov 15 2019 3:31 pm EST CAN I USE GRIPBEATS® AS A MIDI CONTROLLER? Yes! Right now GripBeats® outputs MIDI via Bluetooth which means it can be connected to 100s of apps or DAWs which receive a MIDI input e.g. Ableton or Garageband. Better still, MIDI signals can be mapped to various dials and controls within said application. Take Ableton for example, we\'ve been able to use GripBeats®\' rotation to change the rotation dials and also send stop, play, record commands straight from the GripBeats®device. The GripBeats®App also allows you to change the configuration of your GripBeats® device so that you might want to adjust the sensitivity of different movements or that of the touch sensors. You can assign your own gestures from the list of those provided or user-define your very own (stretch goal $80K). Fri, Nov 15 2019 11:22 pm EST WORLDWIDE FREE SHIPPING AND PREPAID CUSTOMS TAX ?? We will ensure that every GripBeats®order is DDP - Delivery Duty Paid. This means that VAT and customs clearance will be covered on our side. Fri, Nov 15 2019 11:45 pm EST WILL THE GRIPBEATS® APP ENABLE GRIPBEATS®\' FULL POTENTIAL OVER CONTROLS FOR MAKING MUSIC THROUGH MOVEMENT AND TOUCH OR DO I NEED TO CONNECT TO A DAW INSTEAD ?? We built GripBeats® in parallel with the GripBeats® App which means that every feature which we\'ve described is at its best when connected to the GripBeats® App. The GripBeats® App has been made for Apple iOS and is halfway completed for Android already. Other than the GripBeats®App, you might find other apps that can receive a MIDI input, in which case, you can pre-program (within the GripBeats® App) your GripBeats®\'MIDI and gesture outputs to then experiment with on said third-party app. One example might be wanting to trigger one of the instrument sounds of this third-party app by using a squeeze gesture positioned at a 45-degree angle out in front of you which you just preconfigured within the GripBeats® App. Sat, Nov 16 2019 12:55 am EST HOW USER FRIENDLY IS THE GRIPBEATS® APP ?? The user interface for choosing your preconfigurations of motion, touch and MIDI outputs has been made to be visually interactive and accessible from the get-go, regardless what prior knowledge in music theory or engineering you might have. In other words, as a GripBeats®owner, you\'re already defined a musician and all that\'s expected of you is that you now decide on how to use your motion and touch controls to make music! Sat, Nov 16 2019 1:14 am EST I HAVE NO BACKGROUND IN MUSIC BUT THIS LOOKS AMAZING. WILL I UNDERSTAND IT? GripBeats® uses your motion and touch to make music. So in terms of control, you already have a full understanding of how you can control your music through movement, gripping, clicking, tapping and so on. The actual musical sounds, effects and techniques you produce will be accessible from either the \'learning mode\' (a feature of the GripBeats® University in-app platform) or \'free mode\'. The understanding of rhythm, melodies, chords, dynamics, articulation, and other controls will be taught in \'learning mode\' at your own speed. Free Mode allows to put your skills to the test without the tutorials. Sat, Nov 16 2019 1:14 am EST CAN I DISABLE THE VIBRATION MOTOR (OR OTHER COMPONENTS) ?? Yes! We\'ve made sure that users have full access over the sensitivity of their GripBeats®hardware components, whether it\'s the vibration motor, LEDs, pressure or the motion sensors. Turn them off. Turn them up. Add thresholds. Or have them at max. It\'s all up to you. Sat, Nov 16 2019 2:06 pm EST IM PHYSICALLY IMPAIRED CAUSING DIFFICULTY IN MOVING, CAN I STILL USE GRIPBEATS® ?? Something which has raised our attention is the number of people asking if they can use GripBeats® even if they have limited movements in certain joints, arms or fingers and in most cases, it\'s very possible. Imagine looking at an analog clock and you see the marks for seconds around the edges. If you were to point directly at the center of that clock with your thumb pointing up. By then rotating your hand 2 seconds either clockwise or anticlockwise, you would demonstrate movement of about 12 degrees. This range of 10-12 degrees of movement is what we consider the minimum and most comfortable range for most people for being able to control GripBeats®\'sounds and effects. That said, if your hand is steady enough, this range can be reduced even further. In summary, by comparing your physical range of movement to the seconds of an analog clock, you are to calculate how many degrees of potential commands you have control over. Note that some people have an uncontrollable tremor or other subtle involuntary movements. If this is the case, it\'s very easy to expand the range so that perhaps instead of just using 10-12 degrees of movement for each command, you expand the range to as much as 90 degrees. By doing so, you could potentially have up to four individual controls (if you are one of those people who can rotate their hand 360 degrees!). An interactive tutorial will be designed especially to help GripBeats®users understand how to define their own range of movement in the GripBeats® App. Sun, Nov 17 2019 3:00 am EST THE GRIPBEATS® APP IS FREE !! The GripBeats® App is FREE! You get all the sounds and effects plus controls over gestures and all the added features for sharing, recording, post-producing, etc. included! Mon, Nov 18 2019 12:08 am EST WHAT IS THE TRANSMISSION SPEED LIKE ?? The current bluetooth transmission rate of GripBeats®(in total) is 17ms which is practically unnoticeable and fast enough to emulate any musical instrument (33ms is a guideline for noticing transmission delay so we\'re way ahead of that). We will also have the option to plug in your GripBeats®via USB to use as a wired MIDI controller. Thu, Nov 21 2019 1:24 am EST ?  ']",16

2910,314941316,"["" How do I buy more add-on items like more filters and hard case? See this step-by-step guide for desktop/laptop (not mobile): https://drive.google.com/file/d/15jjCWQeqPC7R3aFPTFR5XHdpK_jpoYo4/view?usp=sharing Or just follow the steps on desktop/laptop (not mobile): Example: if your current pledge is $99 for 1 UVMask and you want 10x additional filter pads, manually add $12 to your current $99 pledge, for a total of $111. If you want 10x additional filters and 1x carrying case, the total would be $99+$12+$15= $126 (These amounts will vary depending on your original pledge and desired add-ons.) Tue, Aug 4 2020 3:05 am EDT UV light can be harmful. How can we be sure that the product is safe to use? UVMask is tested by SGS to be completely safe according to UL1598 CRD (dated 2020-6-29), Additional Requirements For Germicidal Equipment; and IEC 62471, Photobiological Safety of Lamps and Lamp Systems (1st edition, dated 2006-07). UVMask has a fully light-sealed design with multiple fail-safe measures so UV light will never leak out from the inner component of sterile-vortex. You can find the official SGS UV safety report certificate here proving UVMask is free of any UV/Bluelight related risk or hazard: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m1muW3ZgI-muWvv7u7q_ArGXD3rBzXhS/view?usp=sharing Mon, Aug 10 2020 6:00 am EDT Would the UV-C LEDs in UVMask generate ozone? Although some types of UV light are capable of generating ozone (O3), a gas that naturally exists in the upper atmosphere, which could be harmful to the respiratory system when it's at a higher concentration (the FDA requires the ozone output of indoor medical devices to be no more than 0.05 ppm), only UV wavelengths of 185 nm or shorter can be used to generate ozone. (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144860902000699) We use 265nm wavelength UV-C LEDs in the UVMask, which reliably generate a very pure and narrow range of UV-C that does not go shorter than 255nm (See our UV-C LED optical properties here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V6i9QuftIBrxrtUKTOMTdcVP3EI5nXvE/view?usp=sharing). UV-C at this narrow pure range has been empirically tested to be incapable of generating ozone. Each UVMask is factory-tested for its UV-C wavelength purity to ensure its high safety standard. Mon, Aug 10 2020 6:00 am EDT Does UVMask come in different sizes? Does it come in a child-friendly size too? You’ll be able to select the sizes in our post-campaign survey on BackerKit, together with your shipping address and add-ons! UVMask will come in 2 different sizes. We call them Type X and Type C. See Update #7 for visuals: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/umsystems/uvmask-inactivate-9999-of-all-pathogens-and-air-pollutants/posts/2912438 The core UVMask (hardshell) will still stay the same. The only size variation is the soft silicone face padding (which is also replaceable and can be purchased as an add-on). To ensure the most efficient filtration, a perfect fit, and better comfort, our R&D team used NIOSH anthropometric data in developing the most optimal silicon sizes for UVMask. In 2003, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducted a nationwide anthropometric survey of 3,997 subjects. Based on the gathered data, five sizes and shapes of heads were developed to represent the possible variations within the adult population. Type X is designed for higher nose bridges and fits large faces — Large, Long/Narrow, and Medium from NIOSH head-forms. While Type S is designed for lower bridge noses and perfectly fits smaller faces — Small and Shorter/Wide head-forms. Thanks to the silicone’s flexibility and shape, these 2 shapes will create an airtight seal, regardless of smaller variations from person to person. Please note children 6 years and older have similar face dimensions as adults with smaller faces/heads shown above. (Note: UVMask is not designed for children younger than 6. Parents may choose UVMask for younger children at their own discretion). You will be able to select the silicone padding size as well as purchasing add-on replacements during the post-campaign survey in a service called BackerKit, along with your add-ons and shipment details. Tue, Aug 4 2020 3:50 pm EDT Will the mask have a fan air system? What about moisture and heat build-up? The added noiseless convection fan forced-air system to create a positive pressure airflow that will reduce CO2 accumulation and increase oxygen level for better breathability and ventilation, as well as minimizing moisture build-up. It will not have any impact on battery life or performance. Wed, Jul 29 2020 7:46 am EDT What is the Guaranteed Delivery and 30-Day Satisfaction Guarantee? Do you offer a warranty? If for any reason, UM Systems does not ship your UVMask to you, we will fully refund your money. If you are not 100% satisfied with your purchase, you have 30 calendar days from the date of delivery to request a refund and return the mask (return shipping costs not included). We also offer a 12-month warranty. Wed, Jul 29 2020 7:46 am EDT When will my payment be processed? Kickstarter will process all card payments on August 14th once the campaign has ended successfully, so until then you will not be charged and you can upgrade your pledge level and add more items! Wed, Jul 29 2020 7:46 am EDT Can I take UVMask on an airplane and through security-check? UVMask is an electronic device with a built-in battery. Like any other electronic device, UVMask will not pass the metal detector, therefore needs to be taken off for scanning. We recommend air travelers to wear a disposal mask during security screening instead. That said, UVMask will be safe to bring on board during flight. Wed, Jul 29 2020 7:45 am EDT How will my voice sound, will I muffle? Is the mask breathable inside? Please see voice demonstration in this video: https://youtu.be/GkHLyBuCsvI UVMask’s uniquely designed internal parts with double air intakes and optimized sound engineering allow for effortless breathability and clear sound while speaking. Mon, Aug 10 2020 4:03 pm EDT What lab certifications does the UVMask have? We have the SGS Lab CE-FFP2 certification. This is according to EU standards and equivalent to the N95. We also have FDA certification for the food-grade silicone for the mask’s inner layer. See current certificates from our supply chain: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_Z1NGHIS7tb7GxfMlPJyqHTpj21shPY2?usp=sharing Please note we are still in the process of conducting further tests, such as NIOSH and EPA. We will share these as soon as we obtain them. Wed, Jul 29 2020 7:45 am EDT How long does it take to charge and how long does it last? Can I charge UVMask on the go? It takes 1.5 hours with fast charging and 2-3 hours with regular 5V charging to completely charge the mask. The full charge will last you a full-day, for 8 hours. This can be extended at any time with a power bank and the included USB-C cable. Mon, Aug 3 2020 9:33 am EDT What is the FFP2 filter used in UVMask, is it a PM2.5 filter? Our filter is not just a PM2.5 filter. PM2.5 is an understatement. UVMask’s filters are CE-FFP2 (EU standard same as N95). This is a much higher standard than PM2.5. PM2.5 filters only block 25-micron particles. FFP2 filters 0.3-micron particulates with an efficiency the same as an N95 mask. That’s an improvement of over 8,300%. See here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_Z1NGHIS7tb7GxfMlPJyqHTpj21shPY2?usp=sharing Wed, Jul 29 2020 7:45 am EDT Can the mask be used effectively when the battery is depleted? The FFP2 filter along will provide the equivalent protection of an N95 - as the name indicates, it will block very small airborne particles as small as 0.3μm like dust, pollen, droplets, tobacco, bushfire smoke, and more. Wed, Jul 29 2020 7:45 am EDT When do I change the filters? How often you change filters depends on how you use your UVMask. See the recommendations below: Wed, Jul 29 2020 7:45 am EDT When will the shipping start and do you offer worldwide and EU-friendly shipping? Shipping will start in late October 2020. We ship worldwide and we use EU-friendly shipping carriers as well. Wed, Jul 29 2020 7:45 am EDT How much will replacement filters cost and where can I buy filters after the campaign? You can get a pack of 10 for $12. This works out at $1.20 per filter. 1/ You can add more filters to your current pledge during the Kickstarter live campaign, see the instructions in the previous questions. 2/ After the Kickstarter is over, you'll be able to buy them from our Indiegogo InDemand campaign that starts Aug 15th 3/ We will also offer them in our post-campaign backer survey and later on our website: https://um.systems You’ll be able to buy a cutting stencil from us as an add-on later in the campaign, allowing you to cut out a compatible filter from any N95 or KN95 masks on the market. Wed, Jul 29 2020 7:45 am EDT What is the double breathing protection? UVMask comes with 2 layers of protection. The advanced filtration system uses CE-FFP2 air filters to purify PM 0.3 particles, including air pollution, dust, and other particles up to 100x smaller than a grain of flour! The patent-pending Sterile-Vortex technology then concentrates the UV-C light's full power on the air you breathe, adding to a higher total filtration efficiency in real-time! Wed, Jul 29 2020 7:45 am EDT What happens to the air I exhale? Exhale air will go through CE-FFP2 (N95) filter. So the air you breathe out is also filtered and purified. You can also get CE-FFP3 (N99) filters for extra protection. Mon, Aug 10 2020 8:37 pm EDT Will the mask fog up my glasses? The air intake and outtake of UVMask were carefully designed to be on the sides, allowing damp air to vent out from the sides without fogging up your glasses. The mask is also comfortable to wear with (sun)glasses, with nose support and over-head straps (or over-ear) design that leaves your ears free. Wed, Jul 29 2020 7:44 am EDT What is the Sterile-Vortex protection and how does it work? The patent-pending Sterile-Vortex technology concentrates UV-C light full power on the air you breathe with an ultra-high filtration efficiency. UV-C light is the safest UV light for humans since it has the least penetrative capabilities through human skin, making it ideal for purification. As glass components reduce UV-C light transmission, your air filter mask’s Sterile-Vortex uses the highest quality quartz optics and high precision chip manufacturing to power each UV-C LED. Wed, Jul 29 2020 7:44 am EDT What’s the technology used inside UVMask? UVMask uses two state-of-the-art Ultra-High Intensity UV-C LEDs: 265nm 25,000µW/cm² (25mW/cm²), total 50mW/cm². The sapphire optics for the LEDs ensure the highest efficiency. Regular glass blocks 100% UVC, so quartz is the best material to ensure UVC passes through the optics at the highest efficiency. Wed, Jul 29 2020 7:44 am EDT What material is the outer shell is made of? It's made out of food-grade ABS/PC material. Sun, Jul 26 2020 2:59 pm EDT Is there any patented technology? The entire UVMask is patent-pending. No mask currently produced uses UV-C light at a high enough intensity, or for a long enough period of time to effectively purify the air that is breathed. Thanks to our unique patent-pending Sterile-Vortex design, any air you breathe is purified over 10x faster than the rate at which you can breathe it! Sun, Jul 26 2020 2:59 pm EDT How safe is UVMask’s silicone for my skin? It’s FDA-certified food-grade silicone. 100% safe for your skin. Sun, Jul 26 2020 2:59 pm EDT What is the difference between UVMask and other masks on the market? UVMask is the first in the market that not only purifies and filters all the air you inhale but also the air you exhale using its patent-pending UV-C Sterile-Vortex technology and CE-FFP2 filter, it effectively filters all the air you breathe in real-time. Also, no other mask features a powerful enough (or any) UV-C light to purify the air in real-time. UVMask uses two state-of-the-art Ultra-High Intensity UV-C LEDs: 265nm 25,000µW/cm² (25mW/cm²) which filters and purifies the air you breathe in real-time. Mon, Jul 27 2020 5:08 pm EDT How should I clean the mask? Use soft fabric with a medical alcohol spray to clean the surface gently. Sun, Jul 26 2020 2:59 pm EDT Is the UVMask safe to use by adults and children? Yes, absolutely. UVMask is safe for all ages Sun, Jul 26 2020 2:59 pm EDT Does UVMask protect against air pollution, cigarette smoke, and bushfire smoke? Yes. The first layer of protection in the UVMask is a CE-FFP2 air filter that filters PM0.3, PM2.5, and PM10 particles. This includes air smog pollution, cigarette, and bushfire smoke. Mon, Jul 27 2020 5:08 pm EDT Which pledge manager will you be using after the campaign? We'll be using BackerKit to manage our post-campaign fulfillment where you'll be able to select your colors, pay for shipping, choose more add-on options, and manage your shipping address! Sun, Jul 26 2020 2:59 pm EDT How many colors are available and how do I choose one? Jet Black and Jet White. You can choose your color in the post-campaign backer survey that we’ll be sending via email after the campaign ends. Sun, Jul 26 2020 2:59 pm EDT What is the weight and is it comfortable to wear for longer periods of time? ~3 ⅞ oz. (110g). Yes, it is designed to be comfortable even over long periods of time. Sun, Jul 26 2020 2:59 pm EDT What type of charger do I need? Any standard USB charging station (charger not included with UVMask). A standard USB-A to USB-C cable is included. Sun, Jul 26 2020 2:59 pm EDT Is the included battery safe? Yes, we use 2x high-quality 3.7V / 1,800 mAh Li-Po high safety standard Li-Polymer (103450) batteries. They have been tested extensively for safety. The current Li-Polymer battery technology will never explode. Mon, Aug 3 2020 11:04 am EDT Is the battery replaceable? The battery is not replaceable, you need to charge it with the included USB-C cable. It lasts 8 hours on a single charge and you extend that by plugging it into any power bank. Mon, Aug 3 2020 9:33 am EDT Are there any battery level indicators in the UVMask? Sun, Jul 26 2020 2:59 pm EDT Are there any filter change alarms in UVMask? There is no automatic alarm. We recommend you set a reminder on your phone, depending on your typical usage pattern: Sun, Jul 26 2020 2:59 pm EDT How breathable is the mask in CFM (cubic feet per minute)? We use a 12,000 RPM fan for the forced air system, which translates to roughly about 2 CFM or 57L/minute at max output. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT Are the filters designed specifically for UVMask? Yes, they are. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT Can I wash the filter? No. We do not recommend washing the filter. Additional filters can be purchased from us at any time at a reasonably low cost. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT What happens to UV-C light if the mask is damaged? What are the fail-safe measures in UVMask? We have developed the product with your safety in mind. Hence the mask comes with two internal layers of protection. The Sterile-Vortex is 100% sealed off, followed by an inner shell ABS/PC protection layer that blocks 100% of UV-C. These two layers ensure a high level of protection in case of damage. Apart from that, the optics design of UVMask is very specific. The UV-C LEDs point sideways and have very short range focus. So in case, the mask is broken, the UV light will not be directed at the human face, and, hence, will not do any damage. In all cases, you can always refer to your User Manual where along with other helpful information you will see the advice not to turn the mask on, in case of visible damage. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT Is UVMask water-resistant? UVMask is rated IP54 water-resistant. Rain falls at a low pressure, so ratings in the IP54 to IP65 range are enough to keep the filter and interior components safe and dry. These ratings are also enough to stop airborne particulates from damaging the filter and components inside the enclosure. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT How long can I continuously wear the mask? he FFP2 filter will provide the equivalent protection of an N95 - as the name indicates, it will block 95% of airborne particles as small as 0.3μm like dust, droplets, smoke, pollen. Mon, Aug 3 2020 9:33 am EDT How do you change the filters? Open the front shell (it's attached by magnets, so it’s very easy to open). Gently remove the orange frame of the filter, slide out the older filter, and slide in the new filter. Put the orange frame back in place. Close the front shell. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT What’s inside the box of a single UVMask? Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT Will UVMask offer a warranty on Kickstarter perks? Yes! UVMask comes with a 1-year limited warranty. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT Can I use more than 1 filter in a mask? Technically yes, but we do not see any benefit of doing so. UVMask already provides sufficient protection against all pollutants and allergens with a single filter. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT What is the safe upper limit of volumetric flow that UVMask can purify in real-time? 6-10 liters per second (normal human breath is about 0.5 liters per breath) Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT Will it be comfortable to wear the mask during a run? Yes. You can wear the straps both around your ears or behind your neck (recommended for active sports). You can run comfortably with UVMask correctly worn. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT Is UVMask suitable for people with asthma? People with asthma or other related breathing difficulties may require CPAP machines to assist breathing. Please note that UVMask is not an FDA approved CPAP device, therefore we do not recommend patients who require CPAP to use UVMask. That said, if a user does not normally require CPAP machine to assist breathing, UVMask can be used for enhanced breathing filtration and it does come with forced air positive pressure system that helps improve breathability. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT Is it for only personal use or can it be used by several people? Personal use is strongly recommended. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT How long do the UV-C bulbs last and will there be any replacements available? We use two state-of-the-art UV-C LEDs (Made in Japan) in every UVMask which have a minimum lifetime of 10,000 hours. So they will probably last longer than the mask itself, therefore never needing a replacement. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT Can UVMask be worn while charging? Absolutely yes. You can wear it while charging with a power bank for extended hours. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT In case the straps break or become loose, will it be available to buy more, from where, and for how much? Yes, we will offer replacement straps as add-ons and you can purchase after the campaign ends from our website at a low cost. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT Can I add one more masks to my existing pledge? Yes, just add a fixed $89 to your existing pledge for each additional mask. An additional shipping charge of $10 will be added to the post-campaign survey. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT Are the filters treated with any solutions or chemicals? No, we don't treat the filters with any chemicals. These are non VOC filters, 100% safe for breathing. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT How long can the filters be stored? Each filter has a five-year shelf life. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT What are the fail-safe measures in the UVMask? Both batteries and UV-C LCDs are doubled-up for fail-safe backup, on top of the extended power. So if one fails, the other one will still work. We designed our circuit board and MCU power management logic that way to be smart enough to continue operation. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT What are the fail-safe measures so that your UV-C to never hit skin and eyes directly? UV light is a form of light, so it only travels in straight lines. And UV-C light is easily blocked. Standard window glass, according to the International Ultraviolet Association, will block 100% of the UV-C light. (See: https://hps.org/publicinformation/ate/q12082.html) While air flows freely through a spiral-shaped channel, UV-C gets 100% trapped and blocked, only confined in the vortex itself. It is this patent-pending design that allowed us to put high-intensity UV-C light safely in a durable ABS/PC walled vortex shape and protected by a further layer of the inner wall in the mask. Furthermore, both UV-C LEDs in the vortex are also positioned sideways, making the projection angle parallel to the human face as an extra layer of fail-safe measure. So to summarize, UV-C is completely 100% sealed within the vortex chamber and will never leak out and have any skin or eye contact, making it safe and robust. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT Does the mask make a noise and how loud is it? UVMask is designed to operate with quietness in mind. All components we use are tested for noise reduction. Sun, Aug 9 2020 4:31 am EDT What if I have a beard / facial hair? It all depends on the style of facial hair. We recommend following CDC 'Facial Hairstyles and Filtering Facepiece' guidelines, which can be found here: https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/images/infographics/FacialHairWmaskLG.jpg Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT What is the recommended operating temperature and storage temperature? The operation temp is -22°F (-30°C) to 140°F ( 60°C). Storage temperature -20 °F (-5 °C) to +86 °F (+30 °C). Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT Is UVMask regulated by the FDA? UVMask is initially marketed to the general public for non-medical, non-source control purposes, such as personal face-covering/protection for the general public, use in construction, and other industrial applications. Face masks marketed to the general public for general non-medical purposes, such as use in construction and other industrial applications, are not medical devices. These types of face masks that are not intended for medical or surgical use and without medical or surgical types of claims are not regulated by the FDA as medical devices. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT Is UVMask metal detector safe? You will need to take the mask down and pack it for scanning when going through a metal detector. So you'd ideally need a regular surgical mask in the pocket in a situation like a security check. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT How do you solve the problem of coughing and sneezing? With the upcoming addition of the forced air system, coughing and sneezing won’t cause an issue in droplets going inside the vortex. Mon, Aug 3 2020 3:25 am EDT Is there a version of your mask without the UV-C component? Yes, and we code name it UM95B. It will be available as an add-on post campaign.

Since it is metal and battery-free, and it shares the same front shell/strap as the core UVMask, you can purchase it for situations where battery/metal is not permitted, such as airport security check; or situations that has less-risk, so the filters alone are sufficient in protecting yourself and others, saving battery life and traveling light.

This temporary measure will be effective until further notice.” We can only guarantee that the shipping from the Netherlands won\'t be affected.

Each style will be available in a variety of colors and with a variety of strap options: - Saturn V Moon Lander will be powered by a unique Swiss-made quartz movement, the ETA G10.962 EO Chronograph with a Moon phase complication, and be cradled in a meticulously crafted 316L stainless steel, polished to a flawless luster, and offering features sure to wow the watch fanatics, freaks, and fans worldwide. - Saturn V Moon Dust will be powered by the rock-solid Swiss-made Sellita SW200-1 automatic, an option sure to appeal to traditionalists, and with case material options that include 316L stainless steel (polished or ionic plated) and bronze titanium, this model will take your breath away. Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:02 am EST What movements are in these new Saturn V watches? We’re offering two different watches in this campaign, each powered by a different Swiss-made premium movement: • Saturn V Moon Lander: The ETA G10.962 EO Chronograph Moonphase quartz Swiss movement • Saturn V Moon Dust: The Sellita SW200-1 26-jewel automatic Swiss movement Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:02 am EST Do these watches have luminescence? Will they be readable at night? Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:02 am EST Why do you keep launching your new collections on Kickstarter? We love Kickstarter for so many reasons, here are some: 1. It strengthens and builds the LIV community. Each campaign encourages our fans to get involved and communicate with us directly. Through our first four Kickstarters, we’ve developed and maintained close relationships with people all over the world, to the extent that it does feel like family at times. Many of our fans have shared their personal stories with us, as we have with them, and that\'s what makes this experience so unique and special to us. 2. It allows us to offer our watches at accessible prices. We have to produce a certain number of timepieces to fill the minimum order quantities required by our suppliers. Kickstarter allows us to pre-sell our new collections, giving us the buying power to grab competitive pricing. This lets us give our fans a significant discount in return. 3. It provides an incredible planning framework. It forces us to explain why the product needs to exist, how it\'s different from its competitors, create a timeline, and many other components that ensure that our production runs smoothly and efficiently. It also allows us to gauge the public\'s interest in a particular product, and plan for new products accordingly. 4. It\'s an updated version of an extended ""launch party.""  It\'s exhausting and filled with adrenaline, but an excellent experience. We wouldn\'t have it any other way. Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:02 am EST How does Kickstarter work? What is Kickstarter? Kickstarter recognized, like LIV, that the process of a small company getting a product funded and to market was nearly impossible. As a result, many really cool products never saw the light of day. Kickstarter saw crowdfunding as a great way to provide access to capital. Crowdfunding works like this: A company or individual puts together a detailed plan for their idea. It has a goal, a timeline, a communication plan to keep backers in the loop, and a distribution process to get the reward (the product) to the people. Think of it like investing in a startup. Kickstarter goes to great lengths to vet each campaign to weed out scams and ideas without any chance of coming to fruition. In our case, this is our fifth trip to the Kickstarter rodeo. It’s a perfect means for us to bring our latest designs to fans, watch freaks, enthusiasts, and people new to LIV. Plus, with the input we receive from our fans, we’re able to add features and enhancements. Not only do backers help get the watch to market, but they can also contribute to future offerings! Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:02 am EST What are my payment options? Are Paypal or checks an option? You can use a debit or credit card associated with Visa, Discover, JCB, MasterCard, or American Express. Kickstarter does not currently accept Maestro or Visa Electron cards. If using a pre-paid credit card, please make sure that the card has a value of at least $1 more than your pledge amount. In order for your pledge to count towards a project\'s funding goal, you must pledge through the project page using a credit card.  You cannot pay via check or cash. While Kickstarter supports most major credit cards, but they do not support payment with Paypal at this time. Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:04 am EST How Do I specify my exact watch/colorway preference? Within a few weeks after the campaign ends, you will receive an email with access to the LIV Rewards Platform where you will input your selections! Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:04 am EST When will the watches from this campaign be shipped? The watches from the campaign are estimated to  start shipping in April 2021. Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:04 am EST Where can I buy your other watches? You’ll have the option to purchase additional watches once you’ve made your pledge. Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:04 am EST How do I know you guys will deliver on what you promise? How can I trust you? This is our FIFTH Kickstarter campaign so we know what we are doing, and we have an EXCELLENT track record and history in providing an amazing quality product at an accessible price! We have thousands of fans all over the world who absolutely love our watches. Our integrity is very important to us, and our goal is to exceed our fans\' expectations, so you can be sure we will deliver on what we promise. The reviews posted about us all over the place online are proof of this. Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:06 am EST How long has your company been around for? After being in the watch industry for 22+ years, we realized that the standard business model used by the big watch companies priced most consumers out of the Swiss-made market. With this “insider” experience, we knew it didn’t have to be this way; that a new business model could make Swiss quality affordable. Enter Kickstarter. At the end of 2014, we launched LIV Watches with the GX1 on Kickstarter; getting fully funded within the first 11 hours! Just over a year later, we brought the GX1-A to life and received over $1.1 million in funding. In March 2017, we launched the Rebel, receiving more than $1.7 million dollars from over 2,900 customers, many of whom had never even heard of us. It remains the most crowdfunded Swiss watch at that time. Not resting on our laurels, we launched our most ambitious campaign to date in 2018 featuring four different new models, offering a whole new level and variety of timepieces: a Diver’s, an Alarm, a Pilot’s, and an Automatic Chronograph. Which brings us to the Saturn V launch. Our fifth launch involving a Saturn V. We see the stars (and Moon) aligning here. Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:06 am EST What is the cost of international shipping? We offer a flat rate of $15 for shipping and insurance to all global backers. Purchase more than one watch, and we provide free shipping. Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:06 am EST Can I request a specific Limited Edition number? As much as we\'d love to, unfortunately, we\'re unable to accommodate requests for specific limited edition numbers for the following reasons: 1. Because multiple people could ask for the same number, and we don\'t want to disappoint any of our fans. 2. Because fulfilling requests for Limited Edition numbers would be a logistical nightmare, trying to match every order to the correct serial number. As you can understand, once we\'re up to the fulfillment process, we want things to go as quickly as possible, so that we can get your watches out to you as fast as possible. Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:06 am EST When can I purchase additional straps? You’ll be able to purchase additional straps and other accessories once you’ve made your pledge. We’ll send you an email with details, so stay tuned for that ;). Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:08 am EST Do these watches come with a warranty? Yes, all LIV watches come with a five-year warranty, including the watches on this campaign! Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:08 am EST Will I be charged duties/customs when I receive my reward? Some countries charge an import duty for purchasing an item from overseas; we wish we had the power to eliminate that tax or charge, but unfortunately, we don\'t :(. We will do everything we can to minimize the amount, but we can\'t guarantee how much you’ll have to pay. Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:08 am EST How can multiple watches be purchased? If you want multiple watches, simply calculate the total amount for all the watches you’d like and then pledge that amount. For example, if you want a Saturn V Moon Lander ($370.00) and a Saturn V Moon Dust ($470.00), add the amounts together ($370.00 + $470.00 = $840.00), that will equal your pledge amount. Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:08 am EST What if I haven\'t received my confirmation message via email? If you have not received your confirmation message after 24 hours of making your pledge, please contact us at info@livwatches.com and we’ll direct you from there :). Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:11 am EST What are the dimensions of the watches? Fri, Nov 6 2020 6:15 pm EST Do the watches have a crystal skeleton back? The Saturn V Moon Dust has a crystal exhibition back through which you can see the precision automatic movement. Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:11 am EST Are straps from your other collections going to fit the watches in this campaign? Yes, our 22 mm straps will fit the Saturn V Moon Dust and our 23 mm straps will fit the Saturn V Moon Lander. Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:11 am EST What is the battery life for the Moon Lander? The Saturn V Moon Lander battery will last a cool 3+ years (38 months by ETA’s calculations) to keep up with your active lifestyle! Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:11 am EST How much do the watches weigh? Thu, Nov 5 2020 10:11 am EST Are the watches returnable? We are confident you’ll love your watch. However, on the off chance that you don’t, we offer a 90-day, no question asked return policy for a 100% store credit.  You can also exchange your watch within 90 days for an item of equal or lesser value. We believe it\'s the right, and the only way to go as a company. The LIV Way.

2978,1421647085,"[' The price seems high, what do I get for this price? Short answer: Quality in comfort, durability and practicality compared to other pillows, in addition to sustainable focus on the environment and worker rights. Also, as we believe quality also comes from motivated and proud seamstresses, and that protecting our environment is essential, we decided to source material locally, and produce the pillow in Norway. This ensures that all part of our product have to follow the most stringent environmental and worker right laws in the world, and we strive to show that quality is an important, and appreciated, attribute of our pillows. The price of the pillow reflects what making these commitments costs. If you have the same beliefs as we do, and want a pillow that works, and lasts for as long as you need it, then this is your pillow. Wed, Jul 15 2020 11:42 am EDT Is this pillow mostly for women? No. When I started out, I made this pillow to support me when I was pregnant, and when I was breastfeeding. But we have had this pillow in my inner circle of friends for the last four years, and there are just as many men as women that use it. My husband was the first to permanently ""borrow"" my pillow! This is actually the reason we have a reward with to pillows, and any person with a spouse or girl-/boyfriend need to get two, to avoid the ensuing arguments that follow having to share one. Wed, Jul 15 2020 11:33 am EDT What is unique about this pillow? Unlike existing triangle pillows, our Trangel pillow has foam normally used in out-door pillows in off-shore vessels out in the North Sea. The foam is made to breath well and keep its form during hard daily use. This makes the pillows last a lot longer, even under these extreme conditions. In addition, also unlike other pillows you can find in the market, our Trangel pillow has an inner protective cover, normally used to protect baby-mattresses. This is also a highly ventilating fabric, letting humidity escape easily, and prolonging the lifetime of the foam. The outer cover follow traditional Scandinavian aesthetic design, stylish and quality finish, with simple practical details like a handle to carry around, and pockets in our custom version. Together with our Scandinavian focus on environment and workers rights, our Trangel pillow is highly unique, both in sustainable production, form, quality, practicality and comfort.

3061,861818297,"["" Can this be used with an ultra short throw (UST) projector? Absolutely yes, this is actually the best way to play since you will have less shadows. Just make sure you mount the Limbic high enough to not have a shadow in your projection Wed, Dec 23 2020 3:06 am EST How accurate is the touch and how many gestures does it support at the same time? For example could two kids draw at the same time or move objects? The system will allow multi touch capabilities as well as up to ten objects at the same time. The final capablitly might be much higher also. Tue, Dec 22 2020 11:01 am EST How much free space (width and length) do you recommend to have to use Limbic properly? Even small setups are possible but we always recommended a minimum of three by three meters to have fun. We also have people sung the system in smaller spaces for the motion tracking games if you don't need the full workout effect of our game. Wed, Dec 23 2020 3:06 am EST How do I install it? With an app or is it already ready to play? You install the console to the wall or floor, set up the projection, connect it to the projector via HDMI and adjust your screen by tapping the symbols on the wall during setup. Connect it to WIFI and you're ready for fun. Wed, Dec 23 2020 3:06 am EST Can I link my Netflix account or fitness app like freeletics to it and how do I control it then? You can always use any other device on your projector's secondary input to have a full movie night experience. Wed, Dec 23 2020 3:06 am EST Is it portable so I can use it in different locations like taking it over to my friends house? Well, yes. But you'll have to attach it and run the setup again. Wed, Dec 23 2020 3:06 am EST Could the UST and LIMBIC both be on a low table or the floor? Yes, one of our next videos will also show this setup working with a stand for the LIMBIC. Wed, Dec 23 2020 3:06 am EST Does LIMBIC need to be centred above or below on the screen? As long as the longest distance to a point where you want to touch is less than three meters it's fine. Wed, Dec 23 2020 3:06 am EST How long can the cable to the projector be? This depends on the quality of your cable. A good one can easily reach distances of 15 meters and more and you can even have CAT5 solutions if this isn't enough. Just make sure you check for latency. Wed, Dec 23 2020 3:06 am EST Can LIMBIC track small balls such as tennis or ping pong? Any ball larger than 5cm is super safe to track, so tennis balls are no problem. We are also checking if we can further refine the sensor to also track smaller objects and will keep you updated on that. Wed, Dec 23 2020 3:06 am EST Are you planning to have games for tennis, ping pong, squash or racquetball, and basketball? We already have a good selection of games and are always happy for any ideas. For the larger systems for operators like inetractiveSQUASH, itneractiveRACQUETBALL or Multiball please check our other pages. Tue, Dec 22 2020 11:01 am EST Are there any constraints on room size or wall surface/construction? As long as we have a flat surface with no direct sunlight and a matte paint you're fine. Sat, Dec 26 2020 4:04 am EST Do the games run on the Limbic itself or a game console or a computer? If they run on Limbic how are they loaded (via WiFi, bluetooth, SD card, etc)? The games run on LIMBIC itself and the system is connected to the internet via WiFi or ethernet. Sat, Dec 26 2020 4:04 am EST Is an internet connection required to run the games (ie, can the games be run standalone with only Limbic and a projector or does Limbic need to be connected to your server to function)? In order to receive new games, LIMBIC needs to be connected to the Internet/ our server to access our App Store. Sat, Dec 26 2020 4:04 am EST How would users be notified of new games? On the Limbic menu, new games and training apps will always be highlighted. These can be downloaded or purchased just like you do with your smartphone. All our Kickstarter backers have lifetime access to these apps forever. Sat, Dec 26 2020 4:04 am EST Please provide a list / brief description of the currently available games and games in development (ie, coming next year) We will be updating that part of the website after the holidays. Until then, please have a look here: https://multi-ball.com/for_players#MultiBallexerciseGames these are our games that have been tested over the years without professional systems already. Sat, Dec 26 2020 4:04 am EST What kind of functionality would be maintained vs lost if an internet connection wasn't available or if your servers were down? The system itself can be used without an internet connection, but you would only have the pre-installed games available. Without an internet connection, you would not be able to update the software, games, training apps, or participate in online leader boards. Sat, Dec 26 2020 4:04 am EST Can I use wireless to connect Limbic and the projector? Yes, you can. You'd need an external signal converter though and we very much recommend checking the latency. Tue, Dec 29 2020 2:59 am EST Free lifetime premium subscription: If you decide to upgrade the hardware inside Limbic, will we need to buy a new Limbic? When we designed the LIMBIC we paid extra attention to having a lot of overhead when it comes to durability and performance. There won't be any reason for having to upgrade soon. With technology moving fast, however, there might be future generations of the system coming and we are already looking into ways to maybe solve that with partial upgrades or trade-in programs. Your backer subscription however will always be valid since it will be on your lifetime, not the hardware's lifetime ;) Tue, Dec 29 2020 2:59 am EST Could you please elaborate in how the sunlight affects Limbic sensors? We recommend having no direct sunlight on the playing surface while using LIMBIC. Our sensors still work with it, but the projection would not be visible. For the motion tracking, we work with a 3D depth camera which would be capable of also working while areas are lit up by natural sunlight. Tue, Dec 29 2020 2:59 am EST What is the security measures you have taken to avoid inappropriate access to limbic cameras? Our data security follows regulations and no stream is actually processed outside of the system or on our servers. The processing is only happening on the machine and no video is recorded. After some early feedback from the crowd, we are also designing a mechanical shutter, which will cover the lenses when Limbic is not in use - just because it feels better. We also have no microphone included since we can use your smartphone for any future functions like voice control that would require that. Tue, Dec 29 2020 2:59 am EST Have you considered to embed the projector inside Limbic? Even if the final device size would be bigger? Yes, we did. However, when we looked into this, most of the users we spoke to are using the projector for other things already. It is also very difficult to find a one-size-fits-all solution. So we decided to not include it in our product and give everybody the freedom of choice. Tue, Dec 29 2020 2:59 am EST Where can I watch the live streams of Q&A Sessions? Daily at 5 pm CET on Facebook, Twitch, Youtube and TikTok. Links to the channels on our Website: www.limbicactive.com/live Wed, Jan 6 2021 2:57 pm EST ?  ""]",23

Thu, Jul 9 2020 4:18 pm EDT Can Nabot go up/down the stairs? No, Nabot cannot go up/down the stair. Thu, Jul 9 2020 4:18 pm EDT Can Nabot detect if it is falling from the table? No, But to be safe you can program Nabot to get your permission before doing anything that might cause it to fall. Thu, Jul 9 2020 4:18 pm EDT Can I get an extra battery? Yes, As a matter of fact since we know how frustrating it is to wait for your battery to be charged. We included an extra battery for all purchases. So you can charge the extra while you play with Nabot. Thu, Jul 9 2020 4:18 pm EDT Does Nabot work without a connection to a phone, tablet, or a computer? No, Nabot’s processor is not powerful enough to run our neural networks. Therefore, it needs to be connected to a device to process camera images, etc. You can leave your phone to be connected to Nabot so that it can work continuously. We are also working on a feature where Nabot connects to our servers and the processing is done on the server. This would be an alternative solution to make Nabot work independently. Sat, Jul 11 2020 12:22 pm EDT Is it safe to operate Nabot around infants? You can program Nabot to turn away when it detects a certain object. However, we recommend adult supervision all the time.

However, you can tape things such as a vacuum cleaner to it. Thu, Jul 9 2020 4:18 pm EDT Can Nabot understand my voice commands? Can it speak? Nabot cannot understand voice commands at this time but you can program it to speak based on what is happening around it. We are working on voice recognition feature and connecting Nabot to Alexa.

You will be able to swap items for items of the same or similar value once the campaign is over. We will contact you when this is possible to ensure you get the products you want! Tue, Mar 17 2020 12:29 pm EDT Are your products for all skin types? We strive to create the best products for both you and the planet. That's why we create products that are mild on the skin and don't cause allergic reactions. If you have a specific allergy please read through our ingredient list in the FAQ or send us a message. We don't use synthetic dyes or fragrances but natural ingredients and oils. Wed, Apr 1 2020 7:02 am EDT What properties does your products have? Wed, Apr 1 2020 7:02 am EDT What is in your products? Please see below for a full ingredient list of our products: Wed, Apr 1 2020 7:02 am EDT What is your packaging made of? We only ship plastic-free, and carbon offset! All of our boxes and dunnage are either fully or partly recycled. Wed, Apr 1 2020 7:02 am EDT What is your refill packaging made of? Our new product line's packaging contains 4 simple main ingredients:  recycled paper, glass, PLA, PHA and Ocean recovered plastics. All of our refills and toothpaste tubes are made from recycled paper and PHA. PHA stands for polyhydroxyalkanoate and is produced naturally by bacteria feeding on sugars, vegetable oils, starches or mixed organic waste. It is compostable and marine-degradable once its useful life is over. This results in a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, plastic pollution and toxic effects on land and in the ocean. Our refillable cleaning bottles are made from PLA a fully biobased bioplastic that is biodegradable and can even be recycled, we chose to make it out of PLA instead of glass because it will be carried around the house and needed to be shatterproof. All other packaging is made from glass which is endlessly recyclable ♻️. Wed, Apr 1 2020 7:02 am EDT Can I use my own bottles and just buy the refills? Definitely! if you already have some bottle you love you can just swap the refillable bottles for refills when we send out our survey. Wed, Apr 1 2020 7:02 am EDT How do i contact you? Send us a message at hello@vove.co and we will reply as fast as we can. Wed, Apr 1 2020 7:02 am EDT How does your shipping work? We will ship out all orders as soon as they are done, we have fulfillment partners in Europe, Asia, and North America to shorten the distance each order needs to travel, this lowers emissions and the shipping prices for you. Of course, this doesn't stop us from carbon-offsetting the whole order, and only shipping plastic free! Wed, Apr 1 2020 7:02 am EDT ?  ""]",10

3109,11243100,"["" Is the Plaato app free? Yes! You can download it now if you want from Google Play or App Store. Tue, Jun 4 2019 11:10 am EDT How does it connect to my phone? Plaato Keg connects to your home WiFi network. Use the Plaato app to set it up and see data from the device. Tue, Jun 4 2019 11:10 am EDT How many Plaato Kegs can I add in the app? As many as you want. Tue, Jun 4 2019 11:10 am EDT How much does it build up? Will it fit in my kegerator? 1 inch. Or 25mm. Check out the dimensions in the campaign for the full specs. Make sure you will have space on top of the keg for tubes and connection. We are measuring weight, so try to avoid squeezing on tubes that pushes down on the keg. Tue, Jun 4 2019 11:10 am EDT What USB charger can I use to power the Plaato Keg? Any USB adapter with 1A or more will work. A special 3 meter USB cable is included. Tue, Jun 4 2019 11:10 am EDT If I stand on the Plaato Keg and pee, will it tell me how much I have peed? First of all, thank you very much for this question. Yes, down to a resolution of 10mL. And yes, we have tried it. But please don't stand on it if you weight more than 60kg (132 lbs). Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT If this product is so cool, why hasn’t anyone made it before? Good question. It is cool and we are hopefully making it now. Share our campaign with your beer brewing friends and make this product a reality. Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT Will the pour measurements be ok if I get a lot of foam? Yes! On of the advantages of measuring weight over flow meters is that you will get correct measurements even though you fill a glass with foam. Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT Does it work with cider, soda and other drinks? Of course! Just set the final gravity to the liquid’s density in the app to get a correct conversion from weight to volume. If you don’t know it exactly, 1.010g/cm3 is a good guess for beer and cider. Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT I already have a Plaato Airlock. Will I need to download another app? Nope, same app. Just set up the Plaato Keg and you will see both your Airlock and Keg in the app. Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT Does it handle cold temperatures? Yes, it is built for kegerators and can handle temperatures down to -10°C (14°F). Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT Can I clean it? Yes! Clean the device with a damp cloth. Don’t put it in your dishwasher. Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT What countries do you ship to? Pretty much world-wide: Australia, Austria, Argentina, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Canary, Islands, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Jersey, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT How big kegs can I use? Maximum 50L (13 gal) kegs. The total weight capacity is 60kg (132 lbs). Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT Will it fit my keg? Kegs come in many shapes and sizes, so we tried to build the Plaato Keg to fit most of them. See the dimensions to be 100% sure. Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT How can you know volumes by measuring weight? Luckily, brewers tend to know the density (gravity) of their beer and converting to volume is straight forward. If you have not entered a final gravity for the beer in the app, we will use a default value of 1.010 g/cm3. If you are using the device to measure amounts of water while brewing, simply change the FG input to 1.000 g/cm3 or choose to display the direct weight measurements. Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT I am a developer. Can I integrate Plaato to my own app? Yes! Integration will be possible and will be similar to the Plaato Airlock. You can check the docs here. Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT I have more than one keg, will I need a Plaato Keg for each one? If you want to monitor them at the same time you should get one for each. Also, you can use one for your CO2-tank! We have good discounts if you want more than one. Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT Will it work on my home WiFi network? Yes. Any regular home wifi network with a 2.4GHz band. Enterprise networks or networks with a login portal will not work. Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT What units are you using? The app lets you choose between metric units or American units. Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT Does it measure the temperature in my kegerator? We have included a temperature sensor inside the device to monitor the device’s temperature and it will be available in the app with current and historical data. The device will be slightly warmer than its surroundings due to heat from the WiFi chip, but you can use it as an indication to what your kegerator temperature is. Keep in mind that temperatures inside a fridge varies greatly depending on where you measure, so you have to consider where the device is placed. Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT Will you have integrations to other brewing apps? We believe that your data should be accessible to you. We therefore support integrations so that you can route the data to your favorite brewing app or your own server. Third-party brewing apps can make their own integrations so that you get data from Plaato in your favorite brewing app. Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT How is the WiFi reception inside my fridge? Pretty good! We are using the 2.4GHz WiFi band, which is better at penetrating walls than 5GHz networks. If your router is not too far away from your kegerator you will have a good connection. Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT How does it work? The Plaato Keg has three weight cells that measures the total weight of your keg. Data is transmitted to the cloud through your home WiFi network and is displayed in the Plaato app. The weight can be tared from the app, and you can set the weight of the empty keg. If you enter the gravity of your beer in the app, you can also see how much beer you have in liters or gallons. Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT Can I use it to weigh ingredients during brewing? Of course! It can be hard to get the correct volumes of water etc during brewing and The Plaato Keg turned out to be a handy tool while brewing. We use the Final Gravity that you put in the app to convert from weight to volume. Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT Can I use this as a scale for something completely different? Yes! It may say “beer left” in the app, but other than that you can use it for whatever you want. One in our team used a Plaato Keg prototype for mixing concrete when renovating his apartment. It turned out pretty shitty, but that’s just what happens when programmers try to do something practical. Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT I have more questions. Can I contact you? Of course! Write us here on Kickstarter so others also can read the answer as well. We also use our Facebook account where you can chat directly with us. If you happen to be in Norway, let us know and stop by our office in the center of Oslo! Maybe you have a great idea for another product for brewers? Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT ?  ""]",27

We love the Austin Animal Center and Humane Society deeply, and will initially house their cats.  All adoption fees will go through them. Sat, Apr 11 2015 4:21 am EDT Where will the place be located? We will be located in Austin.  Parking and space size is more important than being downtown.  We have high hopes though.  We are keeping our options open so if we raise more money we can have a bigger, better space!  Literally all Kickstarter money goes to space and buildout.  Therefore, the more we make, the more room for you and kitty. You are literally building our walls, which is why everyone who pledges will have their name on them!

Everyone who chooses a shirt option will be contacted about their preference and size:)  Stay connected here: https://www.facebook.com/thebluecatcafe/ Thu, Feb 19 2015 12:43 pm EST Will you charge for kitty petting? Kitty love comes free, but they do have real needs. Housing, food, supervisory care in the cattery adds up. We will charge a fee to cover our costs.  All adoption fees go to the rescues they come from. Sun, Apr 12 2015 5:20 am EDT Can I visit if I don't want to adopt? Absolutely!  That's the idea.  Many of us can't have cats for whatever reason.  We just want you to come hang out, and be here with us.  Sometimes being around humans and being social is all a lonely animal needs....including kitties! Thu, Feb 19 2015 12:48 pm EST Can I bring my cat? Sorry.  This place will only be a place for rescued kitties who have no real home, and looking for one.  Trust us though, your cat wants you to leave him at home so he can catch up on all the shows you can't agree on:) Sun, Apr 12 2015 10:45 pm EDT Can I eat and drink alongside the kitties? At this point kitties will be indoors, and food and trucks out back on an awesome patio.  We will work to marry the two so that you can eat and drink with kitty. Sun, Apr 12 2015 5:20 am EDT Why are you going vegan? Some people are really upset we are going vegan.  Why is that?  Veganism isn't meant to exclude anyone, and we promise we won't push it on you.  Our goal is just to be yummy or your money back...while hurting no animals in the process.  We believe this place is built on love and respect for animals, and we are making as compassionate of decisions as we can for them. Sat, Apr 11 2015 4:27 am EDT Is this place non-profit? No.  Kickstarter does not allow charity projects. Crowdfunding is for building cool dreams and ideas through small donations when other options are limited.  We will foster kitties, and adoption fees will go throught the rescues we represent at the time of fostering.  Blue Cat Cafe is an LLC. Sun, Apr 12 2015 5:17 am EDT What do we do if we hit $60K? Based on money raised, we will choose the best option for most human and kitty space.  Please vote with your dollar for a bigger, better place!!! Sat, Apr 11 2015 4:27 am EDT ?  ""]",10

Each batch yield will vary a little (depending on the nuts, seeds or veg you use) but in general you'll make about 1-1.5 cups of cheese which for me generally translates to three small wheels or two larger ones. You can easily cut the recipe or double it. You can also add more water if you want a thinner sauce or softer cheese and that will increase your yield. Wed, Jun 8 2016 3:41 pm EDT WILL I NEED TO MAKE REJUVELAC OR ANYTHING ELSE TIME CONSUMING? Nope!

A little longer: This volume starts with a lead-in on earlier forays of the Walt Disney Company into animation for television and follows through to the 1980's, when Michael Eisner took the seat at the company as CEO in 1984. From that point on the actual history of the division starts. This volume will cover that history from 1984 to 1993. From sharing one small room with three people to a studio that employs a few hundred artists, setting up and owning four overseas studios, this volume covers the development and production of the following series and the special projects in-between: Further more, there will be a chapter on the creation of the Movietoons label and their first production DuckTales the Movie - Treasure of the Lost Lamp (1990) and other discarded Movietoons projects. The final chapter covers the projects that the studio started developing, but that never went beyond pre-production. These chapters will contain never before seen artwork and show descriptions. Some being developed to just the show pitch, while others went on to the scripting phase of production and stopped there. The goal of the book is not only to talk about the series themselves, but also about the people who developed, wrote, designed, story boarded, timed, recorded and animated these productions into shows we all know and love. Wed, Apr 27 2016 9:19 am EDT What do you mean with 'special projects'? While the division was at work on the many series it produced, there would often be smaller projects in-between.

We\'ve even heard from people that they plan to acquire an iPad just to get this collection! However, due to the massive interest in the back catalogue, we are looking in to other options. We are taking all of your thoughts and suggestions seriously, and are currently looking into cross-platform compatible distribution.

Once the the Cinefex Classic Collection is available on in the AppStore in January 2014, you will have the opportunity to purchase individual issues for $4.99 each, a much higher per issue price than if you contribute now.

Even if you haven\'t bought or downloaded any issues to your iPad, you will still be able to search all of the text in all of issues 1–126 from within the (free) app. The app\'s database contains all of the articles, so you don\'t even have to be online! You will have the ability to freely download, archive and re-download issues you have bought as needed. Fri, Jul 26 2013 3:35 pm EDT Do I need an Internet connection to read the articles or to search the articles? Nothing in any of issues 1–126 require an Internet connection for anything other than to download the issue(s) to the iPad. Even if you don\'t have any issues downloaded, you will still be able to search the entire article archive without an Internet connection, as the app has the full article database embedded. Wed, Aug 7 2013 7:33 pm EDT If I delete an issue from my iPad, can I download it again for free? You can download, delete and then re-download each issue that you have pledged for (or bought individually via an in-app purchase) as many times as you like on all your iPads.

Hello :) Thanks for commenting, fair question. I’m definitely not claiming that I’m going to write music that’s going to fix anything, and I don’t think that adoptees are broken, but I do think many of them will have missed out on early life experiences. I’m not sure whether this would apply to you, not knowing your situation or where you are from, but children in the UK are almost all adopted from the care system and have been removed from biological parents for various reasons. My son for example was often left alone as a baby (among other things), so he missed out on loads of early communication experiences that other babies would have had. Infant-directed speech is pretty well documented in developmental psychology and there’s plenty of research in to early communication and development. I’m basing my project on the work of Colwyn Trevarthen and Stephen Malloch, if you want to look it up. Malloch coined the term ‘communicative musicality’ to refer to the musical features of infant-directed speech, and multiple studies have shown these to be consistent across different cultures - so to my mind they must serve a purpose for supporting early brain development, be it forming building blocks for social interactions, communications, bonding with parents, or whatever. As my son missed out on a lot of this sort of thing, I’d quite like to see whether I can give him some of these experiences now, to help ‘fill in’ the developmental gaps, as it were. (This is the current thinking in the UK adoption system, to try and parent in a therapeutic way.) However my son is nearly nine and even though developmentally he’s a lot younger it’s not really appropriate to do baby talk with him all the time - hence why I had the idea of taking the musical features of infant-directed speech to see whether I could incorporate them in to new music that was suitable for a child of his age. I don’t really know what’s going to happen, but I think it’s an experiment worth doing, and maybe it will lead on to something more or a proper research project. I just thought that if a child is adopted at 4 or 5, having had not the best start to life, that this might be one way of helping the parents and child to bond, and hopefully helping that child get some of the benefits of the early communication experiences that most babies will have. I don’t know whether that will happen, to be honest, but figure it’s worth a try. At the very least there will be an album of lovely music for families to enjoy together, and that’s no bad thing in itself :) Thu, Aug 9 2018 6:56 am EDT ?  ']",1

3329,1636681195,"["" I’M NEW TO KICKSTARTER AND DON’T THINK I HAVE AN ACCOUNT. CAN I STILL PLEDGE? Yes! It’s easy to support Where Excuses Go to Die via Kickstarter, and if you have an Amazon.com account you’re already halfway there. And don’t worry if you don’t; we’ll walk you through every step: 1. First off, please know that your pledge will remain a pledge until August 11 when this campaign ends – and even then, you won’t be charged anything unless we meet our $7,000 goal in time. If our project isn't successfully funded, which would make us sad, no one will pay anything. You can also change or cancel your pledge any time before the end of this project. 2. Once you’ve decided how much you’d like to donate and which reward you’d like to receive, click on the box containing that reward amount and description (in the right hand sidebar). 3. You’ll first be prompted to confirm your pledge amount and reward. If everything looks right, click “Continue to Next Step.” 4. You’ll be taken to a screen that lets you login if you have an existing Kickstarter account OR lets you set up a new Kickstarter account (you also have a third option to login with Facebook). We recommend filling out the form under the heading “New to Kickstarter?” in the middle column (you’ll be asked to input your name, email, and a password). Then click the green button that reads, “Sign me up.” 5. Now you’re the proud owner of a Kickstarter account – but you’re not finished yet! You’ll next be taken to a page that reads, “Check out with Amazon.” Here again you can verify your pledge amount and reward; if all looks good please click the green button that says, “Continue to Amazon.” Don’t worry if you don’t have an Amazon account: you’ll be given a chance to create one in order to make your pledge. 6. The next page you see contains both Kickstarter and Amazon logos. This is where, if you HAVE an existing Amazon account, you can simply put in your email address and your Amazon password. Remember that your Amazon password is probably different from the password you just created for Kickstarter – and be sure that if Amazon prepopulated an email address for you it’s the correct one. If you can’t remember whether or not you have an Amazon account or if you’re sure you DON’T have an Amazon account, please input your correct email address, select the radio button that says, “I am a new customer” and then press “Sign in using our secure server.” [PLEASE NOTE: Amazon has a much better memory than most people we know. If you’ve ever bought anything on Amazon, you probably have an Amazon account that you’ve forgotten about. But fear not – Amazon will tell you this! If the email address you enter for them is already on file, they will give you the opportunity to have a password reminder sent to that email address. You can then follow those directions to log directly into your existing Amazon account and continue with your Kickstarter pledge (see step 8, below.] 7. Just like Kickstarter did, Amazon will prompt new users to provide a name, email address, and password. If it makes your life easier, you CAN use the same name and password you provided to Kickstarter. 8. Next, Amazon will take you to a series of pages asking you to input your billing information (a valid credit card is required here). Remember that you’re not actually being charged at this time, but Amazon will securely keep your account on file. (Feel free to look up their stellar security record.) 9. Hit submit, and Congratulations! You’ll be taken to a page that fully confirms your Kickstarter pledge and acknowledges you as an official backer of Where Excuses Go to Die. You can choose to share your pledge with others via social media or simply close out of the window. You’re done and we thank you for taking the steps needed to make your pledge.

Maeve Bradley, my daughter, is the Photography Editor.  She is a third year student at the University of Virginia majoring in Studio Art with an emphasis in Photography. I am Stuart Bradley, the Publisher.  I do the layout of the books using Adobe InDesign and Photoshop and market the books.  I am a retired lawyer.  We use The Book Patch to print the  books, they are based in Arizona. Sat, Feb 3 2018 7:48 am EST What About the Photographs in the Books? There are a total of about 150 photographs in the two books.  Most of them are 3 by 3 inch prints that I scanned at 300 dpi and are printed as 6 by 6 inch photographs in the two volumes.  I did this so you can see the detail in these photos.  I used Photoshop to clean up the photos but in many cases there are still scratches.  These are NOT fine photography books. To my knowledge these photographs have never been published before.  They were all taken in the 1942 to 1945 time period and I have had possession of them for about 40 years.  I always planned on doing something with my father\'s letters and photographs but had to wait until I retired and started this little publishing company. Sat, Feb 3 2018 7:48 am EST When will I Receive the Books? Volume One is nearly ready and will be mailed out the third week of February, (if the campaign is successful) as soon as I have your address.  Volume Two will be mailed in March.  Books will be sent by Media Mail to United States addresses at no additional cost. Backers with International addresses will be charged $10 for shipping and it will be by First Class Mail.  Volume One will be sent in February, Volume Two in March. The sets of books (Volume One & Two sent together) for college and university libraries will be sent in March together with a gift letter that you will receive a copy of, if you chose that reward. Thu, Dec 21 2017 3:53 pm EST How Will the List of Schools be Decided? After the end of the campaign I will send out surveys. Those backers that paid for sets of books to be sent to a college or university library will get first choice of schools. If there is duplication  the earlier pledge will take preference and I will inform the later pledge that they need to choose another school. When that process is complete I will look at the nominations made in the ""Comments"" section of this campaign and come up with the rest of the schools that will receive sets of books.  These will mostly be in the United States because of the cost of postage.  I will try and balance geography and small colleges versus large universities.  I will also seek to have half of the schools be HBCUs. I will publish the list of schools in early March so everyone can see those chosen. Thank you Sun, Dec 31 2017 7:50 am EST ?  ']",4

The STL files will be released as early as possible but this will at least be after final modifications are made to the electronics board.  This is so the electronics board will be certain to mount properly.  The STL files for some parts that are unlikely to change much, such as the turntable and laser support arms, will be released even earlier.

It is theoretically possible to increase the scan volume by adding another frame segment (the parts between the camera and table) to the scanner.

Of course, we're happy to send you one if you want to pledge an additional $25!!! Wed, Nov 28 2018 2:00 pm EST Why would I use the MicroFinder app when I can just Google it? First and foremost, because Google doesn't curate the results for you. When you use the MicroFinder app, you will find only independently-owned distilleries and authentic craft spirits. We do the work of finding them for you, so all you have to do is pull up the app and enjoy! Furthermore, MicroFinder is much more than just a map. You can also search our database of craft spirits, check out ratings and rate them yourself, and save everything in My Bar. And we're just getting started! Become a backer and see what other amazing features are yet to come in MicroFinder! Wed, Nov 28 2018 1:59 pm EST ?  ""]",3

3401,254331115,"[' What is the difference between Brioche and DK Brioche? Double-knitted brioche is worked in one pass, using the two colours together, and working every single stitch, as opposed to trad brioche, where you only use one colour at a time, and have to work two passes for every single row. DK brioche creates a fabric that differs from trad brioche quite significantly. This is because as they create the stitches and the yarnovers, the two yarns interact with each other in a very different way. Not only is the fabric more condensed in terms of row gauge, but when I\'ve shown the two side by side, many people have exclaimed at how much neater they think the DK brioche fabric is. That, however, as far as I am concerned is something that pales into insignificance next to the fact that DK brioche can be ONE HUNDRED PER CENT REVERSIBLE, in a way that trad brioche just can\'t achieve. As a double-knitter, that\'s my holy grail, and can only be accomplished with DK brioche. Sat, Oct 12 2019 11:21 am EDT Is DK brioche the same as One-Pass brioche? No, it\'s not. One-pass brioche, as the name suggests, is a method of creating the traditional brioche fabric without having to work two passes for every row. It\'s a perfectly possible and viable way of working trad brioche, and there will be a whole section of the eBook devoted to it. What it is NOT, however, is the same as DK brioche, which has a completely different structure, and can be 100% reversible, in a way that trad brioche cannot. Sat, Oct 12 2019 11:27 am EDT When will the eBook be ready? I don\'t want to stick a hard and fast date on this at the moment, as it depends on a great many factors, but I am hoping it will be ready sometime in May or June, 2020. Sat, Oct 12 2019 11:27 am EDT Who is publishing the eBook? I am planning to do as much of the work as I can myself. There are some aspects of book publishing that require skills that I don\'t yet have, but I\'m very confident that they are things that I will be perfectly capable of picking up between now and when I need to implement them! Sat, Oct 12 2019 11:27 am EDT Who is this eBook aimed at? This eBook is aimed at anyone at all with a keen interest in furthering their knowledge of what is possible in knitting. It\'s not for absolute beginners, you\'ll definitely need to know the basics of knitting to get the best out of this book, but if you\'ve ever looked at brioche before, and said to yourself, ""I\'d like to have a go at that, but it looks really hard,"" then this might just be what you are looking for. I genuinely believe that DK brioche is much easier to learn than trad brioche. Sat, Oct 12 2019 11:41 am EDT ?  ']",5
