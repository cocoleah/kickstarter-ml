61,3061,"["" Can this be used with an ultra short throw (UST) projector? Absolutely yes, this is actually the best way to play since you will have less shadows. Just make sure you mount the Limbic high enough to not have a shadow in your projection Wed, Dec 23 2020 3:06 am EST How accurate is the touch and how many gestures does it support at the same time? For example could two kids draw at the same time or move objects? The system will allow multi touch capabilities as well as up to ten objects at the same time. The final capablitly might be much higher also. Tue, Dec 22 2020 11:01 am EST How much free space (width and length) do you recommend to have to use Limbic properly? Even small setups are possible but we always recommended a minimum of three by three meters to have fun. We also have people sung the system in smaller spaces for the motion tracking games if you don't need the full workout effect of our game. Wed, Dec 23 2020 3:06 am EST How do I install it? With an app or is it already ready to play? You install the console to the wall or floor, set up the projection, connect it to the projector via HDMI and adjust your screen by tapping the symbols on the wall during setup. Connect it to WIFI and you're ready for fun. Wed, Dec 23 2020 3:06 am EST Can I link my Netflix account or fitness app like freeletics to it and how do I control it then? You can always use any other device on your projector's secondary input to have a full movie night experience. Wed, Dec 23 2020 3:06 am EST Is it portable so I can use it in different locations like taking it over to my friends house? Well, yes. But you'll have to attach it and run the setup again. Wed, Dec 23 2020 3:06 am EST Could the UST and LIMBIC both be on a low table or the floor? Yes, one of our next videos will also show this setup working with a stand for the LIMBIC. Wed, Dec 23 2020 3:06 am EST Does LIMBIC need to be centred above or below on the screen? As long as the longest distance to a point where you want to touch is less than three meters it's fine. Wed, Dec 23 2020 3:06 am EST How long can the cable to the projector be? This depends on the quality of your cable. A good one can easily reach distances of 15 meters and more and you can even have CAT5 solutions if this isn't enough. Just make sure you check for latency. Wed, Dec 23 2020 3:06 am EST Can LIMBIC track small balls such as tennis or ping pong? Any ball larger than 5cm is super safe to track, so tennis balls are no problem. We are also checking if we can further refine the sensor to also track smaller objects and will keep you updated on that. Wed, Dec 23 2020 3:06 am EST Are you planning to have games for tennis, ping pong, squash or racquetball, and basketball? We already have a good selection of games and are always happy for any ideas. For the larger systems for operators like inetractiveSQUASH, itneractiveRACQUETBALL or Multiball please check our other pages. Tue, Dec 22 2020 11:01 am EST Are there any constraints on room size or wall surface/construction? As long as we have a flat surface with no direct sunlight and a matte paint you're fine. Sat, Dec 26 2020 4:04 am EST Do the games run on the Limbic itself or a game console or a computer? If they run on Limbic how are they loaded (via WiFi, bluetooth, SD card, etc)? The games run on LIMBIC itself and the system is connected to the internet via WiFi or ethernet. Sat, Dec 26 2020 4:04 am EST Is an internet connection required to run the games (ie, can the games be run standalone with only Limbic and a projector or does Limbic need to be connected to your server to function)? In order to receive new games, LIMBIC needs to be connected to the Internet/ our server to access our App Store. Sat, Dec 26 2020 4:04 am EST How would users be notified of new games? On the Limbic menu, new games and training apps will always be highlighted. These can be downloaded or purchased just like you do with your smartphone. All our Kickstarter backers have lifetime access to these apps forever. Sat, Dec 26 2020 4:04 am EST Please provide a list / brief description of the currently available games and games in development (ie, coming next year) We will be updating that part of the website after the holidays. Until then, please have a look here: https://multi-ball.com/for_players#MultiBallexerciseGames these are our games that have been tested over the years without professional systems already. Sat, Dec 26 2020 4:04 am EST What kind of functionality would be maintained vs lost if an internet connection wasn't available or if your servers were down? The system itself can be used without an internet connection, but you would only have the pre-installed games available. Without an internet connection, you would not be able to update the software, games, training apps, or participate in online leader boards. Sat, Dec 26 2020 4:04 am EST Can I use wireless to connect Limbic and the projector? Yes, you can. You'd need an external signal converter though and we very much recommend checking the latency. Tue, Dec 29 2020 2:59 am EST Free lifetime premium subscription: If you decide to upgrade the hardware inside Limbic, will we need to buy a new Limbic? When we designed the LIMBIC we paid extra attention to having a lot of overhead when it comes to durability and performance. There won't be any reason for having to upgrade soon. With technology moving fast, however, there might be future generations of the system coming and we are already looking into ways to maybe solve that with partial upgrades or trade-in programs. Your backer subscription however will always be valid since it will be on your lifetime, not the hardware's lifetime ;) Tue, Dec 29 2020 2:59 am EST Could you please elaborate in how the sunlight affects Limbic sensors? We recommend having no direct sunlight on the playing surface while using LIMBIC. Our sensors still work with it, but the projection would not be visible. For the motion tracking, we work with a 3D depth camera which would be capable of also working while areas are lit up by natural sunlight. Tue, Dec 29 2020 2:59 am EST What is the security measures you have taken to avoid inappropriate access to limbic cameras? Our data security follows regulations and no stream is actually processed outside of the system or on our servers. The processing is only happening on the machine and no video is recorded. After some early feedback from the crowd, we are also designing a mechanical shutter, which will cover the lenses when Limbic is not in use - just because it feels better. We also have no microphone included since we can use your smartphone for any future functions like voice control that would require that. Tue, Dec 29 2020 2:59 am EST Have you considered to embed the projector inside Limbic? Even if the final device size would be bigger? Yes, we did. However, when we looked into this, most of the users we spoke to are using the projector for other things already. It is also very difficult to find a one-size-fits-all solution. So we decided to not include it in our product and give everybody the freedom of choice. Tue, Dec 29 2020 2:59 am EST Where can I watch the live streams of Q&A Sessions? Daily at 5 pm CET on Facebook, Twitch, Youtube and TikTok. Links to the channels on our Website: www.limbicactive.com/live Wed, Jan 6 2021 2:57 pm EST ?  ""]"

To pledge to this project, follow the easy steps below: Sat, Jul 11 2020 12:23 pm EDT Do you ship worldwide? How much shipping costs? Yes, we do. Shipping for a single unit inside U.S. costs 15$ and shipping to the rest of the world costs 30$. Thu, Jul 9 2020 4:18 pm EDT When does shipping address information will be collected? At the end of the campaign. Thu, Jul 9 2020 4:18 pm EDT Why does Nabot look like a Mebo 2.0? Nabot is an upgraded Mebo 2.0 that is smart and autonomous with a coding interface. Thu, Jul 9 2020 4:18 pm EDT Does Nabot need to be connected to the internet to work? Internet connection is only needed when you log in to the app. After that Nabot can work offline. Thu, Jul 9 2020 4:18 pm EDT Can Nabot go up/down the stairs? No, Nabot cannot go up/down the stair. Thu, Jul 9 2020 4:18 pm EDT Can Nabot detect if it is falling from the table? No, But to be safe you can program Nabot to get your permission before doing anything that might cause it to fall. Thu, Jul 9 2020 4:18 pm EDT Can I get an extra battery? Yes, As a matter of fact since we know how frustrating it is to wait for your battery to be charged. We included an extra battery for all purchases. So you can charge the extra while you play with Nabot. Thu, Jul 9 2020 4:18 pm EDT Does Nabot work without a connection to a phone, tablet, or a computer? No, Nabot’s processor is not powerful enough to run our neural networks. Therefore, it needs to be connected to a device to process camera images, etc. You can leave your phone to be connected to Nabot so that it can work continuously. We are also working on a feature where Nabot connects to our servers and the processing is done on the server. This would be an alternative solution to make Nabot work independently. Sat, Jul 11 2020 12:22 pm EDT Is it safe to operate Nabot around infants? You can program Nabot to turn away when it detects a certain object. However, we recommend adult supervision all the time. Thu, Jul 9 2020 4:18 pm EDT Is it safe to operate Nabot around pets? Nabot can always be stopped from the mobile application. If you would like to program it to play with your pet, be ready to act fast in emergency situations. Thu, Jul 9 2020 4:18 pm EDT Can I control Nabot from anywhere in the world through Internet connection? Not at this time but we are working on it. Sat, Jul 11 2020 12:22 pm EDT Is the software expandable? Yes. We provide some AI functions that can detect and recognize objects, send movement commands to the robot, and receive the camera image and state of the robot, etc. You can expand these in Python using other AI libraries. Thu, Jul 9 2020 4:18 pm EDT Is the hardware expandable? Nabot is not a modular robot. For instance, a custom gripper cannot be attached to it. However, you can tape things such as a vacuum cleaner to it. Thu, Jul 9 2020 4:18 pm EDT Can Nabot understand my voice commands? Can it speak? Nabot cannot understand voice commands at this time but you can program it to speak based on what is happening around it. We are working on voice recognition feature and connecting Nabot to Alexa. Sat, Jul 11 2020 12:22 pm EDT How long does it take for the battery to be charged? 3-4 hours. Thu, Jul 9 2020 4:18 pm EDT Can I connect Nabot to Alexa/Google Assistant? Not at this time but we are working on it. Sat, Jul 11 2020 12:22 pm EDT Is Nabot fragile? Not at all, during our internal development and testing, Nabot went through a lot. Anything from falling off a table, bumping to the wall, etc happened to him and he still operates. Thu, Jul 9 2020 4:18 pm EDT Will this work with Android/iOS? Yes, our android application is what you see in the videos and we keep adding new features and polish existing ones continuously. Our iOS app is under development and will be ready before we ship the robots. Thu, Jul 9 2020 4:18 pm EDT I have a Mebo 2.0 robot. Can I use the Nabot AI app to program it? Not at this time but stay tuned, we might have a solution for you in the future. Sat, Jul 11 2020 12:22 pm EDT Is Nabot waterproof? No, it is not.

In the case they break or otherwise get destroyed they can all be recycled, even the ones made from bioplastic! Tue, Mar 17 2020 12:19 pm EDT Why can't i swap/change my items? You will be able to swap items for items of the same or similar value once the campaign is over. We will contact you when this is possible to ensure you get the products you want! Tue, Mar 17 2020 12:29 pm EDT Are your products for all skin types? We strive to create the best products for both you and the planet. That's why we create products that are mild on the skin and don't cause allergic reactions. If you have a specific allergy please read through our ingredient list in the FAQ or send us a message. We don't use synthetic dyes or fragrances but natural ingredients and oils. Wed, Apr 1 2020 7:02 am EDT What properties does your products have? Wed, Apr 1 2020 7:02 am EDT What is in your products? Please see below for a full ingredient list of our products: Wed, Apr 1 2020 7:02 am EDT What is your packaging made of? We only ship plastic-free, and carbon offset! All of our boxes and dunnage are either fully or partly recycled. Wed, Apr 1 2020 7:02 am EDT What is your refill packaging made of? Our new product line's packaging contains 4 simple main ingredients:  recycled paper, glass, PLA, PHA and Ocean recovered plastics. All of our refills and toothpaste tubes are made from recycled paper and PHA. PHA stands for polyhydroxyalkanoate and is produced naturally by bacteria feeding on sugars, vegetable oils, starches or mixed organic waste. It is compostable and marine-degradable once its useful life is over. This results in a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, plastic pollution and toxic effects on land and in the ocean. Our refillable cleaning bottles are made from PLA a fully biobased bioplastic that is biodegradable and can even be recycled, we chose to make it out of PLA instead of glass because it will be carried around the house and needed to be shatterproof. All other packaging is made from glass which is endlessly recyclable ♻️. Wed, Apr 1 2020 7:02 am EDT Can I use my own bottles and just buy the refills? Definitely! if you already have some bottle you love you can just swap the refillable bottles for refills when we send out our survey. Wed, Apr 1 2020 7:02 am EDT How do i contact you? Send us a message at hello@vove.co and we will reply as fast as we can. Wed, Apr 1 2020 7:02 am EDT How does your shipping work? We will ship out all orders as soon as they are done, we have fulfillment partners in Europe, Asia, and North America to shorten the distance each order needs to travel, this lowers emissions and the shipping prices for you. Of course, this doesn't stop us from carbon-offsetting the whole order, and only shipping plastic free! Wed, Apr 1 2020 7:02 am EDT ?  ""]"

109,3109,"["" Is the Plaato app free? Yes! You can download it now if you want from Google Play or App Store. Tue, Jun 4 2019 11:10 am EDT How does it connect to my phone? Plaato Keg connects to your home WiFi network. Use the Plaato app to set it up and see data from the device. Tue, Jun 4 2019 11:10 am EDT How many Plaato Kegs can I add in the app? As many as you want. Tue, Jun 4 2019 11:10 am EDT How much does it build up? Will it fit in my kegerator? 1 inch. Or 25mm. Check out the dimensions in the campaign for the full specs. Make sure you will have space on top of the keg for tubes and connection. We are measuring weight, so try to avoid squeezing on tubes that pushes down on the keg. Tue, Jun 4 2019 11:10 am EDT What USB charger can I use to power the Plaato Keg? Any USB adapter with 1A or more will work. A special 3 meter USB cable is included. Tue, Jun 4 2019 11:10 am EDT If I stand on the Plaato Keg and pee, will it tell me how much I have peed? First of all, thank you very much for this question. Yes, down to a resolution of 10mL. And yes, we have tried it. But please don't stand on it if you weight more than 60kg (132 lbs). Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT If this product is so cool, why hasn’t anyone made it before? Good question. It is cool and we are hopefully making it now. Share our campaign with your beer brewing friends and make this product a reality. Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT Will the pour measurements be ok if I get a lot of foam? Yes! On of the advantages of measuring weight over flow meters is that you will get correct measurements even though you fill a glass with foam. Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT Does it work with cider, soda and other drinks? Of course! Just set the final gravity to the liquid’s density in the app to get a correct conversion from weight to volume. If you don’t know it exactly, 1.010g/cm3 is a good guess for beer and cider. Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT I already have a Plaato Airlock. Will I need to download another app? Nope, same app. Just set up the Plaato Keg and you will see both your Airlock and Keg in the app. Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT Does it handle cold temperatures? Yes, it is built for kegerators and can handle temperatures down to -10°C (14°F). Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT Can I clean it? Yes! Clean the device with a damp cloth. Don’t put it in your dishwasher. Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT What countries do you ship to? Pretty much world-wide: Australia, Austria, Argentina, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Canary, Islands, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Jersey, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT How big kegs can I use? Maximum 50L (13 gal) kegs. The total weight capacity is 60kg (132 lbs). Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT Will it fit my keg? Kegs come in many shapes and sizes, so we tried to build the Plaato Keg to fit most of them. See the dimensions to be 100% sure. Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT How can you know volumes by measuring weight? Luckily, brewers tend to know the density (gravity) of their beer and converting to volume is straight forward. If you have not entered a final gravity for the beer in the app, we will use a default value of 1.010 g/cm3. If you are using the device to measure amounts of water while brewing, simply change the FG input to 1.000 g/cm3 or choose to display the direct weight measurements. Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT I am a developer. Can I integrate Plaato to my own app? Yes! Integration will be possible and will be similar to the Plaato Airlock. You can check the docs here. Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT I have more than one keg, will I need a Plaato Keg for each one? If you want to monitor them at the same time you should get one for each. Also, you can use one for your CO2-tank! We have good discounts if you want more than one. Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT Will it work on my home WiFi network? Yes. Any regular home wifi network with a 2.4GHz band. Enterprise networks or networks with a login portal will not work. Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT What units are you using? The app lets you choose between metric units or American units. Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT Does it measure the temperature in my kegerator? We have included a temperature sensor inside the device to monitor the device’s temperature and it will be available in the app with current and historical data. The device will be slightly warmer than its surroundings due to heat from the WiFi chip, but you can use it as an indication to what your kegerator temperature is. Keep in mind that temperatures inside a fridge varies greatly depending on where you measure, so you have to consider where the device is placed. Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT Will you have integrations to other brewing apps? We believe that your data should be accessible to you. We therefore support integrations so that you can route the data to your favorite brewing app or your own server. Third-party brewing apps can make their own integrations so that you get data from Plaato in your favorite brewing app. Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT How is the WiFi reception inside my fridge? Pretty good! We are using the 2.4GHz WiFi band, which is better at penetrating walls than 5GHz networks. If your router is not too far away from your kegerator you will have a good connection. Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT How does it work? The Plaato Keg has three weight cells that measures the total weight of your keg. Data is transmitted to the cloud through your home WiFi network and is displayed in the Plaato app. The weight can be tared from the app, and you can set the weight of the empty keg. If you enter the gravity of your beer in the app, you can also see how much beer you have in liters or gallons. Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT Can I use it to weigh ingredients during brewing? Of course! It can be hard to get the correct volumes of water etc during brewing and The Plaato Keg turned out to be a handy tool while brewing. We use the Final Gravity that you put in the app to convert from weight to volume. Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT Can I use this as a scale for something completely different? Yes! It may say “beer left” in the app, but other than that you can use it for whatever you want. One in our team used a Plaato Keg prototype for mixing concrete when renovating his apartment. It turned out pretty shitty, but that’s just what happens when programmers try to do something practical. Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT I have more questions. Can I contact you? Of course! Write us here on Kickstarter so others also can read the answer as well. We also use our Facebook account where you can chat directly with us. If you happen to be in Norway, let us know and stop by our office in the center of Oslo! Maybe you have a great idea for another product for brewers? Tue, Jun 4 2019 12:07 pm EDT ?  ""]"

Kitty love comes free, but they do have real needs. Housing, food, supervisory care in the cattery adds up. We will charge a fee to cover our costs.  All adoption fees go to the rescues they come from. Sun, Apr 12 2015 5:20 am EDT Can I visit if I don't want to adopt? Absolutely!  That's the idea.  Many of us can't have cats for whatever reason.  We just want you to come hang out, and be here with us.  Sometimes being around humans and being social is all a lonely animal needs....including kitties! Thu, Feb 19 2015 12:48 pm EST Can I bring my cat? Sorry.  This place will only be a place for rescued kitties who have no real home, and looking for one.  Trust us though, your cat wants you to leave him at home so he can catch up on all the shows you can't agree on:) Sun, Apr 12 2015 10:45 pm EDT Can I eat and drink alongside the kitties? At this point kitties will be indoors, and food and trucks out back on an awesome patio.  We will work to marry the two so that you can eat and drink with kitty. Sun, Apr 12 2015 5:20 am EDT Why are you going vegan? Some people are really upset we are going vegan.  Why is that?  Veganism isn't meant to exclude anyone, and we promise we won't push it on you.  Our goal is just to be yummy or your money back...while hurting no animals in the process.  We believe this place is built on love and respect for animals, and we are making as compassionate of decisions as we can for them. Sat, Apr 11 2015 4:27 am EDT Is this place non-profit? No.  Kickstarter does not allow charity projects. Crowdfunding is for building cool dreams and ideas through small donations when other options are limited.  We will foster kitties, and adoption fees will go throught the rescues we represent at the time of fostering.  Blue Cat Cafe is an LLC. Sun, Apr 12 2015 5:17 am EDT What do we do if we hit $60K?

Each batch yield will vary a little (depending on the nuts, seeds or veg you use) but in general you'll make about 1-1.5 cups of cheese which for me generally translates to three small wheels or two larger ones.

The Internet of things (IoT) is the inter-networking of physical devices, vehicles (also referred to as ""connected devices"" and ""smart devices""), buildings, and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity which enable these objects to collect and exchange data. The IoT allows objects to be sensed or controlled remotely across existing network infrastructure,creating opportunities for more direct integration of the physical world into computer-based systems, and resulting in improved efficiency, accuracy and economic benefit in addition to reduced human intervention.

Virtual reality (VR) is a computer technology that uses Virtual reality headsets, sometimes in combination with physical spaces or multi-projected environments, to generate realistic images, sounds and other sensations that simulate a user\'s physical presence in a virtual or imaginary environment. A person using virtual reality equipment is able to ""look around"" the artificial world, and with high quality VR move about in it and interact with virtual features or items.

From that point on the actual history of the division starts. This volume will cover that history from 1984 to 1993. From sharing one small room with three people to a studio that employs a few hundred artists, setting up and owning four overseas studios, this volume covers the development and production of the following series and the special projects in-between: Further more, there will be a chapter on the creation of the Movietoons label and their first production DuckTales the Movie - Treasure of the Lost Lamp (1990) and other discarded Movietoons projects. The final chapter covers the projects that the studio started developing, but that never went beyond pre-production. These chapters will contain never before seen artwork and show descriptions. Some being developed to just the show pitch, while others went on to the scripting phase of production and stopped there. The goal of the book is not only to talk about the series themselves, but also about the people who developed, wrote, designed, story boarded, timed, recorded and animated these productions into shows we all know and love.

We\'ve even heard from people that they plan to acquire an iPad just to get this collection! However, due to the massive interest in the back catalogue, we are looking in to other options. We are taking all of your thoughts and suggestions seriously, and are currently looking into cross-platform compatible distribution.

The majority of the funds raised, however, will go directly to the costs it takes to bring these archives into a new format. New Scribbler bears all of the expenses of developing the app as well as all costs of the crowdfunding effort. Fri, Jul 19 2013 2:07 pm EDT What is OCR? Optical Character Recognition is defined by Wikipedia as the mechanical or electronic conversion of scanned images of handwritten, typewritten or printed text into machine-encoded text.

273,3273,"[' Somebody over on reddit asked me how I was intending to ‘fix’ adoptees, and said that they would be offended if they were sold music for someone ‘broken’. Here is my answer... Hello :) Thanks for commenting, fair question. I’m definitely not claiming that I’m going to write music that’s going to fix anything, and I don’t think that adoptees are broken, but I do think many of them will have missed out on early life experiences. I’m not sure whether this would apply to you, not knowing your situation or where you are from, but children in the UK are almost all adopted from the care system and have been removed from biological parents for various reasons. My son for example was often left alone as a baby (among other things), so he missed out on loads of early communication experiences that other babies would have had. Infant-directed speech is pretty well documented in developmental psychology and there’s plenty of research in to early communication and development. I’m basing my project on the work of Colwyn Trevarthen and Stephen Malloch, if you want to look it up. Malloch coined the term ‘communicative musicality’ to refer to the musical features of infant-directed speech, and multiple studies have shown these to be consistent across different cultures - so to my mind they must serve a purpose for supporting early brain development, be it forming building blocks for social interactions, communications, bonding with parents, or whatever. As my son missed out on a lot of this sort of thing, I’d quite like to see whether I can give him some of these experiences now, to help ‘fill in’ the developmental gaps, as it were. (This is the current thinking in the UK adoption system, to try and parent in a therapeutic way.) However my son is nearly nine and even though developmentally he’s a lot younger it’s not really appropriate to do baby talk with him all the time - hence why I had the idea of taking the musical features of infant-directed speech to see whether I could incorporate them in to new music that was suitable for a child of his age. I don’t really know what’s going to happen, but I think it’s an experiment worth doing, and maybe it will lead on to something more or a proper research project. I just thought that if a child is adopted at 4 or 5, having had not the best start to life, that this might be one way of helping the parents and child to bond, and hopefully helping that child get some of the benefits of the early communication experiences that most babies will have. I don’t know whether that will happen, to be honest, but figure it’s worth a try. At the very least there will be an album of lovely music for families to enjoy together, and that’s no bad thing in itself :) Thu, Aug 9 2018 6:56 am EDT ?  ']"

It’s easy to support Where Excuses Go to Die via Kickstarter, and if you have an Amazon.com account you’re already halfway there. And don’t worry if you don’t; we’ll walk you through every step: 1. First off, please know that your pledge will remain a pledge until August 11 when this campaign ends – and even then, you won’t be charged anything unless we meet our $7,000 goal in time. If our project isn't successfully funded, which would make us sad, no one will pay anything. You can also change or cancel your pledge any time before the end of this project. 2. Once you’ve decided how much you’d like to donate and which reward you’d like to receive, click on the box containing that reward amount and description (in the right hand sidebar). 3. You’ll first be prompted to confirm your pledge amount and reward. If everything looks right, click “Continue to Next Step.” 4. You’ll be taken to a screen that lets you login if you have an existing Kickstarter account OR lets you set up a new Kickstarter account (you also have a third option to login with Facebook). We recommend filling out the form under the heading “New to Kickstarter?” in the middle column (you’ll be asked to input your name, email, and a password). Then click the green button that reads, “Sign me up.” 5. Now you’re the proud owner of a Kickstarter account – but you’re not finished yet! You’ll next be taken to a page that reads, “Check out with Amazon.” Here again you can verify your pledge amount and reward; if all looks good please click the green button that says, “Continue to Amazon.” Don’t worry if you don’t have an Amazon account: you’ll be given a chance to create one in order to make your pledge. 6. The next page you see contains both Kickstarter and Amazon logos. This is where, if you HAVE an existing Amazon account, you can simply put in your email address and your Amazon password. Remember that your Amazon password is probably different from the password you just created for Kickstarter – and be sure that if Amazon prepopulated an email address for you it’s the correct one. If you can’t remember whether or not you have an Amazon account or if you’re sure you DON’T have an Amazon account, please input your correct email address, select the radio button that says, “I am a new customer” and then press “Sign in using our secure server.” [PLEASE NOTE: Amazon has a much better memory than most people we know. If you’ve ever bought anything on Amazon, you probably have an Amazon account that you’ve forgotten about. But fear not – Amazon will tell you this! If the email address you enter for them is already on file, they will give you the opportunity to have a password reminder sent to that email address. You can then follow those directions to log directly into your existing Amazon account and continue with your Kickstarter pledge (see step 8, below.] 7. Just like Kickstarter did, Amazon will prompt new users to provide a name, email address, and password. If it makes your life easier, you CAN use the same name and password you provided to Kickstarter. 8. Next, Amazon will take you to a series of pages asking you to input your billing information (a valid credit card is required here). Remember that you’re not actually being charged at this time, but Amazon will securely keep your account on file. (Feel free to look up their stellar security record.) 9. Hit submit, and Congratulations! You’ll be taken to a page that fully confirms your Kickstarter pledge and acknowledges you as an official backer of Where Excuses Go to Die. You can choose to share your pledge with others via social media or simply close out of the window. You’re done and we thank you for taking the steps needed to make your pledge.

There are a total of about 150 photographs in the two books.  Most of them are 3 by 3 inch prints that I scanned at 300 dpi and are printed as 6 by 6 inch photographs in the two volumes.  I did this so you can see the detail in these photos.  I used Photoshop to clean up the photos but in many cases there are still scratches.  These are NOT fine photography books. To my knowledge these photographs have never been published before.  They were all taken in the 1942 to 1945 time period and I have had possession of them for about 40 years.

When that process is complete I will look at the nominations made in the ""Comments"" section of this campaign and come up with the rest of the schools that will receive sets of books.  These will mostly be in the United States because of the cost of postage.  I will try and balance geography and small colleges versus large universities.

We do the work of finding them for you, so all you have to do is pull up the app and enjoy! Furthermore, MicroFinder is much more than just a map. You can also search our database of craft spirits, check out ratings and rate them yourself, and save everything in My Bar. And we're just getting started! Become a backer and see what other amazing features are yet to come in MicroFinder! Wed, Nov 28 2018 1:59 pm EST ?  ""]"

401,3401,"[' What is the difference between Brioche and DK Brioche? Double-knitted brioche is worked in one pass, using the two colours together, and working every single stitch, as opposed to trad brioche, where you only use one colour at a time, and have to work two passes for every single row. DK brioche creates a fabric that differs from trad brioche quite significantly. This is because as they create the stitches and the yarnovers, the two yarns interact with each other in a very different way. Not only is the fabric more condensed in terms of row gauge, but when I\'ve shown the two side by side, many people have exclaimed at how much neater they think the DK brioche fabric is. That, however, as far as I am concerned is something that pales into insignificance next to the fact that DK brioche can be ONE HUNDRED PER CENT REVERSIBLE, in a way that trad brioche just can\'t achieve. As a double-knitter, that\'s my holy grail, and can only be accomplished with DK brioche. Sat, Oct 12 2019 11:21 am EDT Is DK brioche the same as One-Pass brioche? No, it\'s not. One-pass brioche, as the name suggests, is a method of creating the traditional brioche fabric without having to work two passes for every row. It\'s a perfectly possible and viable way of working trad brioche, and there will be a whole section of the eBook devoted to it. What it is NOT, however, is the same as DK brioche, which has a completely different structure, and can be 100% reversible, in a way that trad brioche cannot. Sat, Oct 12 2019 11:27 am EDT When will the eBook be ready? I don\'t want to stick a hard and fast date on this at the moment, as it depends on a great many factors, but I am hoping it will be ready sometime in May or June, 2020. Sat, Oct 12 2019 11:27 am EDT Who is publishing the eBook? I am planning to do as much of the work as I can myself. There are some aspects of book publishing that require skills that I don\'t yet have, but I\'m very confident that they are things that I will be perfectly capable of picking up between now and when I need to implement them! Sat, Oct 12 2019 11:27 am EDT Who is this eBook aimed at? This eBook is aimed at anyone at all with a keen interest in furthering their knowledge of what is possible in knitting. It\'s not for absolute beginners, you\'ll definitely need to know the basics of knitting to get the best out of this book, but if you\'ve ever looked at brioche before, and said to yourself, ""I\'d like to have a go at that, but it looks really hard,"" then this might just be what you are looking for. I genuinely believe that DK brioche is much easier to learn than trad brioche. Sat, Oct 12 2019 11:41 am EDT ?  ']"
