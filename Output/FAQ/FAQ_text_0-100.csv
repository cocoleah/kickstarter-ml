15,15,"["" Who, or What is Razroo? Razroo is a software consulting company(https://www.linkedin.com/company/razroo) based out of NYC. It was started by Charlie Greenman(https://linkedin.com/in/charliegreenman/). Right now the firm isn't too large, and employs about 4-5 part timers. Collectively, we have experience working for Fortune 500 companies, such as Goldman Sachs, Verizon, and Merrill Corporation. We have one product on the way, as well as one book. Both of which will be complete by December 2020. We are trying to establish a very strong open source presence within the community, and this Kickstarter helps contribute to that cause.

20,20,"[' What file formats can I export from Block Modeller? We currently support exporting FBX and STL.  FBX is a general purpose file format used in many Graphics packages.  STL is used primarly for 3D printing. Tue, Feb 14 2017 5:09 am EST How does it work? You are given a 3D workspace, a cursor, and a palette.  You can move the cursor within the 3D workspace.  To place a block you move the cursor where you want it, and press space.  Press delete to remove.  The palette lets you pick what shape, color and texture you want to put down. Tue, Feb 14 2017 5:17 am EST How does it compare with existing 3D Modellers? The main problem is converting an idea in your head into a visual 3D representation.  The tools vary from low cost applications like Blender, to high end systems like 3D Studio, Maya, and others.  All of them require a fair amount of skill to use.  Block Modeller is low cost, and easy to use.  Playing with toy bricks easy. Tue, Feb 14 2017 5:20 am EST ?  ']"

The print-head assembly was specifically designed to keep the spindle cool to protect your bearings; typically under 50 degree C during printing (just warm to the touch, not hot at all). Your spindle gets much hotter when you are using it for milling. Tue, Sep 15 2015 2:32 pm EDT Will using my CNC for printing wear out my lead screws? With care, it shouldn't. We've run ours for hundreds of hours with no problems. We even run extremely long print jobs of over 40 hours. Typical print times are in the 20 minutes to 5 hours range.

Android and iOS are a high possibility and I'm hoping I'll be able to look into porting the game to mobile devices when its ready for release. As for consoles, the engine I'm using currently doesn't support console porting so it'll be far into the future if MWDH comes to consoles. Wed, Jul 4 2018 8:51 pm EDT Will the game be available in other languages? The game is being written in English and will be released in English.

MWDH is recommended for audiences of 14+ for swearing in some of the villains dialogue, blood, and violence. There is no sexual content in the game and romance does not go further than kissing.

77,77,"["" How many stories will the book have? Our current plan is for 18 stories of no more than 7,000 words. That's 126,000 words, so the size of a fairly hefty novel. Of that we hope that at least 6 stories will come from Bristol writers and at least 6 from Caribbean writers. As we are having open submissions, we hope the remaining stories will come from all over the world. We haven't specifically promised this in the project description because plans rarely survive contact with reality. We might get sent a really good 10,000 word story, or some great flash fiction. And finance-wise it is always hard to know what you'll be able to afford as different rewards have different costs so you don't know how much money you'll end up with. But it is what we are aiming for, and hopefully we'll get there. Mon, Oct 31 2016 1:06 pm EDT Where will the money go? By far the largest chunk of expenses in the budget is paying the authors. We plan to pay professional rates, which are 6c per word. You can do the math. After that he biggest bill will probably be printing the paper copies of the book, followed by Kickstarter fees. We also need to pay for a cover, and there are various other people who will be working on the book who need to be paid - Roz and Jo, for example. Cheryl does not get any money until the book makes a profit, which isn't going to happen as a result of the crowdfunding alone unless we go well over the base target. Mon, Oct 31 2016 1:20 pm EDT What is the deadline for submissions? Steady on, tiger, we haven't funded yet. Assuming we do fund, we'll have a planning meeting and set out the calendar for the production process. As we said above, we'd like to have the book ready for Worldcon in Helsinki. We'll open submissions once we have that all sorted. Mon, Oct 31 2016 1:20 pm EDT Aren't pirates awful people? Yes, most of them were. Privateers - men like Drake, Grenville and Woodes Rogers in his early career - were pretty nasty too, especially if you happened to be a Spanish treasure galleon. We are not expecting all of the stories to make pirates heroic. On the other hand, if you send us a story about brave pirates fighting against an evil empire we won't reject that out of hand either. Mon, Oct 31 2016 1:20 pm EDT Where did you get that hat? From the Pirate Supply Store in Valencia Street, San Francisco.

We’re not at liberty to discuss this, but I think it has to do with a late-night ouija session and a message from the future :D Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT What platforms is Antstream available on? At launch, the Antstream application will be available on Mac, PC, Xbox One, Android tablet and mobile devices, Nvidia Shield, and Amazon Fire Stick, with other platforms becoming available later, including PS4 and Nintendo Switch. Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT What games do you have on Antstream? Please see https://www.antstream.com/gameslist for our list of currently available games. Remember, these are just the games we have announced, we have many more in the pipeline and are constantly having conversations to expand our game list, so watch this space! Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT Why don't you have game X? I want to play it! Although we have a vast catalogue of licensed games, there will always be a few games that we haven't yet licensed. If there are games you'd particularly like to see on the platform, please let us know in the comments, on Facebook or Twitter, or on our Discord server and we'll see what we can do! Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT Can I add my games to Antstream? If you have the licence to a classic game or a catalogue of titles, we have a pledge amount perfect for you that will allow you to add your games to the platform! Please see the Homebrewer pledge amount for more details. Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT How does Antstream work? Antstream Arcade is an app that gives you instant access to a vast catalogue of games. Once you have our app there is nothing further to download. All the games are streamed directly to your devices including your mobiles, tablets and PC’s of almost any spec. Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT Why ‘stream’ games when you can transfer the entire ROM due to them being so small? As we roll forward to support newer games, the size of the games increase. We wanted to create a consistent experience regardless of whether the game is 48k or 480mb. Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT Are you emulating? Yes. Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT How do you stream it? Antstream technology enables us to run the games in the cloud and stream the display directly to your devices in real-time. It is like using an ultra fast remote PC connection. Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT How do you play games on Antstream? You can play Antstream Arcade on almost any device. All games on Antstream have been custom configured by our retro experts to be playable with keyboard, gamepad and touch screen interfaces. We recommend using a Microsoft Xbox One style gamepad for the best experience. Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT Where is Antstream available? Antstream will be global, but we will initially start rolling out the service in Western Europe and the US.  Please follow us on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter for the latest news on new territories being added to the service. Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT What are Antstream Challenges? We have created exclusive multiplayer challenges for the most popular games on Antstream. These original challenges enable you to compete against your friends and the global Antstream community. For more information please see here - https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/234135283/antstream-retro-gaming-reborn/posts/2482657 Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT What type of internet connection do I need for Antstream? Antstream will work on a very good 4G connection, but WiFi / wired Ethernet provide the best experience.  Due to the unique way this service works, playing games over a mobile network may not currently give the best experience.  Also, as with other streaming services like Netflix, it will use larger amounts of data than some other gaming apps. Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT Will your games be instant loading or will we get the joys of loading screens and music on old systems like the C64? Antstream will be instant loading, but if there is enough demand for it, we will look to add the option for the full loading sequence at a future point, as we do recognise that was an integral part of the original experience, and it'd be a shame to miss out on all those great chip tunes. Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT Do you have any examples of Antstream in action? Our most recent outing can be found at twitch.tv/gamedigital at 11 hours and 15 minutes where we had a retro hour as part of Gameblast 19. We played Double Dragon, Speed Ball 2 and Treasure Island Dizzy. We had a great response and it really shows off some of Antstream’s features, as well as how smooth the streaming is. Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT For those of us whose pledges include a subscription, when will the subscription start from? Will it start from the official launch date in late 2019, or will the subscription start during the beta stage? Your subscription will start when Antstream goes fully live later this year. Consider the early access as a BETA where you get to experience Antstream and feedback to the team without it affecting your subscription. Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT ?  ""]"

98,98,"[' Can I support you and get one of the rewards without pledging on the Kickstarter site? If for whatever reason you are unwilling or unable to pledge on the Kickstarter site, then you can email me at jik@kamens.us and tell me how much you would like to pledge, and then if they campaign succeeds I will arrange payment with you separately and give you the reward corresponding to your pledge amount. However, please think twice before doing this, because such a pledge will not count toward the campaign total on Kickstarter, and I will not be able to proceed with porting my add-ons to Thunderbird 78 unless the campaign on Kickstarter hits its goal. If you would like to pledge via Kickstarter but you are running into technical difficulties, then you can click on ""Help Center"" at the bottom of the page and then ""Contact us"" in the upper right corner to open a support ticket with Kickstarter. Fri, Jan 24 2020 12:36 pm EST Will I have to buy a separate license for each computer or Thunderbird profile I use? Add-on licenses will be per-user, not per-computer or per-profile, so you will be able to use your license on multiple profiles and computers WITHIN REASON. Please be kind and don\'t cheat by sharing licenses among users. Remember that if I am not taking in enough license revenue, then maintaining the add-ons will not be sustainable and I\'ll have to stop, so please play fair. Thu, Jan 23 2020 7:58 pm EST If I\'m a previous donor to your add-ons, do I have to donate again to the Kickstarter to get a discounted license? Previous donors to my add-ons get a separate, special deal! I\'ve emailed most of my previous supporters already, but some have changed email addresses since they donated, and I might have missed a few. If you\'ve donated in the past and didn\'t receive an email from me, and you can give me the means to verify your previous donation (e.g., whether you donated through Paypal or some other way, what email address you used, perhaps you even still have the receipt that Paypal sent you), email me at jik@kamens.us and we\'ll work it out. Having said all that, if it\'s important to you for one or more of my add-ons to remain available past Thunderbird 78, then you should consider pledging to the Kickstarter even if you previously donated, because if the Kickstarter doesn\'t succeed I\'m not going to be able to do the work to port the the add-ons. Note that the previous-donor and Kickstarter deals ""stack,"" so you\'ll still come out ahead. Thu, Jan 23 2020 7:58 pm EST Are your add-ons going to remain open-source? TL;DR I am not sure it will be feasible for the add-ons to remain open-source, but if it is then they will. I have been maintaining add-ons for nearly a decade, and in that time, less than 2% of the people using them have contributed to support them. Given the extent and frequency of recent Thunderbird changes necessitating significant updates to add-ons, that level of financial support is no longer sustainable for me. I tried to solve that, before launching this campaign, by finding volunteers to help with maintaining the add-ons, but none stepped forward. I even offered to give someone all of the contributions received for the add-ons for the next year, and 50% for five years after that, and still, no one was willing to do it. I\'ve therefore reluctantly concluded that the only way I can sustain continuing to maintain the add-ons is if I can guarantee significantly higher recurring revenue than the voluntary contributions. That is why I am using a Kickstarter campaign: the campaign will not succeed unless enough people commit, and it\'s that commitment that I need to be able to continue. If I keep the add-ons open-source after doing the work to port them to Thunderbird 78, then anyone will be able to take the source code, remove the licensing code, and repost them as different add-ons on addons.thunderbird.net, undercutting what I am trying to do here and bringing us back to it being impossible for me to sustain continuing to maintain them. Even now, when this Kickstarter campaign has hundreds of backers and thousands of dollars pledged, if a qualified person stepped forward and volunteered to take over maintenance and port the add-ons to Thunderbird 78, I would cancel the campaign and keep the add-ons free and open source. My goal here isn\'t to rake in cash, it\'s to make it possible for the add-ons to continue to exist, and I have a strong preference for open source when it is viable. But it isn\'t viable if no one is willing and able to keep maintaining the add-ons for free. One caveat: if the Kickstarter campaign succeeds, then I will look into the possibility of making the code open-source under copyright terms which prevents it from being used to compete with the licensed add-ons. I would love to do that if it turns out to be possible. However, I am not sure it will be, because I fear I will end up spending the time and money that was supposed to be spent maintaining the add-ons instead on lawyers suing people violating the copyright.
