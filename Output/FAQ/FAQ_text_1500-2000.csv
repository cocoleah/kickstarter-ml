ミラー監督はどうしてこのドキュメンタリー映画を制作したのですか？なぜトモヤの物語を伝える必要があるのですか？ 「ぼくのこわれないコンパス」を通して、社会から疎外され、声を持たない子どもたちが自身の経験について初めて公の場で話すことができる機会を提供することで、そのような子どもたちを積極的に支援することができます。 今世界中で、子どもたちや10代の若者が立ち上がり、すべての人々にとってより良い世界を実現するために様々な活動をしています。社会に変化を起こし、考えを声高に主張しているのは、今日の若者たちなのです。アメリカでは、フロリダ州パークランドの高等学校で起きた銃乱射事件をきっかけに、事件を目の当たりにした高校生たちが、銃規制改革を呼びかけています。スウェーデンでは、16歳の環境活動家であるグレタ・トゥーンベリが気候変動問題を訴え、世界の注目を集めています。そして香港では、22歳の黄之鋒（ジョシュア・ウォン）が香港のために立ち上がり、香港全体が彼と共に動き出しました。20歳になったトモヤは、日本の児童養護施設における子どもの権利について訴え、今後どのような取り組みが行われるべきかについて、自分の意見を発信したいと思っています。トモヤは、自分から行動に移さない限り、代わりに訴えてくれる人は誰もいないことを十分に理解しているからです。

KEENは、「みらいの森」のスポンサーであり、子どもたちのアウトドア活動や野外教育を推進しています。そしてミラー監督は、ボランティアとして、またアンバサダーとして、「みらいの森」とのつながりを築いてきました。ただし、ドキュメンタリーの撮影過程においては、KEENのスポンサーという立場やマットのアンバサダーという立場は切り離し、高いプロ意識を持って撮影が行われてきました。このドキュメンタリーは、みらいの森を宣伝するための映画ではありません。あくまでも「ぼくのこわれないコンパス」はトモヤの物語であり、彼の成長過程において重要な役割を担った団体として、みらいの森は紹介されてます。

ミラー監督とKEENは、みらいの森の許可を得た上で、活動内容の撮影を行いました。 子どもたちの個人情報を守るため、みらいの森と各児童養護施設で撮影された映像の確認を行うこと以外には、「ぼくのこわれないコンパス」の撮影における同NPO団体の関与はありません。 Sun, Sep 1 2019 10:47 pm EDT

トモヤはいまだに心的外傷後ストレス障害（PTSD）の症状に苦しんでいると言っています。「ぼくのこわれないコンパス」の撮影を通して、トモヤは心の傷を少しでも癒すことができましたか？または、自分の過去をさらけ出すことにより、彼の心の傷はより深いものとなりましたか？ トモヤとの撮影を始める前に、私たちにとって最も重要な課題は、彼が今人生のどの段階にいるのかをよく理解することでした。トモヤが映画の制作チームに安心して自身の経験を打ち明けることができ、公の場で自分の生い立ちについてオープンに話すことができる、強い精神状態にある必要がありました。 私たちが気付かないところでトモヤの精神状態を悪化させたり、まだ向き合う準備ができていない過去の出来事に触れることで、より彼の心を傷つけたりするのは、あってはならないことだったからです。 トモヤは恥ずかしがり屋なところもありますが、自分の生い立ちについては、とても率直に自信を持って話してくれました。 私たちはトモヤの心の状態をこれからも定期的に確認するため、彼との連絡を取り続ける予定です。この映画のメッセージを広める上でトモヤを全面的に支援し、今後必要とされる心のケアやあらゆるサポートを行い続けていきたいと思っています。 Sun, Sep 1 2019 10:47 pm EDT トモヤはどのようにしてこのドキュメンタリー映画に関わるようになったのですか？ マット・ミラー監督は、2つのNPO団体「みらいの森」と「リビングドリームス」との関わりを通して、4～5年前にトモヤと出会いました。「みらいの森」が企画した様々なキャンプやプログラムに、ミラー監督がボランティアとして参加した際に、トモヤもリーダー実習生として参加していました。また同様に、「リビングドリームス」のプログラムでも、ミラー監督はトモヤを見かけるようになりました。 そのうち、高校を卒業して一人暮らしをしていたトモヤは、ミラー監督が制作していたドキュメンタリーに出る可能性について、考えるようになりました。 トモヤは、児童養護施設での自身の経験を話すことは、とても大切なことであると強く感じていました。トモヤにとって児童養護施設はたくさんの良い思い出が詰まった場所であるにも関わらず、メディアは施設の否定的な側面しか映し出していないように彼は感じていました。多くの人が聞いたことのある施設のイメージとは違う、新しい視点をもたらしたいとトモヤは思っていたのです。 Sun, Sep 1 2019 10:47 pm EDT 「ぼくのこわれないコンパス」に出てくる児童養護施設は、どうして施設名が表示されていないのですか？ 児童養護施設の名前や所在地は、インターネット上で公開されています。このドキュメンタリー映画において、特定の施設に焦点を当てる必要性がないため、施設名は明示しないことにしました。また、撮影は複数の施設で行われており、特定の施設が不必要に注目を浴びることのないよう、映画の中では様々な施設で撮られた映像を混ぜて使用しています。 Sun, Sep 1 2019 10:47 pm EDT 「ぼくのこわれないコンパス」の中で子どもたちの顔が映されていないのは、どうしてですか？ 児童養護施設で暮らす子どもたちは、それぞれ異なる事情を持ち、複雑な環境に置かれていて、その状況に対する明確な答えが必ずしもある訳ではありません。 「ぼくのこわれないコンパス」に映っている子どもたちのほとんどが小学生です。彼らが学校でいじめられたり差別的な扱いを受けたりすることのないよう、また、親から身を隠している子どもたちの居場所が特定されないよう、プライバシーを尊重して子どもたちの顔は映していません。 Sun, Sep 1 2019 10:47 pm EDT この「よくある質問」のページに記載されていない内容について聞きたいことがあるのですが、メッセージしても良いですか？ A.  ご質問があれば、遠慮なくいつでもメッセージをお送りください。 Sun, Sep 1 2019 10:47 pm EDT 「エグゼクティブ・プロデューサー」として支援をすると、リワード（出資への見返り）として、どのようなプライベートパーティーに参加することができますか？ 「エグゼクティブ・プロデューサー」レベルでご支援いただける場合は、「ぼくのこわれないコンパス」制作チームの一員としての扱いを受けることができます。またプライベートパーティーに関しては、直接メッセージをいただければ、詳細の情報をお送り差し上げます。 Sun, Sep 1 2019 10:47 pm EDT ヘリコプターツアーの長さは何時間ですか？また、ツアーはどの会社を通して行われますか？

誰が「ぼくのこわれないコンパス」の制作に携わっていますか？ 8月初頭に、ドキュメンタリー制作に携わったメンバーの名前、写真、短い紹介文を公式ウェブサイトに掲載する予定です Sun, Sep 1 2019 10:47 pm EDT Kickstarterは安全なウェブサイトですか？Kickstarterを初めて使用します。 Kickstarterは、安心してご使用いただけます。世界最大規模のクラウドファンディングサイトで、毎年世界中から集まる数十万人もの支援者によって数々のプロジェクトが実現されています。Kickstarterをご利用される際、ユーザーの個人情報は安全に取り扱われます。 Sun, Sep 1 2019 10:47 pm EDT 最終的にプロジェクトの目標金額に満たない場合、私のプレッジ（支援を約束するための寄付金）はどうなりますか？ 目標金額に満たない場合は、寄付いただいた金額を請求されることはありません。 Sun, Sep 1 2019 10:47 pm EDT これまでどこで「ぼくのこわれないコンパス」の撮影は行われてきましたか？ 東京都、神奈川県、千葉県、新潟県、長野県、栃木県、茨城県、宮城県、岩手県、福島県で、撮影が行われてきました。 Sun, Sep 1 2019 10:47 pm EDT When do I get my 100% off coupon to pick any pair of KEEN Footwear I want?

Mon, Oct 1 2018 6:15 pm EDT Why did you release these out of order? Technically, I didn\'t. Originally, this was a 600-page graphic novel but that would be impossible to print. The cost was way too high. I thought it would be cool to break them up. I wanted to start with OII because I thought it would be intriguing to read through this story a bit confused as to what\'s going on. And, over time, start to understand. Plus, there is a part of the story that needed to be separated (OI) from the rest of the story. Something that some may discover.

To photograph something that doesn’t move, such as on land, by day, by holding a smartphone camera up to the eyepiece: Yes.  Nifty little holders for this are advertised online.  Every few months there’s an improved version. To photograph the Moon at night, with that same smartphone holder: Yes. To photograph other celestial objects, but you don’t use or understand an “equatorial mounting” with a “clock drive” to compensate “right ascension”: No.  Celestial objects are so faint that you need a time-exposure to collect enough light.  But Earth’s rotation makes them appear to move in arcs across the sky.  Magnifying the objects with a telescope also magnifies their motion.  While you’re taking the time-exposure, motion blurs the image horribly. To photograph celestial objects, and you use and understand your equatorial mounting and clock drive, and right ascension: Yes.  Attach our “Optical Tube Assembly” model (f/4.2) to your mounting or to a telescope already on that mounting.  Follow all the procedures for astrophotography.  That’s how glorious astronomical images are taken.  Alert: This is very tricky!  Many things can go wrong and ruin most attempts.  Talk it over with experienced astrophotographers.  If you have the skills, patience, attitude, and personality for it, proceed. Sun, Apr 24 2016 5:01 pm EDT Can You Use Other Eyepieces in Bright-Eye? Yes.

However, if you want multiple items, simply add the cost of the extra item to your pledge (please refer to the Add-on topic following). After the campaign finishes, we will send out a survey where you can confirm your extra items. Wed, Feb 26 2020 8:00 pm EST Add-on: How do I add more item(s) to my pledge? 1: If you’ve already pledged to this project, click the “Manage My Pledge” button at the top of the page. If not, click “Back this project” and pick one of the rewards. Every backer can pick one and only one reward level. 2. Look at the Add-On Menu in the project description. Find the item(s) you want to add. Then increase your reward by the corresponding dollar amount. For example, if you choose a reward level of Maco Go ($22), and would like to add an extra  Maco Go ($20) and an extra USB-A adapter ($5). Total pledge = $22 + $20 + $5 = $47 (adjust your pledge from $22 to $47.) The shipping is ONE flat fee of $10~$15 AUD depending on your location - no matter how many items you get. 3. Done, you can sit back and relax. After the project ended, we will send you a survey to ask you for shipping information, which items (if any) you added from the Add-on Menu and also confirm your color selection. You will also have the chance to add any Maco products later on in the survey. Wed, Feb 26 2020 8:00 pm EST Rewards: I want to add a Maco product(e.g. Maco cable organiser) to my pledge, how can I do it? If the Maco product is listed at the Add-on menu in the project description, you can just simply adjust your pledge amount by adding the discounted price of the specific item you would like to add on top of your original reward. If the Maco product is not listed at the Add-on menu in the project description, do not worry. After the campaign ends, we will send every backer a survey where you will be able to add on any additional Maco product(s) you want that is not available on the Add-On Menu. Our other Maco products can be found at hellomaco.com Wed, Feb 26 2020 8:00 pm EST Product: What is the dimension and weight of Maco Go? The dimension of Maco Go is 32 x 42 x 10mm / 1.2 x 1.6 x 0.4inch. The weight is 20g / 0.04lbs. An illustration can be found under the Specifications on the campaign page. Wed, Feb 26 2020 8:00 pm EST Products: Will there be more colours for Maco Go? We’re always open to adding more colours. However, adding other (colour) options does become tricky with our manufacturing (minimum order quantity), and inventory management side of things. We’ll consider introducing more colours as the campaign progresses. Wed, Feb 26 2020 8:00 pm EST What devices are compatible with Maco Go? We also offer an option USB-A adapter which allows you to charge with any device or power adapter with the USB-A adapter. Wed, Feb 26 2020 8:00 pm EST Shipping: When will I receive my reward? We aim to have manufacturing completed in July 2020, and send stock to our fulfillment centers (Melbourne & Hong Kong). We hope to start shipping rewards by the end of July 2020. We will keep all of our backers updated and be completely transparent with progress. Wed, Feb 26 2020 8:00 pm EST Shipping: What shipping method will you be using? Wed, Feb 26 2020 8:00 pm EST Shipping: How much is the shipping fee? Shipping is a standard flat fee of AUD $10 for Australia, and AUD $12-15 for the rest of the world. There is no added shipping fee for any additional item you add to your reward. Wed, Feb 26 2020 8:00 pm EST Return: What is your return / refund policy? Unfortunately, we do not offer refunds or returns on items received as Kickstarter rewards. The items you receive after making a pledge is not a purchase but are referred to as ‘rewards’. The item is more of a gift to you as a sign of our appreciation to you for supporting our campaign and business. If the item/s you received is faulty, we are more than happy to send a replacement item/part, and we do have a two-year warranty on all our products. Wed, Feb 26 2020 8:00 pm EST Warranty: Do you have a warranty for Maco Go? Yes. We have a two-year warranty on all our products. If any product becomes defective, we will replace it free of charge. Wed, Feb 26 2020 8:00 pm EST I have another question? Please message us directly through Kickstarter or via our email: info@hellomaco.com, we’d be more than happy to answer any questions.

Making the best product with minimal intervention and ingredients is what we are working to produce. Our nutritional panel will be finalised and made available prior to production. Tue, Aug 13 2019 6:13 pm EDT Do your beverages contain added sugar? Our beverages include naturally occurring sugars from the fruits but do not contain any added sugars.

Tue, Aug 13 2019 6:13 pm EDT What is our philosophy? We value quality ingredients that are expertly grown and thoughtfully sourced. For us, the tea is always the hero and cold brewing is the way we showcase all the nuanced flavours the leaf has to offer. We love to source local when possible – our black tea is grown in far North Queensland near Wooroonooran National Park, and we flavour our beverages with real fruit – never added sugar. Tue, Aug 13 2019 6:13 pm EDT Why is our product in cans? We’ve also put a lot of time and consideration into our packaging –  a slimline aluminium can – which makes our brews convenient for the consumer, with minimal impact on the planet.

Kickstarter is full of ambitious, innovative, and imaginative ideas that are brought to life through the direct support of others. Everything on Kickstarter must be a project with a clear goal, like making an album, a book, or a work of art. A project will eventually be completed, and something will be produced by it. In our case, we produce activewear from ocean pollution. Wed, Oct 14 2020 12:13 pm EDT What is crowdfunding? Crowdfunding is a way for creators to raise funds to bring ideas to life, typically where a large number of people 'pledge' a small amount of money in return for a reward or gift. Wed, Oct 14 2020 12:15 pm EDT Cancellation policy If for any reason you decide to change your mind on your order during this campaign, you are able to cancel and receive a full refund, no questions asked. Unfortunately we can't accept returns after the rewards have been shipped to you, but \u2028sizing exchanges will be available within 15 days of receiving your reward, provided we have your alternative size in stock. You'll only have to cover the costs of the return shipping and we'll take care of the fees in sending you the correct size. Orders from 'backers' are not real 'purchases' per se, but rather as contributions in exchange for 'rewards’ in return for believing in and funding the project. The support we get from our Kickstarter backers is what enables us to run and grow our business, gather customer feedback, design new products, and improve existing ones. That is why refunds of contributions are not available for our campaign on this platform. Fri, Oct 16 2020 6:24 am EDT How do I tell you my size? That's easy.

When you make a pledge to our campaign you are effectively securing your backing and your card details are taken to do this, but we don't charge you at that time. After the campaign has been successfully funded we'll confirm all of your order requirements in the post-campaign survey and at the point your card will be charged.

Will they lose their position or come off if I bump my tracker? The magnets are actually quite good at holding their position. We did multiple tests to see how well they hold including shaking the tracker vigorously back and forth, tapping it on a table on its edge, and lightly dragging fingers across the magnets. They held position in all tests and are unlikely to come lose from regular use. Tue, Dec 1 2020 11:26 am EST What happens if I lose some of my magnets?

Thu, Dec 10 2015 10:09 am EST Why does printing cost so much? Okay, you now have a better understanding of the costs of attending the Show, and you're wondering why the printing cost is so high. Great question. Letterpressed stationery is called handmade for a reason. Many hands are involved in the process. 1) The Designer - I draw the designs whether by hand or directly on my computer and submit vector files to the printer. 2) The Printer - Once my printer has files in hand (or technically in email), he or she will review the files to make sure everything is formatted properly and then send them off to the die maker. He or she also orders the paper at this time (Paper manufacturing is an entire process unto itself). 3) The Die Maker - Using computer-automated machinery, my design is laser-etched into a piece of copper. 4) The Printer - Once my printer receives the plates, it's time to set up the press. This involves mixing the ink (by hand) to the specified color and making sure the plate is aligned properly on the press. This is called registration. Registration is very important, especially when more than one color is involved, because you want to make sure the images align just right (each color in letterpress and foil stamping requires its own plate and the press must be cleaned every time a color is changed). Once the plate is registered, the color mixed, and the impression set (how hard the plate gets pushed into the paper), the cards are ready to be made. All of that for one card. Multiply that by the number of pieces and then the number of colors. When you receive a letterpressed card is like receiving a mini work of art. Thu, Dec 10 2015 10:32 am EST ?  ""]"

Thu, Mar 7 2019 1:34 am EST What are the specs for the LifeStraw Home and the replacement filters? Thu, Mar 7 2019 1:42 am EST How do I know when to replace my filters Indicators for replacements for the Membrane Microfilter: The membrane microfilter ends its useful life when it becomes clogged and stops passing water through it. The Membrane microfilter is a long term technology and should only need to be replaced once per year.  If after a year the flow rate of the filter is still good, you do not need to replace it until you notice significant slowing of the flow rate.  This filter can never be rendered ineffective, it will only stop filtering. Indicators for replacements for the Activated Carbon and Ion Exchange Filter: In general, concentration of heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury, Cadmium, Chromium, etc. in tap/ground water (excluding sewage, industrial waste water) is only in ppb level (part per billion) and is extremely low compared with concentration of normal minerals such as Potassium, Calcium, Magnesium, etc. in the same source of water which is in ppm level (part per million) Our activated carbon fiber and ion exchange filter is specifically designed to selectively remove heavy metals while keeps healthy minerals in the water through a complex process: physical adsorption resulting from Van der Waals forces and chemical adsorption where chemical bonds are formed to trap heavy metals in the porous and high surface area of the adsorbent material. In theory, this process can reduce TDS in the water but only in µg/L level which cannot be detected by a normal reading when taking into account the deviation of TDS in raw water (e.g city tap water), accuracy/repeatability of TDS meter & measuring operation. In general, we caution against the use of TDS as a measure of efficacy and you can read more about why on our recent blog post: https://www.lifestraw.com/blogs/news/do-you-know-what-s-in-your-tap-water Developing an accurate lifetime indicator has been a common challenge for the industry - certainly one that we acknowledge and will be working to address.

Longform plays like a movie or novel across four plot-driven Acts and three character-driven Intermissions. This follows a more traditional Western story structure with room for quiet scenes, interpersonal moments, and downtime. If you'd like to GM Spindlewheel, Longform is well-suited for a more directed experience. Festival plays like a TV episode or short story. The game takes place over six Events that roll directly from one Event into the next. (e.g., an Invitation into a Challenge into a Duel into an Ultimatum into a Cataclysm into a Vision...) This encourages bold moves, bombast, and mayhem. If you'd like to run Spindlewheel GMless, Festival is a great place to start. Thu, Oct 8 2020 2:29 pm EDT Can I play the game with the SPINSTER tier? Yes! The SPINSTER tier comes with an 8 fold pamphlet that explains the rules of Festival, but the rulebook goes into more depth! Thu, Oct 8 2020 2:29 pm EDT ?  ""]"

Yes because of it\'s health benefits and the customization options. It\'s awesome for any professional that spends many hours in front of the computer and relies on shortcuts or frequent key combinations. Programmers, graphic designers, 3D modelers or gamers are just a few of them. Raise firmware and software are opensource. Check this video Matt (Dygma\'s Tech Lead) did showcasing some stuff that can be done with it\'s firmware https://youtu.be/YkWh_l7_5H0 Fri, Dec 29 2017 10:57 pm EST I\'m not sure what mechanical switch to choose.

Is it possible to pick different switches? During the Kickstarter campaing you can choose between Kailh speed switches (gold, silver, bronze, copper) and regular MX (blue, red, brown). In the future we will have many more brands and types of switches available at a very competitive price. Fri, Dec 29 2017 10:57 pm EST My Keyboard layout is not US-English. Will the Raise support my layout? Most likely. It would depend of how rare your language is. If it\'s reasonable popular language then there will be no problem. We will send 2 keycap sets, the first one PBT US-English and the second would be ABS of your chosen language. In the case that we don\'t have your chosen language layout, we will give you all options we have. Blank keycaps will be one of those options. Sat, Dec 30 2017 7:54 am EST What material will the keycaps be made from? We will send 2 keycap sets, the first one PBT US-English and the second in your case would be ABS of your preferred language. PBT and ABS are different kinds of materials. PBT caps are nicer but quite more expensive to manufacture. We are giving the second keycap set as a gift to all our backers :) Sat, Dec 30 2017 7:54 am EST Does Raise have tenting or tilting? Tenting: Yes it does. Raise will have tenting 100% guaranteed. We haven\'t announced it because we still don\'t have a solution we are happy with. Tilting: No. Raise has a 3º angle from front to back but doesn\'t have tilting legs option. It\'s palm pad is attached to elevate the wrist and reduce strain. Sat, Dec 30 2017 7:54 am EST Is there any extra USB port in Raise? Yes, there\'s a USB slot in the cable. The piece that connects both short cables to the main cable has a USB slot. Sat, Dec 30 2017 7:54 am EST How long is the cable? And the small cables that connect both sides of Raise? Each cable section that connects to the central piece of the cable is 25cm (9.8 inches) long including the connector. You\'ll be able to split both sides close to half a meter (19.6 inches) away. And the total length of the cable will be 2m (6.56 feet) Fri, Dec 29 2017 10:57 pm EST I\'d like to place both sides of the keyboard far apart. Can I buy an extension cable? We know that some people want to split both sides further away so in the future we will create a 1.5m (4.92 feet) longer extension cable. Fri, Dec 29 2017 10:57 pm EST When will we tell you our switch and language preference At the end of the Kickstarter campaign we will contact all backers to ask for their switch and language preferences and other relevant information. Sat, Dec 30 2017 7:54 am EST Are palm rest detachable? And palm pads? Our original idea was to have detachable palm rests. We tested with multiple coders, designers and gamers and they all said that they would only remove the palm rests to transport it. Knowing that our users probably would prefer to use Raise with the palm rests, we decided to not make them detachable to reduce the manufacturing complexity and costs. Palm pads are detachable so they are easier to clean. Fri, Dec 29 2017 10:57 pm EST How tall is the palm rest? The palmrests start at 8mm (0.31in) thick, close to the thumb buttons is 12mm (0.47in) thick and the top part of Raise is 16mm (0.63in) thick. The Palm pads are detachable and are 8mm (0.31in) thick. In the final product this numbers will probably be slightly different because of the different materials and manufacturing techniques. Right now we only have one thickness for palm pads but for the future we want to have a thinner option too, in the area of 3mm (0.12in). Sat, Dec 30 2017 7:54 am EST Why DOESN\'T Raise have a number pad? Not having a physical number pad is a conscious design decision. With Raise\'s configurator software you can create multiple layouts and toggle between them instantly. Also every key in every layout can be remapped and can be a configure as a macro. So you can have the functionality of a full size keyboard in a smaller layout. For example, the first layout could be the standard typing layout and the second one could have F1-12, arrows, number pad and volume and music control. It would require some adaptation period to get used to your number pad new location but on the long run I think you\'ll love it because you won\'t need to move your hands from the home-row to use it. Sat, Dec 30 2017 7:54 am EST Can I disable or lower the intensity of the underglow or backlight with the customization software? Yes. You\'ll be able to individually control every LED and assign colors depending on the layout you are on and the function the key has. Sat, Dec 30 2017 7:54 am EST Do you support ISO and ANSI? Yes, both. Fri, Dec 29 2017 10:57 pm EST Is it possible to sync the RGB lighting with or other brands peripherals? It totally depends on the other brands giving us access so we can sync with them. Our software and firmware are open source, so the other way around it won\'t be an issue. Fri, Dec 29 2017 10:57 pm EST Raise being ergonomic, why isn\'t ortholinear? Over a year ago when we started this proyect, our first design was ortholinear. We made multiple prototypes and sold 50 for a closed beta. We tested for two months and reached the conclusion that the learning curve was too steep. If you are interested in reading about our development process, please check our blog http://www.dygma.com/blog/ Fri, Dec 29 2017 10:57 pm EST Can keys have special behaviors? Yes! A single keys can have special behaviors if you tap once, several times or hold it. For example, you could configure your Shift key so it behaves this way: Fri, Dec 29 2017 11:05 pm EST What are the benefits of a split keyboard? A normal keyboard forces the wrists to bend towards the pinky side of your hand. Rotating the split keyboard halves lets you keep your wrists at a more neutral angle which decreases pressure and strain over time. You can also adjust the total width between the two halves of the keyboard, potentially placing them directly in front of your shoulders and reducing shoulder internal rotation. You can detach any sides and play with the other and you’ll have more space for your mouse and extra thumb buttons. And if you want a normal typing experience you can just snap both sides together. Fri, Dec 29 2017 11:07 pm EST Isn\'t the spacebar key too small? I\'m concerned I\'ll missclick. The majority of people press a small area of the spacebar. Take a look at how you type and game and you’ll know which would be the best spacebar key location for you. If you use a large area or use both thumbs, our software allows you to rebind any key. You’ll be able to rebind as many keys as you need for the spacebar. Fri, Dec 29 2017 11:07 pm EST Are the 4 keys under the spacebar comfortable to use? We’ve called these keys the Under-row. We’ve tested the location of the under-row keys with professional gamers, programmers, designers and more and they loved it. This way you have fast access to more keys in a natural position for your thumbs. Even though the location may seem weird because no other keyboard has them, they are comfortable to use. Sat, Dec 30 2017 7:54 am EST The configuration software and firmware is discussed as open source. Is there a location or project page I can go to today to contribute? The configurator is called Chrysalis, and is hosted here: https://github.com/Lepidopterarium/Chrysalis Sat, Dec 30 2017 11:06 am EST What license will the ""open source"" software and firmware be released under? The firmware is released under the GPL v2 https://github.com/keyboardio/Kaleidoscope/blob/master/LICENSE The configurator is released under GPL v3 https://github.com/Lepidopterarium/Chrysalis/blob/master/COPYING Sat, Dec 30 2017 11:06 am EST How many LEDs are there in the Raise, and how are they all controlled? We’re using RGB LEDS, where each small package contains 3 separated LEDs, one for red, blue and green. Each key has an LED, and then we have 30 pointing down on each side for the underglow. This makes 135 RGBs, for 405 separate LEDs in total. We are still tuning the underglow lighting, so this number may change slightly as we go to manufacture. Controlling that many LEDs uses a lot of pins! A common method to make this easier is to use ‘clever’ LEDs that contain some processing power inside (like the WS2812), this makes it easier to drive long chains of LEDs, but the downside is cost. To keep the cost low we’re using plain RGB LEDs with a special driver that can drive a matrix of up to 75 RGB LEDs. It handles the hard parts like current control and refresh rate so we only need to update what colour we want where over an SPI interface. Sat, Dec 30 2017 11:06 am EST Would the driver be open source for all the major OSes? So that in the future we can have full control over our keyboard It works on all major OS\'s like GNU/Linux, Windows and macOS. It even works on mobile devices though it\'ll disable some LED functions due to power limitations when connected to a mobile device. It doesn\'t require any additional drivers but instead uses the built in generic keyboard drivers from the OS. All the functions such as Macros, Layers etc are handled on-board the keyboard itself with no real interaction from the OS so no extra drivers are required. Unless future OS\'s remove their keyboard drivers its going to continue working. So I guess you could say the drivers for a specific OS is as Open Source as the OS itself. The real key here is the firmware being Open Source. With the firmware and configuration software being GPLv2 and GPLv3+ respectively the Raise will continue to work even with nutty future OS\'s as long as there is a programmer willing to maintain it. The GPL is a strong copyleft license so the the code can\'t be closed. Mon, Jan 1 2018 11:55 am EST ?  ']"

The design is done, however, and I'm trying to put together personal funds to get the Studio to get started on it before the campaign actually ends.

476,1976,"["" I’ve got my own microphone, can I just get the software? For now, you’ll only be able to pledge for the Dubler Studio Kit, which includes the Dubler software (desktop application for Mac and PC) and our Dubler USB Microphone. There are a few reasons we include the microphone in the kit, all centred on guaranteeing the best out of the box experience. That’s not to say you couldn’t try it with your own mic setup if you want. With the right setup and a bit of hand tuning, you may even be able to achieve good results. We aren't in the business of trying to tie people in with locking hardware. So the mic won’t technically be required to make the software operate - but in reality, the software won’t be guaranteed to work well with other hardware. For a guaranteed optimal experience - use the Dubler mic! There are some other added benefits to our mic. Being USB it’s great for convenience or being on the road. You don’t need a separate audio interface to use it. You can also, of course, use the Dubler microphone as a normal microphone too. We are working with a highly respected microphone manufacturer to produce the units. This enables us to choose components that especially suit our use case. For example, our microphone has a built-in double shock housing to reduce any accidentally MIDI triggers resulting from handling noise. Tue, Mar 26 2019 6:17 am EDT Why are you on Kickstarter if people have already been using the kits? We developed 20 pre-launch kits and we assigned them to artists and people that we have been working with throughout development to get their feedback for our further product development. We came to Kickstarter for a variety of reasons. One of them is the community, there are loads of cool music tech projects that come through Kickstarter many of which we have backed in the past - it feels like the natural choice. We’re also looking to build an amazing community of music-makers from the ground up, and we know this is the place to do it. We’re also a small team of 4 people building a totally new product - that takes money whether hardware or software! We’re on track and we’ve almost completed development, but we still need the cash flow to manufacture the microphones and tie up the last few bits. Mon, Mar 11 2019 6:46 pm EDT Can I use Dubler Studio Kit with something other than the voice? Yes, it would definitely be possible to do something interesting! We’re focused on the voice, as it’s our natural tool for audio expression, but actually, there is scope to experiment with all sorts of audio inputs— including other instruments, or clicking, clapping or stamping your feet! Our pre-launch tester Luna Neptune did some of this with her kit— check out the video. In the past, we’ve played around with an acoustic guitar and tried things like using palm muting to control effects on the DAW. Dubler Studio Kit is a tool for creative expression, and its possibilities are limitless! Mon, Mar 11 2019 7:12 pm EDT What if you can’t sing? For all those out there who can't hold a tune - Dubler Studio Kit still has a lot to offer. For one thing, you can restrict the key, to help keep you in tune. And for many use cases, the pitch doesn't matter at all - such as triggering samples or controlling effects. In fact, you could use Dubler Studio Kit to manipulate multiple dimensional filters and effects on a melody simultaneously played on another instrument (a MIDI keyboard for example). Mon, Mar 11 2019 6:46 pm EDT Isn’t this just a tool for people with no musical talent? Dubler Studio Kit is a creative tool for music making. Like any tool, what’s created is up to the artist [simple or complex, amazing or awful]. The advantage of Dubler is that our starting point is the voice. That gives everyone a head start on other MIDI controllers; as the voice is a tool we’re all very practiced at using. That means it’s still intuitive to use for someone with no traditional musical training. Making it quicker and easier to get started making beats, melodies, and compositions. But that’s just the start. The range and depth of sounds even the average voice can make, is incredible. Try manipulating 4 control dimensions on a keyboard, at the same time as playing a melody and simultaneously crafting the envelope of the audio. It would be impossible. But, the voice can capture that level of expression. Ultimately the result is always going to come down to the artist. But as techniques go; composing with the voice has had some pretty good results. It worked for Quincey Jones. Mon, Mar 11 2019 6:46 pm EDT But you can already do this in Ableton. What’s the difference? Then there is the sample triggering and selection. If you select “drums” as the output for Ableton Audio-to-MIDI it will attempt to break up the input into drum rack triggers. But (and I’m sorry Ableton) is really doesn’t do this well. It’s also limited to hi-hat, kick, and snare. With Dubler Studio Kit you can accurately trigger loads of different samples. Our software learns your voice so it will always trigger the right sample  instead of just guessing based on frequency. Oh and with Ableton you have to choose - drums or melody. With Dubler you can do both at the same time. Mon, Mar 11 2019 6:46 pm EDT Isn’t this the same as Melodyne? Melodyne is a cool piece of software but very different from Dubler Studio Kit. Dubler is a virtual MIDI controller. So the software runs on your mac/pc and your DAW just sees Dubler as any other MIDI controller. Melodyne is more about editing and less about live control. Their pitch analysis software is great but they ignore all of the additional qualities and timbre you can put into your voice. Dubler learns your voice enabling you to: Select and trigger samples: E.g. live beatboxing triggering drum samples or clapping/clicking/tapping to trigger whatever you want. This includes velocity control and envelope following. Synth control: live control pitch, velocity, envelope and pitch bend all by singing/humming etc. Effects control: The timbre of your voice (e.g. hmmm vs. laaa vs. ooohh) controls 4 CC dials. Map these to any effects, filters, synth or DAW parameters you like. You can even use this to allow you select between and blend different synths. Mon, Mar 11 2019 6:46 pm EDT Buying MIDI controllers just before releasing MIDI 2.0 is kinda stupid, isn't it? MIDI 2.0 hasn't broken any old functionality, it is backwards compatible. Also, as we are partially a software offering, we can (and will) take advantage of MIDI 2.0 as soon as it's released via updates. It's also unlikely that most DAWs will support it for a couple more years anyway. Mon, Mar 11 2019 7:18 pm EDT Isn’t this just what Mogees does? We think Mogees are really cool! But I’m afraid it’s simply not the same as our technology. With Dubler we use all the timbral qualities of the voice. Trigger samples, control synths and manipulate filters/effects all live, using your voice. It’s not just the note you sing but the way you sing it. With Dubler you can trigger samples, track pitch, apply pitch-bend, affect the envelope, alter velocity all whilst 4 CC values can be simultaneously controlled based on the way you make a sound. Dubler learns your voice enabling you to: Select and trigger samples: E.g. live beatboxing triggering drum samples or clapping/clicking/tapping to trigger whatever you want. This includes velocity control. Synth control: live control pitch, velocity, envelope and pitch bend all by singing/humming etc Effects control: The timbre of your voice (e.g. hmmm vs. laaa vs. ooohh) controls 4 CC dials. Map these to any effects, filters, synth or DAW parameters you like. You can even use this to allow you select between and blend different synths. Wed, Mar 13 2019 6:28 am EDT Isn’t this the same as The Mouth? In short - No. The Mouth is great but very different to Dubler, and a lot more limited. The Mouth is good for post processing— it listens to the input audio and applies some cool effects or controllers a synthesiser based on the audio input. It does track pitch and does some very basic audio analysis - but that's about as far as the similarities go. Dubler is a live controller. Effects, notes and samples are not applied as a post processing manipulation but controlled live based on the timbre of your voice. Dubler is a multi dimensional MIDI controller. Like a MIDI keyboard and an MPC rolled into one, but controlled using the voice. The Mouth is more like a vocoder/autotune plugin, with a few extra bells and whistles. Mon, Mar 11 2019 6:46 pm EDT Isn’t this the same as Imitone? Again - no... Imitone is cool but it is purely pitch to MIDI. Dubler also incorporates pitch control but that is just one of its functions: trigger samples (e.g. through beatboxing), apply pitch bend, perform envelope following, velocity scaling and control 4 CC values simultaneously - all based on the way you make a sound. So with Dubler it’s not just about the pitch of the sound you make, but about the type of sound you make as a whole. Mon, Mar 11 2019 7:22 pm EDT What’s wrong with real musicians - why are you ruining music creation!? If you’ve read this far you hopefully don’t agree with this question, but it is (very occasionally) a point of view some people have. And one, not surprisingly, we disagree with.

Until now, we have been using aluminum foil to protect our chocolate from external contamination. Aluminum takes a lot of energy when it’s produced which is why we have been looking for alternatives that are compatible with our machine that we use to wrap our chocolate as well as food safety regulagtions. NatureFlex is a foil which has been successfully tested and used by other companies. It has the same properties regarding food safety and is as aroma-tight as aluminum.The foil is made from wood cellulose. For the production of one kilogramm of NatureFlex foil, 5,05 kg of CO2 equivalents are emitted. That is half of what is emitted when producing (primary) aluminum. As the foil is made from organic material, it is fully compostable – even in your garden compost. This has been approved by the label „OK compost HOME“. According to this label (and the European standard EN 13 432), 90% of the material needs to be decomposed after six months (182 days).
