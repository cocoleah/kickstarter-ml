19,119,"["" Can I pledge for more than 1 necklace? Thu, Jan 10 2019 3:25 am EST Will the Phoenix Necklace be available in both variants? Thu, Jan 10 2019 3:26 am EST Why is the shipping more expensive than your past kickstarters? Unlike my past Kickstarter campaigns, this campaign includes items of apparel such as the tote bags and socks! These are larger items and require larger packaging. The Royal Mail prices are based on the size and weight of packages, so the shipping costs are more expensive for this Kickstarter to compensate for any rewards that include socks or tote bags! If you choose pins only - don't worry! I will automatically upgrade your shipping to signed for / tracked so that you don't feel as though your shipping costs have been wasted Thu, Jan 10 2019 4:24 am EST Can I upgrade to tracked shipping? Thu, Jan 10 2019 4:24 am EST Why should I upgrade my shipping to tracked? Unfortunately, the Royal Mail can only reimburse costs of tracked or signed for mail. If you leave your package as standard, there is no way for me to keep track of where it is if it gets lost or delayed and I can't claim to reimburse your costs for you (or myself if missing items are replaced!) Thu, Jan 10 2019 4:24 am EST When should I expect my rewards? After funding ends on the 23rd of January, all funds are collected within one week. Funds should then be sent to me by the 6th of February. I will not be able to order the pins from my manufacturer until after the 14th so I expect them to arrive to me mid-March.  I then have to check through all pins and package them up so I anticipate sending everything late March but will keep you updated! Socks and tote bags however are produced in the UK so anyone who only chooses a tote or socks as a reward will receive their items sooner! Thu, Jan 10 2019 4:24 am EST ?  ""]"

21,121,"["" What platforms are supported? Windows, OSX and Linux will all be supported. Ports to further platforms will be considered at a later date, but that is a lower priority for the project. Tue, Nov 15 2016 4:17 pm EST Why are the tiers so expensive? Many kickstarters offer a lot of exciting rewards cheaply, because they don’t really need the money for development - they treat Kickstarter as a cheap marketing platform. We cannot afford that. Underselling, overpromising and offering physical goods are all a liability for many Kickstarters, and we want to be secure and realistic in everything we offer. Tue, Nov 15 2016 4:18 pm EST Why a custom engine? A custom engine involves more initial work to set up than using the likes of Unity, but in the long-term produces a hosts of benefits. It gives us more flexibility to make changes specific to the project, and in particular makes procedural generation techniques much easier to develop. It also makes us less dependent on an engine service that can lose support or change ownership in future. Tue, Nov 15 2016 4:18 pm EST Why a 3D roguelike? Firstly, we want Jupiter Hell to look amazing. Secondly, we think there are a class of gamers out there who have never tried a traditional roguelike, potentially being turned off by basic graphics or intimidating interfaces. The likes of the new X-COM games have shown that with more modern looks you can pull in bigger audiences and get them hooked on more engaging mechanics than most popular games offer. Jupiter Hell could be the game to get a new generation hooked into this awesome and underappreciated genre. Tue, Nov 15 2016 4:18 pm EST Why so much money? This is an ambitious project, especially with the sound and visuals required to make a really mind-blowing game. This money is needed to properly fund dedicated and professional staff to work solidly on Jupiter Hell, whilst also providing contingency to fund us through any potential setbacks. We have seen too many underfunded projects struggle to achieve their overpromised aims - this level of funding will let us avoid that pitfall. Tue, Nov 15 2016 4:18 pm EST Why so little money? Jupiter Hell is relying on a small team, and doesn’t need the millions that AAA games rely on. Having much of our staff concentrated in Eastern Europe also helps keep many costs down. Tue, Nov 15 2016 4:18 pm EST What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow? What do you mean? An African or European swallow? Tue, Nov 15 2016 4:18 pm EST Will there be multiplayer or any online component? The main focus is on a single player experience. There will be online highscores and other meta gameplay elements (weekly seeds, ghost files, etc), but true multiplayer is not planned at this stage. Tue, Nov 15 2016 4:18 pm EST Will there be support for mods? Yes! Mods are awesome and we will fully support the modding community. Tue, Nov 15 2016 4:18 pm EST Is this like Alien Breed / Shadowgrounds? No. (Those games are awesome, mind!) It shared the same top-down perspective, but the gameplay is very different - it's turn-based, tactical, relying on clever decision making rather than twitch shooting. Sun, Nov 20 2016 9:43 am EST ?

78,178,"[' If the P.J. Jacobs documentary has already reached it\'s $2,500 goal, can I still pledge and receive rewards? Absolutely! The $2,500 is only the MINIMUM that must be raised to fund the project through Kickstarter. You can still pledge and receive the rewards until MIDNIGHT June 30th. Sun, Jun 5 2016 1:34 pm EDT ""P.J. Jacobs Working Title"" is a strange name for the documentary. Is that really what you\'re going to call it? No. That\'s just a generic ""placeholder"" for where the title would be in the graphics. Truth is, we really don\'t know what it\'s title will be yet. Why? Because until we complete principal shooting, there is always the possibility that some unknown aspect of the story will be the driving force in the documentary, and will dictate the title. So hang on to your seats: the adventure is just beginning!!! Sun, Jun 5 2016 1:38 pm EDT If you raise more than $2,500, what will you do with the extra money? The Kickstarter goal amount is only a minimum pledge amount for Kickstarter funding.  It will not cover the entire amount of the production since the producers will also use some of their own funds as well. However, what the additional funding does do is help raise the production values used on the film. That means things like being able to pay for  more/better historical film clip rights, or being able to spend more time during the principal shoot and get even better raw footage for the project. Sun, Jun 5 2016 1:46 pm EDT What happens if you don\'t reach the $2,500 goal by June 30? As with all Kickstarter projects, If the project succeeds in reaching its funding goal, all backers\' credit cards are charged when time expires. If the project falls short, no one is charged. Funding on Kickstarter is all-or-nothing. Fri, Jun 17 2016 1:28 pm EDT ?  ']"
