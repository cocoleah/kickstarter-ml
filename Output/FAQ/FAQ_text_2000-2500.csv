What IS different this time around, however, is that Triumviratus will have a brand new cover (pending) designed by brilliant UK artist Ahmed Raafat! You can grab that piece of artwork by backing at the $3 ""Bystander"" tier. Sun, May 3 2020 6:38 am EDT ""Money back guarantee?"" Yes indeed. I\'m absolutely serious about you walking away from this campaign happy with what you\'ve gotten. If you\'re not happy and feel I\'ve wronged you in our transactions, get in touch and if I can\'t solve the problem, I\'ll issue you a full refund. It\'s that simple. Sun, May 3 2020 6:39 am EDT ""I\'m just waiting until payday. I really want to back this campaign!"" That\'s not a question, but you make the cut for sheer enthusiasm. I just want to take this moment to clear up a common misconception among people who may not have used Kickstarter before, because it differs from many common pre-order systems. The main thing I want to clarify is that Kickstarter won\'t take your money straight away when you pledge. Money will only be taken from your card if the campaign reaches its funding target; and will take it on the day the campaign ends (June 13). For absolute clarity: you won\'t need that money in your account now - you need it there on June 13. So if there\'s a particular reward you\'ve got your eye on, it\'s safer to claim it immediately, or risk missing out entirely. Sun, May 3 2020 6:39 am EDT ""Should I wait until this hits the stores instead?"" I don\'t think so. And here\'s why. This version of Triumviratus is longer than the one that will be available from stores. This version includes a nine-page epilogue. Also, this is the only way to snag yourself the other great gear on offer, such as reams of behind-the-scenes content, and a two hour audio commentary for the book! It\'s also cheaper here, and you get the book much more quickly. Sun, May 3 2020 6:39 am EDT ""Hey, I run this service that can help to boost your project\'s visibility/ranking..."" I\'m going to stop you there. Sun, May 3 2020 6:40 am EDT ""I\'d really like to get a copy of the limited edition hardcover! Can we make it happen?"" If you\'re in Australia, you\'re in luck!

If you\'re anywhere else in the world, I\'ve got some bad news: my post office isn\'t accepting overseas parcels at the moment, due to uncertainties caused by the global pandemic and collapse of distribution chains. If that situation eases, I\'ll certainly make the book more widely available. Fri, May 8 2020 8:24 pm EDT ?  ']"

Voici la version française : Design, création et mise en marché d'une marque de vêtements et d'accessoires de style rock/punk/métal/alternatif qui se démarque. Trashcan.rocks est une boutique en ligne de vêtements et accessoires de style rock, punk, trash, gothic et métal. Nous offrons une vaste gamme d'articles pour hommes et femmes tels que chandails, t-shirts, camisoles, souliers, bottes, bijoux et accessoires que les rockers de ce monde adorent! Nous sommes maintenant prêts à élaborer notre propre marque, notre propre brand afin d'offrir à nos clients des produits uniques, spécialement dessinés pour tous les trashers de ce monde en quête d'un look original et bad ass à son maximum. Grâce à ce projet de socio-financement, nous pourrons débuter notre gamme en créant les premiers items suivants: Pour parvenir à un brand original, de qualité et unique, nous devrons procéder et investir dans les étapes suivantes: À notre avis, trop peu de boutiques offrent exclusivement des produits de style trash/rock, surtout au Canada. Les adeptes de look trash doivent magasiner dans de nombreux endroits différents afin de trouver tout ce qui leur plaît à des prix compétitifs. Nous comptons remédier à la situation en proposant, au niveau international, une boutique en ligne offrant une vaste gamme d'articles pour hommes et femmes qui propose des prix abordables, une livraison rapide et gratuite partout à travers le monde, des produits génériques et de marque (l'objet de ce projet) et un style 100% rock pour nos fans.

Voici la version française expliquant les récompenses: Mon, Nov 13 2017 1:25 pm EST Puis-je voir la traduction française des risques et obstacles possibles du projet? Voici la version française concernant les risques liés au projet : Une préparation et une organisation efficace et exemplaire saura réduire au maximum les risques et obstacles associés à notre projet. Toutefois, nous restons conscients que chaque projet d'entreprise comprend son lot de mésaventures et de défis. En voici quelques-un pour lesquels nous sommes prêts et déterminés à surmonter. Retard dans la production des designs et dessins: nous comptons sur 3 artistes professionnels pour nous aider dans la création des articles. Ces derniers se sont formellement engagés à respecter les délais établis et à nous informer de tout retard ou problème potentiel. Nous avons également un artiste ''de secours'' qui serait prêt à prendre la relève en cas de besoin. Difficulté à trouver les manufacturiers adéquats: nous savons que la recherche de manufacturiers ne sera pas de tout repos. Nous voulons des produits de qualité, répondant à nos critères, pouvant être produits et livrés rapidement, sans surprises ni problème, offrant une disponibilité, un service à la clientèle et un service après vente exemplaires. Nous ne compterons pas les heures à investir afin de dénicher la perle rare et tiendrons nos contributeurs informés de chaque entente établie et problématique rencontrée. Retard dans la réception des items commandés: nous avons prévu une période tampon d'environ une semaine à chaque étape de notre projet. Nous comptons sur les manufacturiers que nous aurons trouvé pour respecter les délais convenus, par contre nous sommes prêts et avons envisagé un retard possible. Encore une fois, nos contributeurs seront informés à chaque étape du processus. Nous désirons faire preuve de transparence et d'honnêteté envers les gens qui nous soutiennent. Budget : des dépassements de coûts peuvent arriver à chaque étape de notre projet. Nous croyons cependant avoir établi des projections réalistes, basées sur des recherches diligentes et bien préparées. Nous avons plusieurs plans de contingences établis afin de résoudre tout dépassement de coûts qui pourrait survenir. Ultimement, même si le projet échoue (ce qui ne risque pas d'arriver mais cela reste toujours une possibilité) nous sommes déjà en mesure de respecter nos promesses envers nos contributeurs puisque notre boutique est déjà en ligne et bien établie. Les gens ayant déboursé afin de soutenir notre projet de branding pourront quand même recevoir leurs articles, peu importe que la collection unique soit une réussite ou non. Mon, Nov 13 2017 1:25 pm EST Puis-je avoir la traduction française de votre profil personnel? Voici la version française de la section ''About Caroline'' : Native de la région de l'Outaouais, au Québec, Caroline est travailleuse autonome depuis plus de 10 ans dans le domaine de la rédaction, de la révision et de la correction de textes, en plus d’être répartitrice médicale d’urgence, auteure publiée, propriétaire d’une entreprise web d’échanges de propriétés et d’une boutique de vêtements et accessoires en ligne. Passionnée de musique rock, punk et métal, d'art contemporain et de mode alternative, elle a longtemps mis ces intérêts de côté pour se concentrer sur une carrière ''plus sérieuse''. Arrivée à la mi-trentaine, elle désire maintenant plus que tout exploiter sa vraie identité, sa nature profonde et sa personnalité quelque peu rebelle afin de mettre à profit ses passions pour la musique et la mode trash dans une boutique en ligne et à pignon sur rue où son expérience entrepreneuriale lui permettra d'assurer le succès de sa marque et de mettre en marché le brand auquel elle compte donner vie. ''Toute ma vie j'ai développé des entreprises et j'ai travaillé dans des cadres formels, guindés, où l'image corporative prend toute la place. J'ai porté des tailleurs accompagnés du typique attaché-case et je devais constamment projeter une image de femme d'affaires sérieuse, professionnelle et conforme aux stéréotypes qui viennent avec ce genre d'environnement. J'ai travaillé dans le domaine immobilier, où l'argent mène le monde, où les gens se comparent de par le niveau luxe de leur voiture et de par le nombre de gros clients que contient leur carnet d’adresses. Toute ma vie j'ai donc mis en veilleuse ce que j'étais vraiment, j'ai dissimulé ma vraie personnalité afin de plaire aux patrons, aux clients et aux partenaires d'affaires. Il me fallait jouer de mon talent de caméléon et afficher mon plus beau sourire durant des 5 à 7 et cocktails interminables où tous et chacun tente de s'approprier de nouveaux contrats et de pousser leur gamme de services à qui veut bien l'entendre.'' ''Il m'a fallu une petite crise de la trentaine pour enfin comprendre que ce monde stérile, froid et rigide ne me convenait plus et qu'il ne m'avait en fait jamais convenu. J'ai choisi de me choisir et d'en faire mon gagne-pain. J'ai choisi de combiner mon goût pour l'entrepreneuriat, pour la musique rock, pour l'art et la mode trash et d'en créer une carrière. Avec Trashcan.rocks, ma boutique en ligne, je peux recommencer à porter mes jeans déchirés, mes bracelets à rivets, mes manteaux de cuir et mon vernis à ongle noir sans crainte d'être jugée ou regardée de haut. Je peux maintenant travailler dans une ambiance rock, rester qui je suis, pour desservir des gens comme moi, qui n'ont pas peur d’afficher leur marginalité, d’exploiter leur personnalité rebelle et anti-conformiste au jour le jour. J’ai préféré être jugée pour qui je suis plutôt qu’être acceptée pour ce que je ne suis pas. Je désire, grâce à Trashcan.rocks, offrir aux gens des vêtements, chaussures et accessoires à mon image, qui sauront plaire aux rockers de ce monde. C’est la carrière, le projet et le mode de vie que j’aurais dû choisir depuis longtemps. Mais il parfois difficile d’user de son fond anarchiste pour assumer ses désirs profonds lorsque ces derniers entrent en conflit avec l’establishment et le cadre social attendu et la pression qu’il engendre. Maintenant que c’est fait, je sais que Trashcan.rocks sera un succès puisque 100% de mon cœur, de mon expérience, de mes connaissances et de mon temps y sont investis. Une entreprise menée par la passion ne peut qu’offrir un résultat intéressant et positif, c'est ma philosophie!'' Mon, Nov 13 2017 1:25 pm EST ?  ""]"

As much as I like and supported the Vita, which I'll always be grateful for introducing me to console development, Brok is a much more technical demanding game. Before switching to GameMaker Studio 2 (which doesn't have support for Vita export) I attempted to run it on the devkit and it's clear this would have required a lot of performance tweaks - while Brok runs near-perfect on the Switch devkit already. With a release date planned for early 2022 on consoles this is too late for the Vita. Tue, Jan 5 2021 1:51 pm EST Why no physical copies on consoles? Tue, Jan 5 2021 1:51 pm EST What about mobile (iOS, Android)? Demetrios did not sell very well on mobile. This is a difficult market where only free-to-play monetization seems to do well, and adventure games cannot work with it - such change would corrupt the core gameplay. Brok will probably end up on mobile someday, but this is a low priority. Tue, Jan 5 2021 1:51 pm EST Why isn't the prologue available on Mac/Linux? Tue, Jan 5 2021 1:51 pm EST Will you be one of those devs ditching the Steam version for Epic exclusivity? NEVER. The only way my games would come out on the Epic Game Store would be non-exclusive.

We will perform ""Siá Kará"" as part of “Habana Vieja: Ciudad en Movimiento” (“Old Havana: City in Movement”, April 6th-10th), an international festival which brings together artists of all disciplines to share projects, workshops, and classes inspired by the history, architecture, and urban design of one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Over its 20-year history, the festival has hosted hundreds of dance companies from over 20 different countries. We are thrilled and honored to be the first American company to participate. Mon, Feb 29 2016 6:19 pm EST How do you expect the company and the work to be received in Cuba? Art is one of the most meaningful layers of cross-cultural communication and international exchange. Further, site-specific dance is a great equalizer, requiring no training, experience or education for participation. Heidi Duckler Dance Theatre will continue its policy of open rehearsals while in Cuba and hopes to bring a new form of, or take on, site-specific art for the people of Havana. We hope Havanans will engage with us during the choreography process and the performance. We love taking questions from on-lookers, discussing the work, learning their personal stories and hopefully providing them with the opportunity to see their familiar places in entirely unexpected ways. Mon, Feb 29 2016 6:19 pm EST Who from the company will be participating in the creation of this project? Heidi Duckler – Artistic Director HEIDI DUCKLER is the Artistic Director and founder of Heidi Duckler Dance Theatre.

She earned a BS in Dance from the University of Oregon and an MA in Choreography from UCLA, and is currently a Board Member of the University of Oregon’s School of Music and Dance Advancement Council. Duckler was recognized with an American Masterpieces Award from the National Endowment for the Arts to tour Heidi Duckler Dance Theatre’s signature work “Laundromatinee,” and was awarded two Dance/USA Engaging Dance Audiences grants. She has most recently been honored with the Los Angeles Women’s Theatre Festival’s Maverick Award, and LA Weekly’s Best Site-Specific Dance Company Los Angeles and was featured as a TedxUCLA speaker in 2015.

The reason for this is that we intend to include NSFW (18+) content in the game, and most consoles will not allow that kind of content.

We stand by this credo: researched and inspired by history, the characters, world and situations in FLAMES OF FREEDOM are a work of fiction. This game was designed, developed and produced by a multicultural team of diverse identities, beliefs and orientation. We took measures early in our process to prioritize Black, femme, Indigenous and marginalized freelancers to lead development in their respective areas. This includes numerous cultural consultants from the Indigenous nations we represent, accessibility readers to make FLAMES OF FREEDOM a great user experience, perspectives on sex positivity and how we treat trauma with maturity (and not as a throwaway \'sanity\' mechanic). We have given all of our freelancers carte blanche to speak critically and openly about their experiences with FLAMES OF FREEDOM, if they choose to do so. We\'ll be featuring some of our developers in coming interviews throughout the Kickstarter. Watch this space.

After collecting these fees, our fulfillment partner SkuTouch will pay the taxes and file paperwork for you. This will ensure a seamless, zero frustration shipping scenario for worldwide backers.

Sun, Oct 18 2020 5:24 am EDT Some of the Dice Towers seem to not have Dice stoppers or a wall. Is it correct? Most of them have a wall that seems too short. The height of the wall is relevant to the total height of the tower. The total height of the wall should be at about 2cm, taking in consideration the standard diameter of a D20 is 2.5cm. We made sure the walls will be high enough even if you decide to print the Tower in the minimum dimensions so that the Dice Towers work properly.

I imagine kickstarter doesn't accept paypal because the chances of someone being unhappy with a project that isn't fulfilling fast enough could file for a chargeback and then things get very messy. The only alternatives I can think of is borrow the credit card of someone you trust, or get one of those prepaid credit cards in a convenience store... sorry! Thu, Sep 19 2019 3:18 am EDT What are your plans once we reach the goal? If we reach the goal, the first thing we'll do is finish up the files we need to send to the printer (almost there!) and organize invoices to be efficient in our fulfillment. while we wait on the money to get to us. Once it does, we'll be sending our order to the book printer and get started on the rewards- most of which Caroline is going to handle and print herself at her job, making sure everything's all good. Afterwards it's just a matter of back and forth with the book printer until we have a book that looks up to our standards and ship everything! Digital rewards should be done around the time we send our files to the book printer, after all edits and preparations are done. Once everything has been fulfilled to all backers, we hope to drop the books in bookstores since part of our budget includes ISBN numbers (and barcodes)! Thu, Sep 19 2019 3:18 am EDT What happens if we don't reach the goal? If we don't reach the goal on this kickstarter no one gets charged, first of all. Which means that we get none of the funds to make this happen. The most likely scenario is that we're still going to get the book done anyway, but by saving money via sales on our stores, personal commissions and whatever else we can spare. This is understandably going to be taking much longer, and we're not going to try another kickstarter again even for a different project- at least not for the foreseeable future! Thu, Sep 19 2019 3:18 am EDT Why is international shipping so expensive? This is sadly the amount it costs us to ship the book out internationally. We spent an entire day trying to find a cheaper cost, but there isn't! In fact it's actually 22$ but we rounded it down to make it a bit less awful; this is sadly a very big and heavy book! To compensate we've made all paper rewards practically free in all tiers with books, so hopefully it's worth your consideration. If you're interested in the book at all, you should get it now since the shipping costs won't change even if we end up putting it for sale later online- and it won't come with any of the extra goodies either! Thu, Sep 19 2019 3:18 am EDT I'm confused about the bookplate- what is it and how do I add it to my pledge? You know how some books you open and they have a “this book belongs to ___” area inside the cover? That's a bookplate! The ones we offer are stickers, so you can stick them wherever you feel like, but we'll make sure there's a designated suggested place for it! It's also the area where I sign your book, if that's something you'd like. To add it to your pledge, just take your current amount and add 10$- so if you have Road to Adventure and ship to America it would be like this: 25$, plus 10$ shipping, plus the bookplate makes 45$. After the campaign ends, if it's successful, everyone will receive a survey to fill out information such as shipping address and what the extra amount they added to their pledge is supposed to be for, so we'll sort it out then!

Electronic music blending hard-hitting and heavy instrumentation with a variety of vocal styles, the lyrical content and general message behind Trap music is motivation to hustle, usually with the implication that the hustle is in pursuit of money. Love Trap hones in on a different topic of hustle- that to “trap hate and spread love” to as great a degree as possible. I created this music in order to encourage people to stay strong and peace-making even though it may seem sometimes as if the whole world around us is filled with hate and negativity. Even though it seems impossible sometimes, we should always run ourselves as if we are each an individual Trap, which stockpiles hate and doesn’t let it go, while putting out the product of love.

188,2188,"[' Can I use my own receiver and transmitter with the Pathfinder Package? Yes, there is space in Sprite to install your own receiver.  The Pathfinder Package was intended for people who either didn\'t want to use a conventional radio transmitter with Sprite or for people who want to install their own equipment. If your receiver uses PPM or S.Bus or is a Spektrum Satellite receiver, you\'re good to go. If instead your receiver outputs all the individual PWM channels you\'ll need an encoder, they are approximately $20 and you can get them through the 3DR website. The space available is approximately 2.0"" x 1.25"" x 0.75"" so most standard radio receivers will fit.  If FPV equipment is not installed there will be additional room if you have a larger than average receiver. Some additional info on compatible receivers is available here: http://copter.ardupilot.com/wiki/common-pixhawk-and-px4-compatible-rc-transmitter-and-receiver-systems/ Mon, May 25 2015 7:47 am EDT Does Sprite support a live video stream? The HD camera included in either Sprite package supports a live video stream, however a video transmitter and antenna are required to broadcast the video to a monitor on the ground.  The transmitter and antenna are not included with Sprite, but space is available to install your own.  UPDATE: First person view (FPV) reward options are now available! Sun, May 31 2015 9:02 am EDT Does Sprite support iOS devices? We\'ve been watching a lot of drone projects here on Kickstarter over the last year or two, and a lot of them have faced delivery challenges that have stemmed from efforts to include many different layers of new technology at the same time. To avoid that trap and significantly decrease the technical risks of bringing Sprite to market, we very carefully have decided to use as many proven, commercially available components as possible. The flight controller and autopilot is one of them. We settled on the most current APM system available, which has evolved over several years and earned its place among the most reliable and powerful platforms. It is trusted by thousands of pilots around the world, and has amassed tens of thousands of flight hours on countless missions. Sprite supports all of the features it provides, including waypoint navigation and all of the other autonomous flight modes, and the only development that has been necessary has been to get the stabilization logic to work with Sprite. As you can see, that\'s been done, and there are only a few final elements that need to be optimized. Unfortunately, along with all of the benefits come a few limitations, and currently that includes lack of iOS support. APM is an open source platform, however, and when (and if) an iOS version of the mission software is available, Sprite will work with it. In the meantime, we iOS devotees still have a few options. First, Sprite can be programmed for autonomous flight using a laptop. Admittedly, that\'s not the most convenient for backcountry operations. You can also fly Sprite with autonomous modes stored in memory, or using a conventional RC transmitter. Otherwise, fortunately there are a wide variety of relatively inexpensive Android devices available that not only serve as a ground station, but also a USB-enabled device that\'s a great place to store all of the amazing photos and video you\'re going to take with Sprite. Thanks again for your interest and support, and we hope to see you among our backers! Wed, May 20 2015 8:06 am EDT Does Sprite Come with a HD Camera? Yes, both Sprite packages come with a HD camera.  The dual-axis mount announced in our first Update is intended to replace the originally developed single-axis mount. Wed, May 20 2015 11:33 am EDT What is the average life of the battery? The flight endurance of Sprite will depend largely on the conditions it is operating in and the mass of the payload it is carrying.  One of our pressing development goals is to optimize Sprite\'s propulsion systems which includes the blade geometry, gear ratios and motor/battery sizing.  This optimization will significantly increase the efficiency adding several minutes to the flight time.  That being said, our current flight time is around 12 min Wed, May 20 2015 12:02 pm EDT How fast can Sprite travel, and what kind of wind conditions can it operate in? Like any aircraft, Sprite\'s ability to hold a stationary position in a headwind would depend on it\'s maximum forward airspeed. We\'ll be doing a full battery of performance validation later this summer, but based on what we\'ve seen with the prototypes, we\'d estimate that to be around 10-12 m/s. That\'s about 25 mph...a pretty good breeze! Mon, May 25 2015 8:13 am EDT I\'m interested in becoming a Sprite distributor.  What can I do? We\'ve received dozens and dozens of inquiries about distribution opportunities, and we\'d like to say how much we appreciate the interest!  We have not decided on a distribution strategy yet, but when we do we\'ll be posting information on our website.  In the meantime, feel free to send an e-mail to info@ascentaerosystems.com and put the word ""Distribution"" in the subject line.  Thanks again! Wed, May 27 2015 8:23 am EDT I see you just introduced the Payload Developers Kit (PDK).  How much weight will Sprite be able to carry? The maximum payload weight will depend on a number of design factors, and not all of them have been finalized. Environmental conditions (density altitude) will also impact performance. Like any aircraft, Sprite will be able to lift more at sea level on a cooler day than at higher elevations in warm temperatures. Much depends on the final motor selections, gearing ratios, and blade geometry. As part of the beta program this later summer, we’ll be collecting data from all corners of the world. We will have beta testers in the southern hemisphere for whom it will be winter, so we’ll be able to get cold weather data as well. Ultimately we’ll be publishing a weight that ensures the ability to hover out of ground effect at a number of temperatures and altitudes. For now, please visit our website www.ascentaerosystems.com/sprite for available specifications. Sun, May 31 2015 9:02 am EDT What are the regulations around first person view (FPV) technology? The regulations around first person view (FPV) vary by country, so please be sure to check your local laws. Some countries limit the frequencies and/or the output power of the video transmitter.  For more information you can start with your country\'s radio control modeling enthusiasts communities, where lots of information is likely to be available. If you are still unsure, we would suggest that you choose the Sprite reward package that does not include the FPV equipment. Sprite\'s design will make it easy to add your own components later.

The comic contains mature themes (accidental violence, sexually suggestive depictions, graphic illustrations of anatomy, etc.) and is intended for adults only (18 and over). The stretch goal rewards contain nudity, too. Tue, Apr 14 2020 8:38 pm EDT How long is the comic? The main comic is 32 pages long, with additional pages of bonus content being unlocked as stretch goals are met. The book will also include an alternate cover, character sketches, pinups and (if unlocked) bonus mini comics. All in all the final book will have anywhere from 60 to 100+ pages of content. Tue, Apr 14 2020 8:41 pm EDT When will backers receive the comic? Backers of the project will receive the digital book by July (hopefully sooner) and physical softcover book shortly thereafter. Tue, Apr 14 2020 8:41 pm EDT I\'m already a member of Giantess Fan. Will AWA: Impact Zone be released on your website for members? Yes, we will release a digital version of AWA: Impact Zone on Giantess Fan. However, this version will not include the bonus content (stretch goal pinups and NSFW mini comics) that are exclusive for backers of the Kickstarter project. We will upload AWA: Impact Zone to Giantess Fan a couple months after all of our backers receive the comic (so potentially early fall 2020).

We are offering printed and digital advance copies of AWA 16 for pledges of the ""macro"" tiers and up. If you choose one of these tier levels you\'ll receive the digital version of AWA 16 by the end of May. The printed version will arrive with AWA: Impact Zone and other rewards as soon as we can print and ship them (by July). Tue, Apr 14 2020 8:43 pm EDT Are the characters from the original A Weekend Alone in this comic? No, this comic contains a cast of entirely new characters. However, the bonus content (pinups, wallpaper, mini comics, etc.) will feature characters (such as Valerie, Mary-Jean, and Sarah) in ways never seen before (naked, barefoot, in special outfits, and more). Tue, Apr 14 2020 8:43 pm EDT The art of AWA: Impact Zone looks a bit different from the original series. Is the artist the same? This project is a collaboration between different talented artists. AWA: Impact Zone has the same line artist (Jiuen) but paired with another colorist (Ylenia Di Napoli). This collaboration helped us create this project without creating any major delays in the production of the main AWA series. The stretch goal rewards feature art from numerous other artists with different styles. We think it\'s awesome to see different takes on the original characters of the series! Tue, Apr 14 2020 8:43 pm EDT Why is the printed book so big? The comic features depictions of tiny people in vast scenes. The subtle details of the scene will be lost if printed on a tiny page. An 8.5"" x 11"" page is large enough to fully enjoy the artwork and fit on a shelf or storage box. Tue, Apr 14 2020 8:43 pm EDT Are you offering a hardcover version? No, not at this moment. If this project is successful, we may consider offering a hardcover version as a reward for a future crowdfunding campaign. Tue, Apr 14 2020 8:43 pm EDT Are you offering add-on rewards (e.g. can I get a printed version of some other comic as a reward)? We are not offering add-on rewards. Kickstarter\'s system does not make it easy to offer add-ons in a simple manner. Tue, Apr 14 2020 8:43 pm EDT Will you ship the book to international backers? Yes but you will be responsible for any import duties or fees incurred. We also urge you to make sure adult comic books are legal in your locality  -- don\'t assume they are!

247,2247,"["" WHAT IS THIS PROJECT FOR? The Cleveland Flea is building furniture — tables, benches, bar, stools and other furniture — to [almost] accommodate the 20,000-30,000 shoppers at our monthly event in Tyler Village. We're reaching out to our community to help us raise the funds for the project. It's the first phase of our goal to #BuildTheFlea a real home in Cleveland. Wed, Apr 22 2015 9:41 am EDT WHY WILL THE PROJECT COST $40,000? We weren't surprised when plenty of people asked why a furniture project costs $40,000. The easy answer: we're serving 20,000-30,000 people each month with the furniture. That's less than $2/person, just at our next event. The real answer: you get what you pay for. Working with local designer 2nd Shift Design Studio to custom-craft furniture to our specific needs and then commissioning a Cleveland woodshop (hello, Soulcraft!) to manufacture the collection costs more than buying in bulk from, say, Ikea. Oh, does it feel better, too! Investing in our local economy hits at the very core of the Cleveland Flea. That's why we started. It's why we exist. It stays true to our mission to continue building the Flea with Cleveland's power, talent and support. Wed, Apr 22 2015 9:41 am EDT WOULDN'T IT JUST BE MORE COST EFFECTIVE TO GO TO IKEA? Cost effective? Well, maybe. In the short term. But you get what you pay for. We'd like to make a solid investment in quality, custom-crafted furniture that meets our service and functionality needs. We don't want to buy furniture to serve 20,000-30,000 people each month, only to need to replace it several times each year. More importantly, we believe in our local economy and Cleveland’s talented small-business community. Supporting and growing our local economy is at the core of everything the Cleveland Flea does and stands for. Wed, Apr 22 2015 9:41 am EDT WHAT FUNCTIONALITY DOES THIS CUSTOM FURNITURE HAVE? Optimized for fast assembly on Cleveland Flea mornings (and quick break-down on Flea nights), the furniture is also made to stack-and-store, taking up just a few feet of our storage unit. And let's just say, there are not a lot of feet to spare. We love it when form meets function. Functionality is key in this project. Partnering with local design shop 2nd Shift Design Studio has made meeting that need possible. Want to see how quick and easy these pieces are to build?

Ask it! You can either post it in the COMMENTS on our Kickstarter page or email hello@theclevelandflea.com. Wed, Apr 22 2015 9:41 am EDT HOW CAN I GET STATUS UPDATES ON THE CAMPAIGN AND PROJECT? Stay tuned to our Kickstarter page. We'll post updates throughout the campaign. If we reach our funding goal, we'll continue to post project updates on the Kickstarter page. Backers will receive updates via email too. We'll continue to tell our #BuildTheFlea story through our Facebook, Twitter and blog too! Wed, Apr 22 2015 9:41 am EDT I ALREADY GAVE TO THE CAMPAIGN.

I like it’s high durability and impact resistance. ABS also has excellent high and low temperature tolerance. The band is made using Cordura fabric. Wed, Jul 15 2020 11:54 pm EDT How many lumens does WIK have? WIK is an ambient light so it’s lumen output is a little difficult to quantify. I measured about 60 lumens at the source. One of my favorite features of WIK is that it will stay at that output for the entire use of the battery. No dimming. Wed, Jul 15 2020 11:54 pm EDT How many charge cycles will WIK’s battery support? WIK uses a lithium ion battery which typically gets anywhere from 300-500 charge cycles. We have taken steps to protect the battery by lowering the charge rate and not letting the battery’s voltage get to low before shutting off. We think this will give WIK a higher than average number of charge cycles. Wed, Jul 15 2020 11:54 pm EDT Does WIK come in a smaller size? Yes. A regular size and a smaller size. Regular will fist most people comfortably. I recommend the smaller size for Kids. A survey will go out to all the backers with the information needed to select size and color.

It will explore the abstract realm of biomechanical art, including many instructional feature articles by a variety of artists, a photo gallery of tattoo work by our long list of contributing artists, a biomechanical painting gallery, and a massive section of fully realized biomechanical art done in collaboration by dozens of artists through a private online gallery, exploring every nook and cranny of this genre from the robotic to the geometric to the organic to the alien mutant, and everything in between. Thu, Dec 14 2017 4:01 pm EST What is the biomechanical style? Imagine the mechanics of biology; the way that living things grow, move and evolve. Picture also the textures and details of not only the organic biological world but the industrial one as well, and then imagine the different ways these elements could be mixed, fused and contrasted against each other. This gives you an idea of the abstract art realm that we are exploring in The Biomech Encyclopedia. This genre was popularized by the great Swiss artist H.R. Giger when he designed the creature and sets for the original Ridley Scott film Alien. Since then it has become popular with tattoo artists, fantasy artists, filmmakers, creature designers, game programmers and many other drivers of our modern culture. Thu, Dec 14 2017 4:01 pm EST When will the Biomech Encyclopedia be available? The layout and design work for The Biomech Encyclopedia is well under way, with plans to send it off to the printer around the end of February.

The Biomech Encyclopedia is being published by Proton Press, run by veteran tattoo artists Guy Aitchison and Michele Wortman. Proton Press has been a mainstay in the tattoo community for fifteen years, with titles such as Guy Aitchison\'s Organica and Reinventing The Tattoo, Michele\'s Moments Of Epiphany, Nick Baxter\'s Sharp Focus Realism in Oil, and the tattoo community group projects Innerstate and Scratch Art. You can find many of these books at www.hyperspacestudios.com or at Guy\'s educational site, www.tattooeducation.com. Thu, Dec 14 2017 4:01 pm EST Who is Guy Aitchison? Guy Aitchison began tattooing in 1988, gaining international recognition through a series of magazine articles early in his career. In 1992 he held his first educational seminar and began publishing small educational volumes along with the seminars. Since then he has been involved in the educational end of tattooing, producing a variety of videos and books including his flagship educational product, Reinventing The Tattoo, which can be found at www.reinventingthetattoo.com.

307,2307,"["" I don’t work out very often. Will Quell be too difficult for me? Worry not. Quell’s difficulty can be tailored to each user via adjustments to both the game and the Gauntlet. Like most games, you can set the difficulty level of Quell and adjust this as you progress. The Gauntlet is fully adjustable comes with a range of resistance bands that let you tune the force and resistance profile to your personal requirements. This means you can start at the level that’s right for you and take it from there! Fri, Aug 28 2020 12:59 pm EDT Is Quell safe? Yes! We’ve designed the Gauntlet to be totally safe for all our users. Quell provides regular guidance and feedback on your form via our high-accuracy motion tracking. Additionally, unlike traditional shadowboxing, the Gauntlet prevents hyperextension when throwing straight strikes and thereby prevents this type of injury as well. Fri, Aug 28 2020 12:59 pm EDT I don’t have any boxing experience. Can I still play Quell? Quell can be enjoyed by anyone, regardless of prior boxing experience! We'll be including lots of tutorials on proper technique, and our motion tracking enables us to provide players guidance on their form. This has been carefully designed to teach our players the foundations of proper boxing technique and prevent any injuries. Fri, Aug 28 2020 12:57 pm EDT Do I need anything else to get started with Quell? No—you only need the Gauntlet and your laptop, phone or tablet to play, so you’ll always be ready for a session. Fri, Aug 28 2020 12:58 pm EDT What platforms is Quell launching on? We’re launching on PC, Mac and mobile devices. We’re also actively pursuing other platforms like VR and consoles that we want to support after our initial launch. Fri, Aug 28 2020 12:58 pm EDT Do I need to set up a camera or other device to play? Nope! All motion tracking is achieved using sensors in the Gauntlet, so all you have to do is slip it on, connect to the game and get started. It’s that simple. Fri, Aug 28 2020 12:58 pm EDT What if I just want to have a quick workout without playing through the story? Good news! Quell has several modes beyond the main story, including customisable training sessions that let you jump straight into the action whenever the feeling strikes you. Fri, Aug 28 2020 12:58 pm EDT What about sweat/is the Gauntlet washable? The Gauntlet can (and should!) be washed, either by hand or in the washing machine—using a gentle cycle will ensure that it stays fresh and in good condition for your next session. Fri, Aug 28 2020 12:58 pm EDT How much space do I need to play Quell? If you have room to throw a punch, you can play Quell. We designed Quell to have the minimum possible space requirements so that people could enjoy a fun, exciting workout whatever their setup. Fri, Aug 28 2020 12:58 pm EDT Will the Gauntlet be available in different sizes? Yes! Better yet, the Gauntlet is designed to be highly adjustable, meaning that our sizes work for a broad range of body types. This means that we can accommodate upper waist measurements from 23'' to 50'' (that’s 58 cm to 127 cm for the metric folk). Mon, Aug 31 2020 9:06 am EDT What is Quell+? Quell+ offers our players the definitive Quell experience, providing access to all the new workouts, new quests and new enemies we release as we continue to support Quell. It also provides access to our online services, including online multiplayer and seasonal leaderboards with awesome rewards. For people buying Quell post-Kickstarter, Quell+ will require a small subscription fee to fund our online platform and continued content development. As a special thanks to our Kickstarter backers for supporting Quell from the beginning, we’re including access to Quell+ totally free. The earlier you back, the more free Quell+ you get. It’s our way of giving back to the Kickstarter community. Fri, Aug 28 2020 12:58 pm EDT How much will Quell+ cost? Although we haven't settled on an exact price yet, we can say with certainty that it won't cost more than you're typical Netflix/Spotify subscription. Fri, Sep 18 2020 7:30 am EDT Can multiple users play with the same Gauntlet and account? They certainly can! You can start multiple saves with the same account on Quell, and use the same Gauntlet as these are not tied to the account. Each user will require a Quell+ account to gain access to our ongoing content releases. Mon, Aug 31 2020 9:06 am EDT Can I purchase multiple copies of the Early Bird reward tier? You can. When you purchase the reward, if you increase your pledge to include the additional Early Bird then we'll send you two Full Quell Systems, each including 6 month's access to Quell+. Tue, Sep 1 2020 1:04 pm EDT Can I connect Quell to my TV or another external display? You can connect by HDMI from your PC, laptop or (via an adapter) from your mobile device. Alternatively, you can use a Chromecast or Miracast-based device to cast/mirror your screen and connect wirelessly. Tue, Sep 8 2020 2:12 pm EDT ?  ""]"

You will be sent a survey at the end of the Kickstarter campaign. In this survey you will enter your shipping details as well as pillow options (i.e. Pillow Shape or Size). Mon, May 8 2017 11:52 pm EDT Does the light disturb my sleeping partner in the morning? Mon, May 8 2017 11:52 pm EDT Does it come with a Pillowcase? Yes. You will receive one free premium ultra soft diamond-quilted pillowcase. It is made of high quality Tencel fabric that is ultra-breathable, removable and washable. Mon, May 8 2017 11:52 pm EDT Is the pillow height adjustable? The ergonomic contour model Sunrise Pillow is designed with dual heights. A lower side and a high side for small and large persons. If one side is too low, simply rotate the pillow to use the high side and vice versa. Mon, May 8 2017 11:52 pm EDT How accurate is it? The sleep tracking sensors in your Sunrise Smart Pillow are the most accurate on the market; especially due to their position. Other sleep trackers are placed on your nightstand or under your mattress. The sensors and microphone in the Sunrise Pillow are embedded deep beneath layers of premium memory foam. This allows the Sunrise Smart Pillow to accurately detect your sleep cycles (via movements and sound) with an extremely higher rate of accuracy. Mon, May 8 2017 11:52 pm EDT What powers the Sunrise Smart Pillow? Your Sunrise Smart Pillow is battery powered and uses a standard Micro-USB charger. Mon, May 8 2017 11:52 pm EDT How can I wash it? The soft premium diamond-quilted Tencel pillowcase is removable and washable. You can spot wash memory foam with baking soda or use a light soap and water application--all of the components of the Sunrise Smart Pillow are waterproof. This is best washing practices for all premium memory foam pillows. Mon, May 8 2017 11:52 pm EDT If I choose to disable Bluetooth while I sleep, how will my Sunrise Pillow know to wake me? Your Sunrise Pillow saves your alarm times & settings. Similar to your native iOS or Android device, simply set your alarm for multiple days of the week (e.g. Mon thru Fri @ 6:30am & Sat. Sun. @ 10am) and your selections are automatically synced to your Sunrise Pillow (you must be paired to do this). Mon, May 8 2017 11:52 pm EDT If I choose to disable Bluetooth while I sleep, does this affect my sleep tracking? No. Your sleep data is stored in your smart pillow. The next time you pair with your Sunrise Pillow, your sleep data is automatically synced to your iOS or Android device. If you leave Bluetooth on at all times, your Sunrise Pillow works seamlessly by automatically syncing your sleep data to your iOS or Android device. Mon, May 8 2017 11:52 pm EDT How long does the battery last? The battery of your Sunrise Smart Pillow lasts up to 21 days without a charge. Mon, May 8 2017 11:52 pm EDT Can I control left lights and right lights individually to avoid disturbing my partner when reading or waking? Yes! Absolutely. Your Sunrise Smart Pillow gives you the ability to select which lights (left side, right side, or both) you want to use for individual functions. Mon, May 8 2017 11:52 pm EDT Can I feel the lights on top or beneath the surface of the pillow? The Sunrise Smart Pillow's most prominent feature is specifically designed to be invisible (or hidden) beneath layers of memory foam. You cannot feel the components, or lights, even when laying near the edge. Mon, May 8 2017 11:52 pm EDT Can I replace parts if I wish? Unfortunately, no. Maintenance of your Sunrise Pillow would require technical expertise that is just not common enough for everyone to enjoy. Thus we will not be offering any self-upgrades or additional parts. Rest assured, your Sunrise Smart Pillow will last beyond 5+ years (both comfortably & technically) without any maintenance or issues. Mon, May 8 2017 11:52 pm EDT Can I charge my phone (by plugging it in) to my Sunrise Smart Pillow? That depends. If this project exceeds a specific Stretch Goal Amount, the answer is Yes! If you like this feature, you can help this option become a reality by clicking any or all of the share buttons (facebook, twitter, reddit, pinterest) and sharing the project often. Mon, May 8 2017 11:52 pm EDT Can I get an additional pillowcase? Yes. You will be able to purchase additional pillow cases in the final survey (when the campaign has ended). Mon, May 8 2017 11:52 pm EDT Will there be tracking or delivery confirmation? There will be tracking and delivery confirmation on each shipment, to your door. Mon, May 8 2017 11:52 pm EDT What are the dimensions of the Sunrise Smart Pillow? Fri, May 12 2017 2:13 pm EDT What shipping method will you use? Shipping varies depending on location. You will receive your package via DHL, USPS, and FEDEX, and more. Mon, May 8 2017 11:52 pm EDT How comfortable is the pillow? Your Sunrise Smart Pillow is ultra comfy. We designed it with only the highest quality premium memory foam. It is rated Medium to Medium-firm. Mon, May 8 2017 11:52 pm EDT Will it be possible to bend the pillow in half for double thickness? Yes! Sunrise Smart Pillow is bendable, durable, even dropable. Mon, May 8 2017 11:52 pm EDT When will the app be released for download? September 2017 Tue, May 9 2017 10:29 am EDT Why does the Early Bird price keep allowing for more early birds? Our team has opened up this $99 price tier for everyone (on Kickstarter).

This survey is based on the amount you pledged and will ask you what pins/add ons you want. Sun, Jun 16 2019 1:31 pm EDT What is the difference between Classic and Pastel pins? Classic vs Pastel: typically the classic version of a pin has brighter colors and a black nickel finish (black lines), while the pastel versions have alternative colors (usually more pastel/light, sometimes they have alt hair colors), and they typically deploy a complementary metal finish (gold line art). Sun, Jun 16 2019 1:35 pm EDT I pledged for x pins as an early bird but I want more, what should I do? Go to the main kickstarter page, and you\'ll see a ""manage pledge"" button on the top right. Click that to increase your tier if you need to.  If the next slot of early birds is taken up, send me a message and I will open another slot for you -- after all, you should get to keep your early bird pricing! Sun, Jun 16 2019 1:35 pm EDT Say I get more than one pin, and I want some classic, and some in pastel -- is it possible? Yes! You can mix and match color options. There will be choices for this on the surveys that come out after the campaign. :) Sun, Jun 16 2019 1:35 pm EDT How do I get add-ons?

342,2342,"["" Hey, what about the motorcycle parking? The parklet is replacing a car space, and the motorcycle parking is turning into bicycle parking, roughly. We (DNA) actually petitioned to get those 6 metered motorcycle spaces installed, way back when. But then in the intervening decade, the Cycle Gear motorcycle shop moved in right across the street from us, and they installed eighteen *free* motorcycle spaces on Harrison at 11th. They're literally 50 feet away. Once the parklet is installed, if it turns out that the difference between 18 and 24 motorcycle spots on the same block is actually significant, we'll start the process of turning another car space into metered motorcycle parking. We'll see! Many members of our staff ride motorcycles, so we'll know right away. Trying to roll this change into the parklet permitting process at the beginning likely would have delayed the whole project by another year. The bureaucracy is even more horrible than you can imagine. Wed, Jul 31 2013 2:13 pm EDT What about smoking? It's illegal to smoke with 15' of the entrance of a business, and the parklet is within that distance of the restaurant, so there will be no smoking in the parklet. And yes, we will be enforcing this. Wed, Jul 31 2013 2:13 pm EDT Can I drink a beer outside? Sorry, no. The parklet is not a part of the restaurant, it's technically a public park. And it's illegal to drink in public parks (ha ha, right). But more importantly, you'd get us in trouble for it, so no booze in the parklet. Wed, Jul 31 2013 2:13 pm EDT But I can eat there, right? Absolutely! You can sit out there and enjoy the day with your food and non-alcoholic beverages, whether purchased from DNA Pizza or from somewhere else. The parklet will be available to everybody.

The Coven deck is extremely limited, only a few remain, but send me a message to find out more :) Sun, May 15 2016 3:29 am EDT Why are there limited rewards when they look the same? When I original launched the campaign I neglected to remove the shipping cost for US backers as advertised in the reward description. The only way for me to correct this was to duplicate the rewards and lock down the incorrect ones. If you are a US backer in this reward you would have got a message from me to change over to get the free US shipping. If you are outside of the US and are in one of these limited rewards you don’t need to do anything as it is the same as the other reward. I’ve contacted Kickstarter to see if there is anything else they can do but their answer was NO!

Tue, Jun 30 2020 10:19 am EDT How long does Rflow ventilation system work? Can I use eBreath mask without the air ventilation system? Rflow can be used during 4 hours before you need to charge it via USB in 30 mn. You can use your mask without Rflow, the valve contains a silver ion filter that filter the exhaled air. Tue, Jun 30 2020 3:32 pm EDT Are the filters interchangeable ? How long can we use the filter for? Filters are interchangeable and they come 5 in a pack (5 x N99 filters & 5 silver ion filters for the valve). We recommend changing the filter after 100 hours of usage, depending on pollution in the area you live and your activities. Sat, Jul 11 2020 4:21 pm EDT Is the mask washable? The eBreath mask is easy to clean by hand or in a dishwasher and the overlay can be cleaned by hand or in the washing machine for easy maintenance. Tue, Jun 30 2020 3:48 pm EDT What does eBreath Mask filter? Does it protect against viruses? eBreath mask provides excellent protection via  filters that remove >99% of contaminants of a similar size to the novel coronavirus. However, the mask cannot eliminate the breathing in of all particles and cannot eliminate the possibility of becoming sick. Sat, Jul 11 2020 4:17 pm EDT What is Rflow? How it works? Rflow extracts the warm air you exhale through the silver ion filter in the valve.  The silver ion filter cleans and purifies the air. It is also very efficient at eliminating the bacteria and impeding growth of microbes like spores, fungi and viruses - it destroys bacteria cell’s inside configuration and absorbs cell’s elements in order to make sure that the bacteria cells will not harm the air around it. Sat, Jul 11 2020 4:17 pm EDT How do I buy extra filters? Once you've become a backer, we'll send you a survey during the campaign where you can chose your mask colour and size. At this point, you can also chose whether to add more replacement filters. Filters will cost €19 for 5 x N99 filters / 5 x silver ion filters for the valve   (RRP €23).

If you\'re not interested in watching the video, here it is in a nutshell: go to the green ""Manage Your Pledge"" button at the top right of this page, and click it. You can then add any dollar amount you like to your existing pledge and devote that to whatever items you find on our Add On sheet, which have corresponding amounts next to them. Once the campaign is over, we\'ll send all our Backers a survey for them to fill out and tell us exactly what items they want us to send. Done! Wed, May 6 2015 5:03 pm EDT How do I tell you what items I pledged for? Once the campaign ends, we\'ll send out surveys to our Backers through Backerkit, a fulfillment company we\'ve used for each of our campaigns. With the survey, you\'ll be able to select each reward item you\'d like your pledge money spent on, and even add funds if you want to purchase more. Sun, May 10 2015 7:28 pm EDT Hey, you\'ve got more than one deck unlocked and I\'ve pledged for more than one deck. Can I spread my multiple deck order over the different decks? Absolutely! At the end of the campaign, each unlocked deck will be available for our Backers. If you\'ve pledged for one, you\'ll be able to use your Backerkit survey to choose which deck you\'d like. If you\'ve pledged for three decks and three decks are available, you can get one of each or two of one and one of another or three of one kind, etc. BUT (and that\'s a big but) we aren\'t going to allow a Backer who\'s pledged for a half brick, brick or more to mix up the order too much.

We find that both work well on our end! We will also combine your items when it comes time to ship. All you need to do is send us a message from your primary account and let us know which levels/accounts are yours. Sun, Aug 27 2017 5:45 pm EDT The piece I want has already been backed. Do you have another one? Each of my pieces are unique. However, there is always the chance that I have something similar in stock or coming up. To find out, message me directly with the pledge level and campaign number. I will check my pieces and get back to you. Sun, Aug 27 2017 5:45 pm EDT You don\'t have any descriptions of your items. Why not and how do I learn more? Kickstarter only allows us a certain amount of characters when creating a project, and we often exceed the limit. We\'re working on ways to get around this without cutting down the rewards. Until we find a work-around and you\'re seeking a more information about a piece, feel free to visit our website where there are descriptions of most of the woods we use - just click on the picture of the bowl you like and a new tab will open up. You can also ask us directly, and we\'d be happy to let you know! Sun, Aug 27 2017 5:45 pm EDT Are your bowls food-safe? This is a question we get a lot! While the answer is yes, please note that they are not specifically made for food use and will lose the shine you see in the photo if used as such. Bowls may also have naturally occurring cracks or voids that may make them unsuitable for food usage. Sun, Aug 27 2017 5:45 pm EDT I want to use my bowl for food. Does it matter what ""finish"" is on my bowl? Any of the bowls are able to hold food (but be aware of through-holes and splits as these are not good for food service) and can get wet but it could affect the finish depending on which type you get. If you are looking for a bowl solely for food use, I would suggest the tool or the rustic finish. Over time with continued use, the bowl will begin to take on its own patina. The G+ finish (while food-safe) is not recommended for food use as it will lose the shine you\'ll see when you first receive it. Sun, Aug 27 2017 5:45 pm EDT How do I wash the bowl if I\'m using it for food? You can hand wash the bowls with soap and water but don\'t let it soak. Let it air dry, and you\'ll be good to go. Do not put the bowl in the dishwasher! Sun, Aug 27 2017 5:45 pm EDT Do you make custom items? All my bowls are custom made! But if you mean will I make something according to your specifics, the answer is no. If there is something you’re interested in in particular (wood, shape, size), feel free to let me know. What I can do is keep an eye out as I work and if I have something come along that fits the bill, I will let you know. Sun, Aug 27 2017 5:45 pm EDT Why is the international shipping so expensive for some of the bowls? USPS first class international shipping only allows us to send a package up to 4 pounds and costs up to about $50. When over 4 pounds, the shipping shifts to USPS Priority International, which can run between $50 - $80 depending on the weight of the package, the size of the package and the recipient location. Sun, Aug 27 2017 5:45 pm EDT Why do international backers have to pay have to pay customs fees? Isn’t this considered a gift? According to the Kickstarter rules and regulations, back and then receiving an item from a campaign is not considered a gift; it is merchandise. Then in compliance with the United States Postal Service International Shipping rules and regulations, we must legally claim the items as merchandise and include the actual price on the customs declaration form. To not do so would be considered fraud. Unfortunately for some of our international backers, there are a few countries that will apply an additional customs and/or postal fee, which is the responsibility of the backer. Sun, Aug 27 2017 5:45 pm EDT If I buy a bowl as a gift for someone else, will you send it directly to them? Absolutely! You’ll be able to choose the address in the survey at the completion of the project. Also, please send me a message just so I know this is the case. Sun, Aug 27 2017 5:45 pm EDT What is ikebana? Ikebana is the Japanese art of flower arranging, which can be further defined as ""a disciplined art form in which the arrangement is a living thing where nature and humanity are brought together"" according to Ikebana International. (http://www.ikebanahq.org/whatis.php) Sun, Aug 27 2017 5:45 pm EDT How do the flowers stay in the ikebana vase? Ikebana arranging uses a kenzan, or spiky frog, which is a heavy lead dish with affixed spikes to hold the flowers. Each of my ikebana levels will come with a kenzan. Sun, Aug 27 2017 5:45 pm EDT So when you find a piece of wood, do you make your bowls out of it immediately? Don\'t I wish! Bowls made out of “green” wood cannot be sanded smooth and often warp and crack. In addition, a “gallery quality” finish is not possible on wet wood. I shape each bowl from the “green” wood and coat each “bowl blank” with wax. The blanks are then put in my “bowl garages” and stored for a year or more. This process stabilizes the wood by allowing it to dry slowly and release the tensions in the wood. If the bowl blank survives intact, I then put it back on the lathe and “finish turn” it into it\'s final shape. This process ensures the completed bowl will not warp or crack as is common for bowls turned from “green” wood. Sun, Aug 27 2017 5:45 pm EDT How do you begin a project? I choose the “bowl blanks” suitable for the designs to be offered as the rewards. The blanks are finished into the completed rewards as described above. I complete many of the bowls in the weeks before the project launches to make sure the forms I want can be completed from the bowl blanks I have chosen. After the campaign is complete, I mark the bowls and ship them off to their new homes! Sun, Aug 27 2017 5:45 pm EDT ?  ']"
