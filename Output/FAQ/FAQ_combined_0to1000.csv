15,"["" Who, or What is Razroo? Razroo is a software consulting company(https://www.linkedin.com/company/razroo) based out of NYC. It was started by Charlie Greenman(https://linkedin.com/in/charliegreenman/). Right now the firm isn't too large, and employs about 4-5 part timers. Collectively, we have experience working for Fortune 500 companies, such as Goldman Sachs, Verizon, and Merrill Corporation. We have one product on the way, as well as one book. Both of which will be complete by December 2020. We are trying to establish a very strong open source presence within the community, and this Kickstarter helps contribute to that cause.

20,"[' What file formats can I export from Block Modeller? We currently support exporting FBX and STL.  FBX is a general purpose file format used in many Graphics packages.  STL is used primarly for 3D printing. Tue, Feb 14 2017 5:09 am EST How does it work? You are given a 3D workspace, a cursor, and a palette.  You can move the cursor within the 3D workspace.  To place a block you move the cursor where you want it, and press space.  Press delete to remove.  The palette lets you pick what shape, color and texture you want to put down. Tue, Feb 14 2017 5:17 am EST How does it compare with existing 3D Modellers? The main problem is converting an idea in your head into a visual 3D representation.  The tools vary from low cost applications like Blender, to high end systems like 3D Studio, Maya, and others.  All of them require a fair amount of skill to use.  Block Modeller is low cost, and easy to use.  Playing with toy bricks easy. Tue, Feb 14 2017 5:20 am EST ?  ']",3

We've run ours for hundreds of hours with no problems. We even run extremely long print jobs of over 40 hours. Typical print times are in the 20 minutes to 5 hours range.

Android and iOS are a high possibility and I'm hoping I'll be able to look into porting the game to mobile devices when its ready for release. As for consoles, the engine I'm using currently doesn't support console porting so it'll be far into the future if MWDH comes to consoles. Wed, Jul 4 2018 8:51 pm EDT Will the game be available in other languages? The game is being written in English and will be released in English.

77,"["" How many stories will the book have? Our current plan is for 18 stories of no more than 7,000 words. That's 126,000 words, so the size of a fairly hefty novel. Of that we hope that at least 6 stories will come from Bristol writers and at least 6 from Caribbean writers. As we are having open submissions, we hope the remaining stories will come from all over the world. We haven't specifically promised this in the project description because plans rarely survive contact with reality. We might get sent a really good 10,000 word story, or some great flash fiction. And finance-wise it is always hard to know what you'll be able to afford as different rewards have different costs so you don't know how much money you'll end up with. But it is what we are aiming for, and hopefully we'll get there. Mon, Oct 31 2016 1:06 pm EDT Where will the money go? By far the largest chunk of expenses in the budget is paying the authors. We plan to pay professional rates, which are 6c per word. You can do the math. After that he biggest bill will probably be printing the paper copies of the book, followed by Kickstarter fees. We also need to pay for a cover, and there are various other people who will be working on the book who need to be paid - Roz and Jo, for example. Cheryl does not get any money until the book makes a profit, which isn't going to happen as a result of the crowdfunding alone unless we go well over the base target. Mon, Oct 31 2016 1:20 pm EDT What is the deadline for submissions? Steady on, tiger, we haven't funded yet. Assuming we do fund, we'll have a planning meeting and set out the calendar for the production process. As we said above, we'd like to have the book ready for Worldcon in Helsinki. We'll open submissions once we have that all sorted. Mon, Oct 31 2016 1:20 pm EDT Aren't pirates awful people? Yes, most of them were. Privateers - men like Drake, Grenville and Woodes Rogers in his early career - were pretty nasty too, especially if you happened to be a Spanish treasure galleon. We are not expecting all of the stories to make pirates heroic. On the other hand, if you send us a story about brave pirates fighting against an evil empire we won't reject that out of hand either. Mon, Oct 31 2016 1:20 pm EDT Where did you get that hat? From the Pirate Supply Store in Valencia Street, San Francisco.

We’re not at liberty to discuss this, but I think it has to do with a late-night ouija session and a message from the future :D Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT What platforms is Antstream available on? At launch, the Antstream application will be available on Mac, PC, Xbox One, Android tablet and mobile devices, Nvidia Shield, and Amazon Fire Stick, with other platforms becoming available later, including PS4 and Nintendo Switch. Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT What games do you have on Antstream? Please see https://www.antstream.com/gameslist for our list of currently available games. Remember, these are just the games we have announced, we have many more in the pipeline and are constantly having conversations to expand our game list, so watch this space! Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT Why don't you have game X? I want to play it! Although we have a vast catalogue of licensed games, there will always be a few games that we haven't yet licensed. If there are games you'd particularly like to see on the platform, please let us know in the comments, on Facebook or Twitter, or on our Discord server and we'll see what we can do! Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT Can I add my games to Antstream? If you have the licence to a classic game or a catalogue of titles, we have a pledge amount perfect for you that will allow you to add your games to the platform! Please see the Homebrewer pledge amount for more details. Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT How does Antstream work? Antstream Arcade is an app that gives you instant access to a vast catalogue of games. Once you have our app there is nothing further to download. All the games are streamed directly to your devices including your mobiles, tablets and PC’s of almost any spec. Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT Why ‘stream’ games when you can transfer the entire ROM due to them being so small? As we roll forward to support newer games, the size of the games increase. We wanted to create a consistent experience regardless of whether the game is 48k or 480mb. Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT Are you emulating? Yes. Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT How do you stream it? Antstream technology enables us to run the games in the cloud and stream the display directly to your devices in real-time. It is like using an ultra fast remote PC connection. Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT How do you play games on Antstream? You can play Antstream Arcade on almost any device. All games on Antstream have been custom configured by our retro experts to be playable with keyboard, gamepad and touch screen interfaces. We recommend using a Microsoft Xbox One style gamepad for the best experience. Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT Where is Antstream available? Antstream will be global, but we will initially start rolling out the service in Western Europe and the US.  Please follow us on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter for the latest news on new territories being added to the service. Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT What are Antstream Challenges? We have created exclusive multiplayer challenges for the most popular games on Antstream. These original challenges enable you to compete against your friends and the global Antstream community. For more information please see here - https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/234135283/antstream-retro-gaming-reborn/posts/2482657 Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT What type of internet connection do I need for Antstream? Antstream will work on a very good 4G connection, but WiFi / wired Ethernet provide the best experience.  Due to the unique way this service works, playing games over a mobile network may not currently give the best experience.  Also, as with other streaming services like Netflix, it will use larger amounts of data than some other gaming apps. Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT Will your games be instant loading or will we get the joys of loading screens and music on old systems like the C64? Antstream will be instant loading, but if there is enough demand for it, we will look to add the option for the full loading sequence at a future point, as we do recognise that was an integral part of the original experience, and it'd be a shame to miss out on all those great chip tunes. Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT Do you have any examples of Antstream in action? Our most recent outing can be found at twitch.tv/gamedigital at 11 hours and 15 minutes where we had a retro hour as part of Gameblast 19. We played Double Dragon, Speed Ball 2 and Treasure Island Dizzy. We had a great response and it really shows off some of Antstream’s features, as well as how smooth the streaming is. Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT For those of us whose pledges include a subscription, when will the subscription start from? Will it start from the official launch date in late 2019, or will the subscription start during the beta stage? Your subscription will start when Antstream goes fully live later this year. Consider the early access as a BETA where you get to experience Antstream and feedback to the team without it affecting your subscription. Thu, May 2 2019 9:38 am EDT ?  ""]",16

98,"[' Can I support you and get one of the rewards without pledging on the Kickstarter site? If for whatever reason you are unwilling or unable to pledge on the Kickstarter site, then you can email me at jik@kamens.us and tell me how much you would like to pledge, and then if they campaign succeeds I will arrange payment with you separately and give you the reward corresponding to your pledge amount. However, please think twice before doing this, because such a pledge will not count toward the campaign total on Kickstarter, and I will not be able to proceed with porting my add-ons to Thunderbird 78 unless the campaign on Kickstarter hits its goal. If you would like to pledge via Kickstarter but you are running into technical difficulties, then you can click on ""Help Center"" at the bottom of the page and then ""Contact us"" in the upper right corner to open a support ticket with Kickstarter. Fri, Jan 24 2020 12:36 pm EST Will I have to buy a separate license for each computer or Thunderbird profile I use? Add-on licenses will be per-user, not per-computer or per-profile, so you will be able to use your license on multiple profiles and computers WITHIN REASON. Please be kind and don\'t cheat by sharing licenses among users. Remember that if I am not taking in enough license revenue, then maintaining the add-ons will not be sustainable and I\'ll have to stop, so please play fair. Thu, Jan 23 2020 7:58 pm EST If I\'m a previous donor to your add-ons, do I have to donate again to the Kickstarter to get a discounted license? Previous donors to my add-ons get a separate, special deal! I\'ve emailed most of my previous supporters already, but some have changed email addresses since they donated, and I might have missed a few. If you\'ve donated in the past and didn\'t receive an email from me, and you can give me the means to verify your previous donation (e.g., whether you donated through Paypal or some other way, what email address you used, perhaps you even still have the receipt that Paypal sent you), email me at jik@kamens.us and we\'ll work it out. Having said all that, if it\'s important to you for one or more of my add-ons to remain available past Thunderbird 78, then you should consider pledging to the Kickstarter even if you previously donated, because if the Kickstarter doesn\'t succeed I\'m not going to be able to do the work to port the the add-ons. Note that the previous-donor and Kickstarter deals ""stack,"" so you\'ll still come out ahead. Thu, Jan 23 2020 7:58 pm EST Are your add-ons going to remain open-source? TL;DR I am not sure it will be feasible for the add-ons to remain open-source, but if it is then they will. I have been maintaining add-ons for nearly a decade, and in that time, less than 2% of the people using them have contributed to support them. Given the extent and frequency of recent Thunderbird changes necessitating significant updates to add-ons, that level of financial support is no longer sustainable for me. I tried to solve that, before launching this campaign, by finding volunteers to help with maintaining the add-ons, but none stepped forward. I even offered to give someone all of the contributions received for the add-ons for the next year, and 50% for five years after that, and still, no one was willing to do it. I\'ve therefore reluctantly concluded that the only way I can sustain continuing to maintain the add-ons is if I can guarantee significantly higher recurring revenue than the voluntary contributions. That is why I am using a Kickstarter campaign: the campaign will not succeed unless enough people commit, and it\'s that commitment that I need to be able to continue. If I keep the add-ons open-source after doing the work to port them to Thunderbird 78, then anyone will be able to take the source code, remove the licensing code, and repost them as different add-ons on addons.thunderbird.net, undercutting what I am trying to do here and bringing us back to it being impossible for me to sustain continuing to maintain them. Even now, when this Kickstarter campaign has hundreds of backers and thousands of dollars pledged, if a qualified person stepped forward and volunteered to take over maintenance and port the add-ons to Thunderbird 78, I would cancel the campaign and keep the add-ons free and open source. My goal here isn\'t to rake in cash, it\'s to make it possible for the add-ons to continue to exist, and I have a strong preference for open source when it is viable. But it isn\'t viable if no one is willing and able to keep maintaining the add-ons for free. One caveat: if the Kickstarter campaign succeeds, then I will look into the possibility of making the code open-source under copyright terms which prevents it from being used to compete with the licensed add-ons. I would love to do that if it turns out to be possible. However, I am not sure it will be, because I fear I will end up spending the time and money that was supposed to be spent maintaining the add-ons instead on lawyers suing people violating the copyright.

Unlike my past Kickstarter campaigns, this campaign includes items of apparel such as the tote bags and socks! These are larger items and require larger packaging. The Royal Mail prices are based on the size and weight of packages, so the shipping costs are more expensive for this Kickstarter to compensate for any rewards that include socks or tote bags! If you choose pins only - don't worry!

Thu, Jan 10 2019 4:24 am EST Why should I upgrade my shipping to tracked? Unfortunately, the Royal Mail can only reimburse costs of tracked or signed for mail. If you leave your package as standard, there is no way for me to keep track of where it is if it gets lost or delayed and I can't claim to reimburse your costs for you (or myself if missing items are replaced!)

Tue, Nov 15 2016 4:17 pm EST Why are the tiers so expensive? Many kickstarters offer a lot of exciting rewards cheaply, because they don’t really need the money for development - they treat Kickstarter as a cheap marketing platform. We cannot afford that. Underselling, overpromising and offering physical goods are all a liability for many Kickstarters, and we want to be secure and realistic in everything we offer. Tue, Nov 15 2016 4:18 pm EST Why a custom engine? A custom engine involves more initial work to set up than using the likes of Unity, but in the long-term produces a hosts of benefits. It gives us more flexibility to make changes specific to the project, and in particular makes procedural generation techniques much easier to develop. It also makes us less dependent on an engine service that can lose support or change ownership in future. Tue, Nov 15 2016 4:18 pm EST Why a 3D roguelike? Firstly, we want Jupiter Hell to look amazing. Secondly, we think there are a class of gamers out there who have never tried a traditional roguelike, potentially being turned off by basic graphics or intimidating interfaces. The likes of the new X-COM games have shown that with more modern looks you can pull in bigger audiences and get them hooked on more engaging mechanics than most popular games offer. Jupiter Hell could be the game to get a new generation hooked into this awesome and underappreciated genre. Tue, Nov 15 2016 4:18 pm EST Why so much money? This is an ambitious project, especially with the sound and visuals required to make a really mind-blowing game. This money is needed to properly fund dedicated and professional staff to work solidly on Jupiter Hell, whilst also providing contingency to fund us through any potential setbacks. We have seen too many underfunded projects struggle to achieve their overpromised aims - this level of funding will let us avoid that pitfall. Tue, Nov 15 2016 4:18 pm EST Why so little money? Jupiter Hell is relying on a small team, and doesn’t need the millions that AAA games rely on. Having much of our staff concentrated in Eastern Europe also helps keep many costs down.

There will be online highscores and other meta gameplay elements (weekly seeds, ghost files, etc), but true multiplayer is not planned at this stage. Tue, Nov 15 2016 4:18 pm EST Will there be support for mods? Yes! Mods are awesome and we will fully support the modding community. Tue, Nov 15 2016 4:18 pm EST Is this like Alien Breed / Shadowgrounds? No. (Those games are awesome, mind!) It shared the same top-down perspective, but the gameplay is very different - it's turn-based, tactical, relying on clever decision making rather than twitch shooting. Sun, Nov 20 2016 9:43 am EST ?

The $2,500 is only the MINIMUM that must be raised to fund the project through Kickstarter. You can still pledge and receive the rewards until MIDNIGHT June 30th. Sun, Jun 5 2016 1:34 pm EDT ""P.J. Jacobs Working Title"" is a strange name for the documentary. Is that really what you\'re going to call it? No. That\'s just a generic ""placeholder"" for where the title would be in the graphics. Truth is, we really don\'t know what it\'s title will be yet. Why? Because until we complete principal shooting, there is always the possibility that some unknown aspect of the story will be the driving force in the documentary, and will dictate the title. So hang on to your seats: the adventure is just beginning!!! Sun, Jun 5 2016 1:38 pm EDT If you raise more than $2,500, what will you do with the extra money? The Kickstarter goal amount is only a minimum pledge amount for Kickstarter funding.  It will not cover the entire amount of the production since the producers will also use some of their own funds as well. However, what the additional funding does do is help raise the production values used on the film. That means things like being able to pay for  more/better historical film clip rights, or being able to spend more time during the principal shoot and get even better raw footage for the project. Sun, Jun 5 2016 1:46 pm EDT What happens if you don\'t reach the $2,500 goal by June 30? As with all Kickstarter projects, If the project succeeds in reaching its funding goal, all backers\' credit cards are charged when time expires. If the project falls short, no one is charged. Funding on Kickstarter is all-or-nothing. Fri, Jun 17 2016 1:28 pm EDT ?  ']",4

Wed, Sep 13 2017 7:32 pm EDT Why is shipping Authorities That Be so expensive outside of the US? This thick and bootyful book is estimated to weigh between 2 and 2.5 lbs and that is expensive to ship. We're staying on the safe side. Wed, Sep 13 2017 7:32 pm EDT Does Authorities That Be come in another language? The book only comes in English as of now because printing in another language means printing a whole other book. Fortunately, the comic is translated to French and you will be able to choose between English and French for all your PDF files. FR: La BD n'est imprimée qu'en Anglais pour le moment parce que ça coûterait double de l'imprimer dans une autre langue. Heureusement, la BD est traduite et tous vos PDF viennent en Français aussi!

Thu, Sep 21 2017 11:04 pm EDT Does the Private Commission get featured into the book? No. The private commissions will be completed after I’ve sent all the files to the printer and will have nothing to do with the actual book. The commissions can also be any subject. Fri, Sep 29 2017 7:38 am EDT How can I get in the book? You cannot be into this first book as it is already finished but you can take the Immortal Cameo Reward to become a detailed background character into the next book! This reward is very limited. Available while it lasts. Fri, Sep 29 2017 7:38 am EDT How many characters can I ask for in the Private Commission? There is a limit of three.

Fri, Sep 29 2017 7:38 am EDT Can I get a private commission from you outside of Kickstarter? Fri, Sep 29 2017 7:38 am EDT How large can we ask the printing file to be for a Private Commission? The maximum on the largest side would be 32 inches. Keep in mind that the largest the file, the longer it will take to complete the art. TAKE NOTE: Requesting a large artwork in combination with a tight deadline will result in an extra charge. Sat, Sep 30 2017 7:14 pm EDT How soon can I get the Private Commission done? If you have a deadline for your commission, make sure to let me know as soon as the campaign is over. Also have any reference ready for me when we start to speed-up the process (for example, photos of your wife or pet) and clearly state what you want. Visuals examples are great.

After you pledge, please send us a message via Kickstarter, stating your top three music documentaries from our programme, by order of your preference - 1st, 2nd, 3rd. We will allocate screening tickets, on a first pledged, first served basis. Once the campaign has come to an end (6th Sept. 2014) we will allocate a screening to you, depending on availability and the order of preference you have made in your pledge to us. We finalise your booking via Hackney Picturehouse Cinema. Sun, Aug 17 2014 6:42 pm EDT When do I get my pre-ordered ticket? Once the campaign has come to an end, (6th Sept. 2014) you will receive a confirmation email with the movie title, date and the time of screening. You can collect the tickets at the Picturehouse box office on the day of the screening. Sun, Aug 17 2014 6:46 pm EDT How do I buy multiple tickets at the same price level? Just multiply your pledge by the amount of tickets you require at that price level. Eg - 2 Q&A tickets: 2 X £15 = £30. Then pledge £30 at the £15 or more level. We'll figure out your allocation from there! Wed, Aug 20 2014 5:11 am EDT ?  ""]",3

389,"[' What happens if we unlock the ""Silver Edition"" of the Visionary Tarot? If we unlock the chance to reprint that deck, you will have the OPTION to either choose between SILVER or GOLD. If you would like BOTH decks you can either add $45 to your current pledge OR choose a new pledge option that I will make once they are unlocked. (option 1) After the goal is unlocked, I will be creating a new reward package where you can pledge to receive both the silver and gold Tarot. It is an easiest way to update your pledge. You would just need to go to the main page and find  the new reward box that says ""GOLD + SILVER DECKS"". When you click on the box it will say ""Select this reward instead"". Then you just need to confirm the change. (option 2) If you do NOT want to choose the new reward package (specifically those of you who are early birds or have packages that contain specific items) You can ADD ON the Silver deck by adding $40 to your current pledge. You will then answer in the survey at the end of the campaign that you would like to receive both the Gold and Silver editions. (option 3) If you have pledged for the ""Double Decker"", that price will stay the same because the second deck is already discounted. You may still choose which colors you prefer. However, if you would like to add a THIRD DECK it will only be $35. Let me know if you have any other questions! Sat, May 25 2019 9:29 am EDT How do I add on an item? Add-ons are available for almost all of the reward options. All of these add-ons are listed in the description of each pledge reward. When you are selecting your reward you have the option to pay extra  in order to add other items. IF YOU HAVE NOT PLEDGED YET: Each reward will say something like ""Pledge $45 or more"". After you select your reward you will be taken to a pledge confirmation page. On that page you will see there is a text box where you have the option change the amount of your pledge. (Kickstarter automatically adds shipping to the deck. If you are in the US, the amount will say $50). So if you would like to add on a pin, you would type $60 in the text box for your pledge amount. When you do this, I will be able to see that you have paid extra for your reward. I will message you and ask you which of the add-ons you would like to add to your pledge. IF YOU HAVE ALREADY PLEDGED: When you go to the project page you will see that your pledge is now listed first with a blue banner saying ""you selected"". There is a green banner at the top of the page that says ""you are a backer!"". Click on either of these links and they will take you to another page to ""manage your pledge"". On this page you are able to view your pledge description, change payment methods, cancel, and change the amount of your pledge. To update your pledge amount, click ""CHANGE YOUR PLEDGE"". You are then brought to another page where you can change your pledge amount. You will also be able to see list of the add-ons in your pledge description. If you have any more specific questions please message me! Sat, May 25 2019 9:28 am EDT What are Stretch Goals? Stretch goals are rewards given to everyone when the project surpasses it\'s base goal. When we hit certain milestones (i.e. $7,000) certain rewards are then ""unlocked"". When each reward is unlocked, those are automatically given to every backer for free as a ""thank you"" from me! Sat, May 25 2019 9:28 am EDT When does my card get charged for my reward? You are not charged unless the project surpasses its goal by May 31, 2019.

Sat, Sep 19 2015 11:56 am EDT How can I tell what words have already been adopted? Just look them up on Wordnik! If they’re adopted, they will show their adopter’s name. Tue, Sep 15 2015 11:17 am EDT What if someone else has already adopted the word I want? We are sorry. :-( But we’re happy to help you find another beautiful word! Tue, Sep 15 2015 11:17 am EDT What do I do if I want to adopt more than one word? To adopt more words, just add $25 per extra word to your backer donation (for the awards that include adopted words). Please only add extra words at the $25 and $45 levels. If you want extra words at other levels, email us! Tue, Sep 15 2015 9:22 pm EDT I found this word you said was “missing” in another dictionary! We’ve only been checking OED and MW3, as they are the largest, and are often considered the “dictionaries of record” for English. If you found a missing word in another dictionary, that makes us very happy! We’ll still add examples for it, though, to help the people who use Wordnik. Tue, Sep 15 2015 11:17 am EDT Aren’t all these words already in the Urban Dictionary? Some of them definitely are! We think the Urban Dictionary is tops (hi Aaron!), and we have lots of fun using it. But with Wordnik, we want to show direct evidence of how words are used, through real sentences that show how a word is used in context. (And we link you to the source so you can better understand who uses a word, and why.) Tue, Sep 15 2015 11:17 am EDT You keep using that word. I don’t think it means what you think it means. Words often have several meanings or shades of meaning. We encourage discussions! You can look up any word on Wordnik (even if we have no data at all for it yet!) and leave your take in the comments section — just log in first. (But we still recommend against becoming involved in a land war in Asia.) Tue, Sep 15 2015 11:17 am EDT This word is useless! That’s okay, you don’t have to use it!

Tue, Sep 15 2015 11:17 am EDT I’d like to back your project but the word I want to adopt has some dumb examples. Can those be cleaned up? As part of our project, we will be refreshing and cleaning sentences across the site, and adopted words will get cleaned up first. Tue, Sep 15 2015 11:17 am EDT Can I access the raw data? We want to be able to make the data we find openly licensed, and we’re looking into ways to do that now. If you have a specific use case in mind, please email us! It will help us with our planning. Tue, Sep 15 2015 11:17 am EDT Will you share with Wiktionary and Urban Dictionary? Yes! We would be very happy if Wiktionary editors used our API to add example sentences to Wiktionary entries. We use Wiktionary definitions, so fair’s fair! Tue, Sep 15 2015 11:17 am EDT What if Oxford and Merriam-Webster start adding all these missing words? We will be very, very happy. (Especially if they work out all the etymologies.) We want all English words to be lookupable! Tue, Sep 15 2015 11:17 am EDT I want the poster! Will you be selling it separately? We won't be selling the Kickstarter poster separately -- that will be unique for backers. If there's interest we may do a different poster. Tue, Sep 15 2015 11:17 am EDT I’m super-into machine learning! How can I find out more about how you’ll find these sentences? We’ll be blogging about the process and sending updates to backers. Tue, Sep 15 2015 11:17 am EDT I want to help Wordnik in a different way! We love volunteers! Email us at feedback@wordnik.com! Tue, Sep 15 2015 11:17 am EDT Does a word have to be in a dictionary before I can use it? Nope. Tue, Sep 15 2015 12:59 pm EDT Does the poster reward include a word adoption? The poster is a stand-alone reward ... but if you really want a joint poster + adoption reward, please let us know! Tue, Sep 15 2015 12:59 pm EDT Who made your video? Matthew Green, of Matthewtown.

500,"[' What is the video resolution We need to test the equipment more thoroughly to be certain, but the way things are now, it looks like: Live Streaming:  360p Recorded Streaming:  720p (HD) Download:  360p All of the video options will be ""recorded streaming"" unless it specifically says ""live"" or ""download"". Thu, Apr 27 2017 9:10 pm EDT how long do we get recorded streaming I want to say ""forever and ever"" or ""as long as we both shall live"" or something like that.   But the reality of the internet is wacky.   I have one huge website that is now 19 years old (javaranch/coderanch) and another that is 21 years old (richsoil/permies) so I think I can safely say ""at least a decade - probably much more."" Mon, May 1 2017 1:59 pm EDT If I watch all the video, do I get certified? Nope.  That\'s only for folks that attend the event in person. Tue, May 2 2017 10:16 pm EDT When does the kickstarter finish and when is the event happening? The kickstarter finishes Wed, May 24 2017 2:08 PM MDT. The PDC starts on May 28. Tue, May 2 2017 10:46 pm EDT How soon after the sessions do you anticipate releasing the \'download\' version of the videos? I would say a week or two after the ATC. Thu, May 4 2017 8:01 pm EDT Provided we have the hard drive space and the desire, could we have the option of a high-def download as well? We are considering it.  There are a lot of complicated bits and bobs to work out.  We have worked out bandwidth for streaming HD to be much lower than 360p file transfers.  At the same time, there are variables to nail down like ""how big will the files be?""  For our last project 360p files were about 0.8 gigs and the 1080p files were about 15 gigs.  To pull the event off, we are currently testing a lot of equipment, and we are testing a lot of internet options.  For the people that have paid $150, we want to give them the live 360p stream, and then it will take even more bandwidth to upload the HD stuff - and we would like them to have those files within hours. Bottom line:  right now we are already doing a lot of gambling with a lot of variables.  We will be able to have clearer answers on this in july. Fri, May 5 2017 7:16 pm EDT Will the course be available to purchase on DVD for people that have dreadful internet connections? That would be something like 100 DVDs.  So, no.  BUT!  Once we are all done with the event, it is possible that we might offer something as a jump drive.   But there are way too many variables right now to be able to offer something like that. Sat, May 6 2017 4:00 pm EDT I see you added the new reward ""ALLFORMATS"".  Is that included in ""BUNDLE""?  Did you forget to add ""ALLFORMATS"" to ""BUNDLE""? Kickstarter does not allow me to change a reward once somebody has selected one of those rewards.   Which makes it hard to insert new rewards.   At the same time, my experience with fulfilling stuff is that there are lots of people helping and ...  if you say one thing but provide another thing, and there is any room left for alternative interpretation, things become less than optimal. So when coming up with the new rewards, I embraced that I cannot change the existing rewards and selected dollar values and wording to make it clear what is offered. That is why the ""DESIGN"" level contains everything in ""BUNDLE"" and everything in ""ALLFORMATS"" and so much more. Mon, May 22 2017 9:34 am EDT ?  ']",8

Additionally, I wanted to make sure many characters who were newer to the MCU/becoming some of the newer focuses of it were included. Sun, Jul 5 2020 5:50 pm EDT Is it possible to see more characters? Yes! In the first series, more support meant more unlockables, and that is also the case here. Future designs are possible. There will still be votable designs if enough funds are raised, and some designs I hope to see include Peter Quill, Peter Parker, and more of the Marvel TV characters. Sun, Jul 5 2020 5:50 pm EDT Can I purchase from the first collection? Yes, but if doing so, please order via Etsy. Orders for the new collection and the old collection cannot be combined into one order. Sun, Jul 5 2020 5:50 pm EDT How might COVID affect pin orders? It's possible a second wave will hit, in which case production may be slowed down in China, so orders may not come as fast as I hoped. Additionally, I am a student, which means my living arrangements during the fall are not entirely determined. Because of this, orders may be shuffled around and might be sent out later than intended. However, I will endeavor to get pins out to backers as soon as possible. Sun, Jul 5 2020 5:50 pm EDT Can I order more than one of the same design? Yes! Backerkit will offer the option to get more than one of each design. Sun, Jul 5 2020 5:50 pm EDT How will stickers work? Since unlocking the tier for free stickers, each backer will receive one free sticker with a character of their choice. Stickers are opaque, weatherproof, fade-resistant, and glossy. They're similar in quality to the kind of sticker you will receive from RedBubble or Society6 and are perfect for sticking on your laptop skin, water bottle, etc. Additional stickers can be purchased at $2 each on the Backerkit survey or $15 for a full set of all characters.

You\'ll receive the month of December photo in which 23 women are gathered around the grand piano on stage at the Tabor Opera House! It\'s a spectacular composition of tastefully uncovered women scattered among those in magnificent Victorian attire! We used the 2003 film ""Calendar Girls"" as our inspiration! Wed, Sep 20 2017 3:02 pm EDT Why did you pick age 50 and older for your models? Although the common rule for something to be considered antique is that it be 100 years or older, according to an article in mentalfloss.com, “An exception to this rule is cars and other items that are subject to frequent wear—they can be called antique when they are over 25 years old.” All my volunteer models have agreed that they’ve been subject to frequent wear, so splitting the difference between 25 and 100 gave us our new 50-year antique designation! But...as you\'ll see in the calendar...none of us feels ""antique""! Thu, Sep 21 2017 12:10 pm EDT Is this a ""family friendly"" calendar? Certainly! Our models and our photographer ensured that the props used for each photo shoot were well placed to provide what we considered to be ""appropriate"" coverage. Some of our models are more covered than others, and there are plenty of curves to be seen, but this calendar is also a joyful celebration of real women\'s bodies.

Doesn’t that make it more safe? “Rehoming fees” have become a real buzz word in recent years. These “rehoming fees” that are exchanged between parties don’t guarantee a safer “transaction”. In fact, they might even do more harm than good. What ensures a positive adoption experience is quality communications between the current owner and the potential adopter. Meeting one another in person and each party asking thoughtful questions about the animal will likely ensure a positive outcome for the pet than any “fee” could ever ensure.  With Home To Home™, no one is in it to make money. It’s intention is to help find the next best home for the pet. When you remove a monetary exchange, then you know intentions are likely good. Thu, Apr 9 2020 1:56 pm EDT Why would someone give away their pet?! Are they bad people?! Thu, Apr 9 2020 1:56 pm EDT How do you ensure that the animal is healthy? Thu, Apr 9 2020 1:56 pm EDT How do you ensure that the animal is going to a good home? Thu, Apr 9 2020 1:56 pm EDT How do you know that the person posting their pet isn’t lying about its history? We don’t. There is no way we can know that, and neither can a shelter. Again, it is our belief that more often than not, people of positive intentions. Generally speaking, we find that people are honest about their pet’s history. To date, we have not had one case of anyone informing us otherwise. Thu, Apr 9 2020 1:56 pm EDT Why doesn’t the shelter just take the animal? Shelters across the U.S. operate at various levels, depending on their staffing capacity, budget, and kennel space (among many other things!). Yes, a shelter might be able to take the animal, but it also might mean that another animal that’s been in the shelter has to be euthanized so that the new incoming animal can take it’s kennel space. It’s a hard reality, but a reality none-the-less. Thu, Apr 9 2020 1:56 pm EDT How do I know I am getting a healthy pet when I adopt via HH? By asking the right questions and having a meaningful conversation with the current owner. Sometimes, the animal might have some health issues.

Meanwhile, we\'ll be working with bookstores and various retailers to ensure New York in Quarantine is widely available in 2021. Preordering on Kickstarter will ensure you receive this book as early as possible. Wed, Sep 30 2020 10:14 am EDT Where are the books being printed?

Their work includes, but isn\'t limited to, fighting COVID-19. As per Kickstarter guidelines, which state that projects can\'t raise funds directly for charity, all contributions will be put towards designing, printing, and distributing this book.

636,"["" What will the glass or t-shirt have on it? Will it be a Beau's logo? The rewards for this project will be branded in the name of the brewery in Rwanda, not Beau's! The brewery in Rwanda is not yet named, or branded, however which is why images are not available of these rewards. The name of the brewery will be established by owner of the brewery, Fina, and the branding will be done by designers in Rwanda as well. Wed, Oct 5 2016 11:24 pm EDT How come beer from the brewery is not offered as a reward? There are two reasons for this! One is that Kickstarter does not allow beer (or any other alcohol) to be offered as a reward. The second reason is that the brewery itself is not open yet, and the beer is currently in the recipe  development phase, and is not ready for sale yet. Mon, Nov 7 2016 1:24 pm EST What is the beer scene like in Rwanda right now? Will this be the first craft brewery? There is a strong market for beer in Rwanda, where it is a popular beverage. Beer is consumed in homes, and out at restaurants and pubs. There are no craft breweries currently operating in Rwanda. Comparable to Canada in the ‘80s or early ‘90s, beer styles are limited in Rwanda and unless it is homebrewed, beer in Rwanda is produced by foreign-owned companies (Heineken, and Skol). Mon, Nov 7 2016 1:28 pm EST Who will own the Rwanda Brewery? Fina Uwineza will be the initial owner, and she has intentions of opening up ownership to her brewmaster when hired, and potentially other key employees. Mon, Nov 7 2016 1:28 pm EST Is this a “sister” brewery to Beau’s? No. Beau’s (and the other partners) will have no ownership in Fina’s brewery, and will take no profit. Mon, Nov 7 2016 1:28 pm EST How many people will the brewery employ? We expect 5-15. It is anticipated that the bulk of the jobs created by this project will be agricultural (growing ingredients) and will impact rural communities. Mon, Nov 7 2016 1:28 pm EST Why is this project significant to the empowerment of women? Two decades after the Rwanda genocide, women have emerged as the country’s nation-builders as creators of jobs, driving forces behind the establishment of a vibrant private sector. Rwanda has recently been ranked the Best Place to be a Woman in Africa, according to the Global Gender Gap Report, and ranked 6th overall in the world in terms of closing gender gaps. It is also one of the most encouraging and supportive places to be a woman entrepreneur in Africa. Rwanda is highly progressive in seeing entrepreneurship as a key driver for transformation, economic development and business growth in its country, particularly for women. Mon, Nov 7 2016 1:28 pm EST What local brewing ingredients are currently being considered? The goal is to make tasty beer with as many local ingredients possible, so that the economic benefits of the Rwanda Brewery extend to the value chain. Possibilities include sorghum, millet, banana, coffee and cassava. There is more cassava available in Rwanda than is being harvested, and other African countries are using it in beer-making. Locally available spicings are also being studied, and we are looking at the feasibility of hop-growing in the region. Beer typically requires some barley malt or classic cereals, as it contributes important enzymes to beer. Areas that grow coffee are also suitable for growing malting barley, and some is currently being grown in Kenya – so we know it can be grown in Africa. Like cassava, barley is not a typical food source in Africa. There is even a possibility of spin-off economy to growing brewing ingredients in Rwanda for the rest of Africa. Mon, Nov 7 2016 1:28 pm EST What about drought and water supply? Drought is not uncommon in Rwanda – in the life of the Rwanda craft brewery, it will see good and bad weather, and needs to sustain itself through both. The team is looking towards brewing with some percentage of ingredients that are drought-resistant, such as sorghum and cassava. Making beer does consume water – but also produces an end product that is typically more than 90% water in content. We are lucky to have Christian Riemerschmid von der Heide from NSI on the consultation team, who, among his other skills, is an expert in water conservation issues in brewing. He notes that water supply issues are common in most part of Africa, and are typically either pollution or drought-based. He has seen models where breweries can be part of the solution, such as becoming a source of clean water, and supplying all employees with free clean drinking water to take home. We will be applying his expertise to this project. Mon, Nov 7 2016 1:28 pm EST What is Uwineza’s background? Fina Uwineza is one of the many women entrepreneurs blazing a trail of enterprise that is driving one of the African continent’s most gender-friendly economic development revolutions from Kigali, Rwanda. Rwandan-born, Fina fled with her family to neighbouring Burundi while a child of roughly 10 years old. She completed her College studies in Kenya taking Travel management, returning to Burundi to work for Transami Air Cargo. In 1992, she came to Canada where she has family and did a refresher tourism course at Algonquin College in Canada’s capital city of Ottawa. In 1998, Fina returned to Rwanda to live with her husband and three sons. She chose to apply her own global travel experiences, studies and work apprenticeships in the sector to start her own business as a restauranteur. She applied her tireless energy and innovative nature to a first-to-market concept bringing Chinese food to the city of Kigali. Launching the Flamingo Restaurant in 2000, Fina rapidly made a name for herself as the restaurant became the go-to place for tourists, foreign dignitaries, visiting corporate executives and local government leaders ready to taste the Asian cuisine. It quickly became a preferred venue for special occasions, business meals and a unique space for special events. One restaurant became two, making the Flamingo brand synonymous with international-class food and hospitality. Fina speaks in English, French, Kinyarwanda and Swahili. As a passionate and successful entrepreneur she is also ardently committed to continuing the strength and position of Rwanda as one of the top four African economies. Mon, Nov 7 2016 1:28 pm EST ?

This would bring your total to NZ$385, which you will need to manually adjust. If you want 2x Namtso Tee, 1x Nomad Crew, and 1x Kailash ¼ Zip, then the cheapest option is the Complete Kit Bundle + an add-on Namtso Tee. This means you would select The Complete Kit option for NZ$310, and then add-on NZ$80 for another Namtso Tee. You would need to manually adjust the total to be NZ$390.

It will also ask for the address to which you would like them sent. Sun, Nov 26 2017 4:10 am EST How do I add to my pledge? You can't pledge more than once, but if you decide to increase your pledge because you would like to add a pair of trousers or a pocket, you can do so by 'amending pledge' and adding to your pledge.  Don't worry if it isn't clear what you would like, to pledge towards, I will send out a survey if the campaign is successful to ask which items, colours and sizes you would like.  If you are unsure, send me a message. Sun, Nov 26 2017 4:10 am EST Can I order more than one pair in different sizes? Yes, you can.  Just add the amount to your pledge, and if they are going to different addresses, don't forget the postage charge.  At the end of the campaign, if it has been a success, I will send out a survey asking exactly what your requirements are in terms of sizes, colours and addresses.  If you are unsure, just send me a message. Sun, Nov 26 2017 4:10 am EST What is Kickstarter? What is Kickstarter?  Kickstarter is a crowd funding web-site which enables start-up and innovative projects, like Hoydens, to seek funding pledges from potential backers/supporters.  Each project identifies a target funding goal, in my case £10,000, and requests pledges.  I am offering to supply trousers and/or pockets depending on the level of pledge offered.  If the goal is met then the pledges are collected and the project is initiated.  If the project does not attract sufficient backing then the people who have made pledges are not charged and the project owner does not receive anything.  It is a relatively safe place for project initiators and backers to help launch new products. Please support me.   I am using Kickstarter to help fund the first production run.  If it is a success then we will place the orders on our manufacturer and open up the Hoydens on-line store in January to take normal orders.  Be one of the first to receive your Hoydens and make a pledge on Kickstarter. Thu, Dec 14 2017 11:46 am EST Are the trousers ethically sourced? Great question. I have a manufacturer in Portugal all lined up that my production manager knows well and assures me is fine. However without seeing it with my own eyes I am not going to claim anything just to get the sales. Once production starts I will visit with a camera and make sure. The fabric is fine and from a great supplier in Lancashire, but again, until I see with my own eyes I won’t be sure. I really want this product to be ethically sourced, but as a newbie in the industry with hardly any cash I have to place my trust in people until I can afford to visit. Once I am sure and have had advice on what to look for and what questions to ask, then I will put it on the website. Until then no claiming to be anything that I’m not.

Next, add the total value of the add-ons you\'d like to your pledge. For example, if you want three Building Bundles, you\'d select the ""City Center"" pledge.  If you want to include three $30 Add-on sets, you\'d pledge for a total of $350: the amount of the City Center Pledge + $90 of Add-ons. If you\'d like to increase your pledge, click the “Manage your pledge"" button that appears next to your pledge amount.  There you can change your pledge level and/or pledge amount. Wed, Jul 1 2020 2:16 pm EDT What is the scale of these buildings? These are designed with 28-35mm figures in mind.  They work great with most miniature games that are on the market today.  Most of the miniatures pictured in the campaign are our Cyberpunk RED miniatures, which are a true-32mm.   Crisis Protocol is a 38mm game and those miniatures work well and are on the large side, but look suitably heroic. True 28mm figures, like old-school GW minis also look good and are on the smaller end of what works. Mon, Jul 6 2020 10:00 am EDT I just want to order Add-Ons - how do I do that? No problem - just pledge at the ""Scouting Level"" pledge, for the value of the Add-on sets you want to order. Most of the Add-on sets are $30 each. For example, if you wanted to order 3 sets of Chainlink Fences and the City Streets set, you would pledge for $120. Wed, Jul 1 2020 2:17 pm EDT What will it cost to ship internationally? For this campaign, we\'re focused on products that are made in our USA office.  These buildings are sturdy - and heavy.  How much shipping will cost really depends on how many buildings you\'re ordering.  If you want a more exact quote, send us an email at info@monsterfightclub.com with what you\'d like your pledge to include. Wed, Jul 1 2020 2:17 pm EDT When do I choose my buildings? After the campaign ends, you\'ll get a link to the pledge manager.   In the pledge manager, you\'ll choose which building bundles you\'d like, and which style you\'d like for each of them. In the pledge manager, you\'ll also be able to add other items: Game Mats, Add-ons, or sets from our previous campaigns. Everyone who pledges get access to the pledge manager, but pledging before the campaign ends really helps to keep the momentum going and unlocks more stretch goals - improving everyone\'s pledge! Wed, Jul 1 2020 2:17 pm EDT How do the stretch soals work?  If I order multiple buildings, do I get multiple stretch goals? Yes and no - it depends on the stretch goal.  Some stretch goals add one free item to every pledge shipment.  The first one, the graffiti wall, works like this: all physical shipments will get one free graffiti wall. Some stretch goals increase the contents of a set, like adding a free steel drum to the chainlink fences set or adding manhole covers to the sidewalk set.  Other stretch goals add something free to every building bundle, so the higher your pledge, the more of those you\'ll get (like the ladder and camera). You can check out the Stretch Goals section of the campaign for full details on each, or send us a message if you want a detailed run-down for the specific pledge level you\'re interested in. Wed, Jul 1 2020 2:17 pm EDT For the STL package, what\'s included?  Do the files come with supports?

Currently, this is over 120 separate files (pieces). Some pieces, like the sidewalks or signs, are flat shapes.  For the physical versions of these, the detail is printed on the surface.  For the STLs, you\'ll have the shape and the connectors, but any surface printing or painting will be up to you to. The files come unsupported.

We’re on Kickstarter because we need your backing to 1) make people aware of just how far underwear can go beyond being, just, well, underwear, and 2) hit the minimums we need for a cost-effective manufacturing run that will meet the quality standards we’ve set for ourselves.

After learning more about the industry, we realized that we had to take a more holistic view of ethics and sustainability since fashion is a globalized industry, no matter what country comes after the “made in…” on the tag. Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT Is everything in the SOMI line machine washable? Yes! (Gentle wash recommended) Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT What sizes and colors are available? Every item will be available in black and more colors will be added as we reach funding goals! Please see our size chart and style descriptions for what sizes they will be available in. Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT Why aren’t The Versatile and The Minimalist style offered in XL+ sizes? We want to provide the best possible customer experience and we have found those sizes did not test well. Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT Why do I have to wait for The Versatile and other styles to be added to the campaign? In order to meet order minimums with the factory, we need to produce at least a certain number of any given style. Same with ordering fabric. These quantities are to ensure we hit minimums. Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT How will we choose the color for the $300k stretch goal? By popular vote! Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT Which tops are best for working out? The Betty and The Deep Dive are best for low impact workouts. So think yoga and pilates, not running. Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT Which tops are best for swimming? Any of them! Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT What top styles are best for a larger chest? The Betty and Deep Dive have the most coverage. Order according to your band size since our fabric has stretch. Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT Are the straps adjustable on all styles? Yes. Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT Are any of the tops padded? No, they’re unlined but double-layered. Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT How many water bottles go into one SOMI set? 6 Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT What is the benefit of the anti-bacterial coating? It helps keep your undies smelling fresh! Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT How should I decide which size is best for me? Use our sizing chart. For tops, prioritize your band size (the width around your ribcage, right underneath the breasts) since our fabric has a lot of leeway in sizing. Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT What is your exchange policy? Tops can be exchanged if not worn, bottoms are final sale. If something doesn’t fit, get in touch with us directly and we’ll make sure to make things right! Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT Where will I be able to purchase SOMI sets after the campaign ends and how much will they cost? At somiapparel.com. $58 for tops, and $28 for bottoms. Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT Can you please break down the fabric composition of SOMI underwear? SustainLuxe is 79% recycled poly and 21% spandex. Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT Is this breathable? Is it safe to wear down there? Yes. Not all fibers are created equal. SustainLuxe features premium recycled poly and elastane woven in a proprietary weaving pattern that results in light, breathable, moisture-wicking fabric. While cotton is good in some cases, getting sweaty or swimming is not one of them since water wouldn’t evaporate. Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT What about microplastic pollution? Microplastics are tiny plastic threads that get released during washing. The worsT offender in microplastic pollution is poly fleece pieces, which release the most fibers. However, while this is undesirable, we wanted to balance the overall environmental impact. No textile is 100% perfect. We believe that the biggest issue in fashion is the volume of mindless consumption and garments practically designed to be disposed of. We believe that by creating multifunctional, durable pieces, we can reduce the number of bras and panties purchased. High quality recycled poly that makes our Sustainluxe fabric is surprising tough stuff! You can also prevent most microfibers by washing using our SOMI SeaSaver Washbag, which will trap microplastics inside its fine mesh. Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT How confident are you regarding your shipping timeline? SOMI will ship within the US 90 days after the campaign finish. While there’s always potentially room for delays in production, we’ve built-in 30-45 days of buffer time. If anything outside of our control comes up, we will be in constant contact with backers for updates. Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT Who is responsible for paying customs duties and taxes? Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT How do I pick which style of top/bottom I want? We’ll send out a survey at the end of the campaign. Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT How will Covid-19 impact production and delivery timelines? We have seen delays in manufacturing in China but most of the issues have eased up by now. The major delays are in air freight, not sea freight, so we don’t expect transportation to be a big hurdle. Our factory is back to full capacity, the only potential areas of delay is the availability of raw materials. We are committed to being transparent and honest about the process so you get a behind the scenes look at all that’s going on! Wed, Jun 17 2020 10:20 am EDT ?  ']",26
832,"["" Will there be any language barriers and how will you overcome them? Like in most English-language news reports you might have seen on the refugee crisis, our aim is to find and interview refugees that can speak English. However, we do have an Arabic translator on standby in Strasbourg, France, in case we need him. He's ready to meet us at a moment's notice and is drafting some standard interview questions for us beforehand. Further, Audrey Courty is fluent in French and Turkish, and has an elementary grasp of Arabic and Indonesian. Wed, Sep 16 2015 3:47 am EDT It's going to be winter in Europe when you travel. Will this be a hindrance? We're prepared to adapt our travel plans to meet the changing nature of the refugee crisis, both manmade, like the closing of borders and the temporary suspension of Schengen (which is likely to change the route refugees will be trying to take to get into Europe), and natural ones, like the onset of winter. Safe to say, we'll be packing warm clothes! Wed, Sep 16 2015 4:00 am EDT Isn't this going to be a dangerous journey? We like to think of this as a backpacking trip through Europe, but instead of sight-seeing we'll be focused on documenting the journeys of refugees. We plan to check into hostels and BnBs as we travel. There wouldn't be any more risks in doing this than your average backpacking adventure. We will be taking insurance and the standard necessary precautions. Beyond that, as journalists, we take calculated risks on a daily basis in order to cover news, and we have developed a keen sense and situational awareness that inform whether or not a certain situation is beyond our capabilities.

840,"[' Why is it called ""Even Me""? The phrase ""even me"" is one of those idioms of Tanzanian English. It\'s used the way Americans would say, ""Me too,"" but coming from a child it sounds so sweet and touching. Always responding with a ""Yes, even you"" not only verifies that child\'s statement, but also confirms his or her essential human dignity. Fri, Jun 8 2012 10:52 am EDT Where will the paintings end up? Ultimately, I\'m not sure. However, I want to show the 24 piece collection anywhere that\'s big enough: airports, galleries, warehouses, banks, you name it. I am currently networking and making connections for venues now (so if you have any recommendations, let me know: jennathorp@gmail.com). I want to go big. The bigger I go, the more value each painting will hold, which will ultimately increase the price. Increasing the sales is crucial, as all proceeds will go to the child. Fri, Jun 8 2012 10:55 am EDT When will you start painting? I will start painting in August after I return to America. Sun, May 15 2011 2:07 pm EDT How long will it take to finish all 24 paintings? Originally, I thought I would finish all 24 paintings by 2014, but I don\'t want to compromise the quality of the work to reach a certain deadline. With that being said, I hope to finish in a timely manner. I am 100% dedicated to this project. Fri, Jun 8 2012 10:53 am EDT Why don\'t the paintings have eyes? “This makes no sense at all. Why would you paint portraits without eyes? The portrait isn’t complete, it’s unfinished – something is missing!” When this statement was directed towards me regarding my even me project, I couldn’t clearly explain why I was, indeed, leaving the eyes out of twenty-four portraits. The faces are large, and it’s quite noticeable that the eyes are missing. In fact, when I showed the first finished painting to Glory, the subject, the initial response from her sisters was, “Glory! Where are her eyes?” Nonetheless, I still hadn’t come up with an eloquent, genuine answer. Instead, I responded: it’s a new type of portrait; I’m exploring with artistic elements such as composition, negative space, and shape. Pre-verbally, it was more, but I couldn’t muster up the words without sounding hostile in myexplanation. However, now I am ready to tell you why I am not painting the eyes. In today’s society, we have access to anything, everything, all the time. On my way to work, I heard an advertisement for a smart phone. A small, curious boy asks his father a question, “Daddy, what are batteries made out of?” He didn’t know the answer off the top of his head, so the father quickly takes out his phone and, with a sigh of relief, types or speaks his son’s question. Within seconds, he explains, “Batteries are made out of five basic components: a resilient plasticcontainer, positive and negative internal plates made of lead, plate separators made of porous syntheticmaterial, electrolyte, a dilute solution of sulfuric acid and water, better known as battery acid, and lead terminals, the connection point between the batter and whatever it powers.” He is happy, his son is informed, and we are convinced to buy a smart phone. Convenient, immediate, accurate: the world is at our fingertips. Not only has technology given us the ability to know all the answers, but it has made every corner of theworld virtually accessible to anyone. I can see the Northern Lights, the ancient pyramids, the Taj Mahal, or the Petrified Forest with a few clicks. I can see whatever I want. This availability makes me wonder: if I’ve seen the images, have Iexperienced it? I know what it looks like, and my imagination can only take it from there. Imagine this situation: my friend recounts in great detail her trip to Zion National Park, and I respond with an unimpressed, “Oh, cool, well, I’ve seen pictures, Iknow.” Or, “Did you make it to Watchman trail, the one that takes about two hours? Hopefully you didn’t hike it during mid-day, because it gets pretty hot. The best time to hike it is either in the early morning or late afternoon. I’ve read all about it. I know.” We can Google Maps any remote spot in the world and speak as though we’ve been there, experienced it. What if all this access and availability is tricking us? Have we truly experienced by solely seeing? What about the other four senses?  What about the emotion and spirituality that come with these? Honestly, I haven’t lived Zion National Park – I don’t know what the canyons smell like, what the wind feels like, what the dust tastes like, or what the desert echoes sound like. So what happens when we see commercials about starving children in Tanzania? We see the white man holding the sickliest, most frail-looking child in an effort to convince us to get involved, to give money, or at least to reconsider tossing our leftovers in the wastebasket. This overplayed commercial has turned into a cliché. In a multitude of settings, school cafeterias, five star restaurants, at our own dinner tables, we hear: “(Child’s name), there are (adjective) kids in (country).”  This is followed by, “So eat your food.” Has the starving child only convinced us to clean our plates? Surely, that wasn’t the objective of the commercial. On the other hand, because we’ve seen the images of the Tanzanian child’s big eyes, her jigger-eaten toes, pointy ribs, and sorrowful face, we have visually experienced her situation. Because we’ve seen it, maybe we can imagine what it would be like, to some extent. But for the most part, we continue on with our normal day-to-day, guilt-free lives: after all, we’re here, they’re there. The reality is, the Tanzanian girl has seen. But she has also smelled, tasted, heard, and touched without needing to use her imagination. Those eyes may have seen her father kill his wife, and then himself. That nose may have smelled the fumes of alcohol that accompany physical abuse. Those lips may have tasted blood after being beaten by a jealous and contemptuous stepfather. Those earsmay have heard her mother, in an effort to support her family, moan as a stranger forces himself into her. And perhaps those fingers have held the paper with her national exam scores, while her heart felt the utter hopelessness caused by an impossible, corrupted test for which the schools cannot prepare their students, and which dictates an unfavorable future. And we think we’ve experienced something by seeing a photograph. Something is missing. Something is not quite right. Andthat is exactly what I want people to feel when they look at a wall of eyeless portraits: dissatisfaction. I hope that this emotion will evoke questions, “Why are the eyes missing?  What has this child seen?” I don’t want to tell the whole story, because we don’t know the whole story. Not one of us, me included, has any idea what these children have endured. If I give the impression that the whole story is told, like it appears to be in the starving children commercial, we leave unchanged. We feel as though we’ve experienced, and thus, can relate. If the eyes, the windows to one’s soul, remain unseen, we feel cheated. We feel wronged, like there is something more, but we can’t know it. Fri, Jun 8 2012 10:58 am EDT ?  ']",5

863,"["" What’s the point? Have you ever been out, wanted to take off your jacket and not known what to do with it? SKAPYA jackets quick convert into a bag which means you don’t have to carry your jacket in your hands, tie it around your waist – or even worse, kept it on and feel uncomfortable. Keep your hands free and avoid being frustrated with something tied around your waist. Mon, Oct 22 2018 10:12 am EDT What happens to the bits in the bag? The Patented technology of the pocket (the way it is constructed and the process of the transformation) means that whatever you have in the bag stays in the bag as it quickly and easily becomes the pocket of the jacket when you transform between functions. Mon, Oct 22 2018 10:12 am EDT Why not use a jacket and a back pack? More often than not, people are out and about without a bag, and when you want to take your jacket off you have no where to put it. Just like having a hood for the rain – you have a carry system when you need to take your jacket off. If you do have a rucksack – go ahead and put your SKAPYA jacket in it as you would any other. The pocket feature does not have to replace a rucksack, it transforms the flexibility and functionality of your jacket. You’ll never have to take a rucksack with you again just to carry a jacket and essentials. Mon, Oct 22 2018 10:12 am EDT Does it look weird? SKAPYA Jackets look awesome, the pocket functionality does not affect the way they look. Mon, Oct 22 2018 10:12 am EDT Can you feel the strap rig? To make the jackets work, only a small piece of fabric and the straps are added, these together weigh 40g in the Pioneer II Jacket which is designed for heavy use. You can’t feel the strap when you are wearing the jacket. Mon, Oct 22 2018 10:12 am EDT I’ve seen these before.. SKAPYA jackets have a patented pocket system that means whatever you have in your pocket you can get to when it is a bag and vice versa. This has not been done before. Mon, Oct 22 2018 10:12 am EDT Can’t decide whether or not to take a jacket out? SKAPYA jackets solve this problem too – take it as a bag with your phone, wallet, keys in it, if it gets colder or wetter your jacket is with you. The ultimate jacket for layering – you can have it one and zipped up against the elements or take it off completely and have it on your back without having to carry a rucksack. Mon, Oct 22 2018 10:12 am EDT What about jackets for ladies? The Pioneer II jackets have a generous cut around the hips and chest, but we haven’t had the capacity to make one yet that is cut to perfectly compliment the female form. Mon, Oct 22 2018 10:14 am EDT Can children wear these jackets? Bigger children might fit into the smaller sizes, but you might be better to wait until I have one ready for kids. Mon, Oct 22 2018 10:12 am EDT Can the jackets be repaired if damaged? If you get in touch and let me know the damage, the ladies in Cumbria might be able to carry out a repair if I ask very nicely with some biscuits. There will be a charge. Mon, Oct 22 2018 10:12 am EDT Do the jackets only come in black? At the moment the jackets only come in black. I’ve found this best for NOT standing out from the crowd when you are travelling, it also hides dirt. The fabric comes in rolls of ½ a kilometre, so to experiment with colour is an expensive business for the future.. Mon, Oct 22 2018 10:12 am EDT How waterproof are the jackets? These jackets are designed to be as waterproof as possible. The fabric is incredibly waterproof and the jackets have features to keep water away from your skin and clothes, including the double storm flap, snipers cuffs, three way adjustable hood, water resistant zips, beaver tail, longer cut… Mon, Oct 22 2018 10:12 am EDT Where do I fill in my size? When the campaign funds, I’ll ask you for your size so the ladies can get going. Mon, Oct 22 2018 10:12 am EDT What kind of fit is the jacket? The Pioneer II jacket is a generous fit so you can move in it and fit layers underneath. Hem and waist single handed shock cord adjusters mean you can quickly and easily take in any excess. Mon, Oct 22 2018 10:12 am EDT What’s the best way for me to care for the jacket long term? It the fabric gets dirty, it can effect the waterproofing and breathability. Wash your jacket at a maximum of 40 degrees using soap suds (not powder or detergent). Let the jacket drip dry. Iron the outside on cool iron, test a corner of your jacket with your iron to make sure it doesn't burn it. The ironing rejuvenates the finish on the outside, helping the fabric to 'bead' and dry faster. Mon, Oct 22 2018 10:12 am EDT How heavy is the jacket? A Medium Jacket weighs 950g. It is tough and made to last. Mon, Oct 22 2018 10:12 am EDT Do you ship worldwide? Yes, let me have your address and I’ll do my best to get one to you. Check out the shipping costs on the campaign page. Mon, Oct 22 2018 10:14 am EDT What is your returns policy? Have a look at the size chart or get in touch to ask about sizing. These are being made to order and the Pioneer II jackets are being sold at a highly discounted price on Kickstarter. Unfortunately refunds can’t be made, but if the size really is not a good fit, let me know within 28 days of receiving your Jacket and we’ll do our very best to get one that does fit. You will have to cover the cost of return postage. Mon, Oct 22 2018 10:14 am EDT ?  ""]",18

Sun, Oct 25 2020 4:24 am EDT Where are the games produced? The expansion and the deluxe base game will be manufactured in Germany at ASS (Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik) and meet highest quality, social and environmental standards. Sun, Oct 25 2020 9:01 am EDT Will there be a solo-variant of the game? Yes, there will be a solo-variant of „Grand Austria Hotel“. Right now we are working and playtesting a solo-mode in cooperation with Virginio and Simone. If everything works out as planned the solo-variant will be provided to all backers after the campaign.

878,"[' Why don’t you mount AIR inside the bike frame? We evaluated all possible mounting options, including inside a bicycle frame. Unfortunately it’s just not possible for any bike tracker to effectively secure network coverage and signal strength inside the frame, so instead we’ve selected low-profile yet secure mounting points, including around the bottle cage or under the bicycle saddle. This means you get the performance you need in terms of accurate tracking and long battery life...which are the most important factors in a device like this one. Wed, Nov 20 2019 11:46 am EST Does AIR work everywhere? Wed, Nov 20 2019 11:32 am EST How sturdy is it?  Can’t it just be knocked off or easily removed? AIR is designed to be sturdy and resist a level of attack but if there’s an attempt to remove or destroy the device, it will have already alerted the bike owner as to what’s happening. Wed, Nov 20 2019 11:32 am EST What kind of warranty does See.Sense AIR have? AIR comes with a two-year manufacturer’s warranty as standard. Wed, Nov 20 2019 11:32 am EST Why does the alarm sound like an alarm clock? We engineered the alarm with a tone that will be noticed...an alarm clock is a nice comparison as it’s an alert that people look out for and respond to. Wed, Nov 20 2019 11:32 am EST How does AIR know when your phone is nearby? AIR uses a Bluetooth connection to determine how close your phone is to the device, so we can ensure that it operates in ‘Fight’ or ‘Flight’ modes accordingly.  The SMS alert you receive will be sent over the mobile operator network. Wed, Nov 20 2019 11:32 am EST Can I use the app to see where my bike is even if it’s not under attack? Yes, you can query the current location of your AIR at any time via our mobile app. Wed, Nov 20 2019 11:32 am EST What if my phone runs out of charge? If your phone runs out of charge, AIR will go into Flight mode; the alarm will sound for 20 seconds and it’ll begin high-powered tracking. AIR will automatically reset the next time your phone comes into Bluetooth range. Wed, Nov 20 2019 11:32 am EST ?  ']",8

Please note that a few of our early bird perks are Heather Metal only due to production time constraints. For all other reward tiers,  we’ll reach out to each individual backer to see what color(s) and size(s) to send your way! Mon, Nov 9 2015 2:42 pm EST When do I get to pick out my size? If/once our campaign is fully funded (cross your fingers!), we'll reach out to our backers via email to collect everyone's size preferences. Here's our sizing chart below as well: Mon, Nov 9 2015 5:28 pm EST Why should I choose Bamboxers over other brands? We might be a little bit biased, but hear us out. Bamboxers are a great alternative to the mass-produced low-quality brands at many stores. You can also skip the designer brands with their hiked-up pricing and superiority complex. Bamboxers are real underwear for real people. And they’re really comfortable. Mon, Nov 9 2015 2:42 pm EST Where are Bamboxers manufactured? Most of the world’s bamboo is growing in China.  It follows that we are set up to manufacture our fabric, and sew together our skivvies over in China, too.  Zahlen, one of the founders, spent 7 years living in Beijing and working in and around the garment industry.  We’ve visited bamboo farms, and done the rounds of production facilities to find ones we wanted to work with. In cooperation with our in-house Beijing based Bamboxers brethren, we oversee everything from the manufacturing to the finishing touches.  Once we know we have a good pair of undies in hand, we will move them to Seattle, WA for the final shipping to customers. Mon, Nov 9 2015 2:42 pm EST Why is bamboo such a huge deal? Bamboo is awesome because it grows quickly, has high crop yields, uses less water than other crops like cotton, doesn’t need pesticides or other chemicals to grow up big and strong, and it works better wicking away odor and moisture than cotton. Plus, it’s super soft. Mon, Nov 9 2015 2:42 pm EST *Bamboxers for Life. Here’s what we were thinking: You can either get 1 pair of Bamboxers every month for 10 years, OR we can mail you 12 pairs at the beginning of each year to wear at your discretion. Let us know what option floats your boat. Mon, Nov 9 2015 2:42 pm EST ?  ""]",8

June 2014: Editing and revision process - each college will review 2 other articles. July 2014:  Final drafts of articles will be due. August 2014: Final read-through and proofreading of magazine. October 2014: Release inaugural issue. (if funds allow) January 2015: Intercollegiate Science Conference & Launch Event Wed, May 7 2014 8:43 pm EDT How often will the journal be published? The money we raise on the Kickstarter will go towards producing, printing, and distributing our first issue (this includes both the print and online website) to our university communities. We plan to continue printing issues at least once a year.  We hope that our first issue will garner enough readership to attract advertising revenue, which will help us continue in the future. Wed, Apr 30 2014 5:14 pm EDT Isn\'t this just another science research review journal? Not at all! ISCJ is completely different than any another science publication.  We strive to reach out to a wider audience, including scientists and non-scientists, both in our writing styles and content. We\'ll have a variety of article types, from reports of the latest discoveries to the science behind things you experience every day. We want to make our content relevant to our communities. Wed, Apr 30 2014 5:14 pm EDT Who will contribute to the articles? This is an undergraduate publication, led and written by undergraduates.  However, we will have support and input from professors and other members of our universities. Wed, Apr 30 2014 5:14 pm EDT Why these 9 colleges? These 9 universities have well-established and successful science publications whose leaders were interested in this project. As the publication grows, we hope to include undergraduates from more colleges interested in this project.  We are currently sticking with these 9 universities, but every year, we will invite other universities to join us.  If your university is interested in collaborating with us in the future, please send us an email at info@icsjournal.org. Wed, Apr 30 2014 5:18 pm EDT Why online AND print? The website will contain shorter features and breaking science news-type articles, while the print publication will contain longer-form, investigative articles. The website will help us reach a more global audience, but the print publication will be necessary for us to build a real, tangible presence in our university communities. Wed, Apr 30 2014 5:14 pm EDT Why do you need crowd-funding when your universities possess enormous financial resources? There are many reasons we seek crowd-funding, both philosophical and practical. Philosophically: 1. Princeton and Harvard do have large endowments, but the vision for ICSJ is not for it to be an exclusive ivy-league journal. Ideally, ICSJ can expand its membership to any university in the nation, and by relying on Harvard and Princeton\'s endowments, it would make ICSJ an unequal initiative. 2. We are a group of undergraduates whose skills and passions in science communication have been cultivated by our involvement in our respective campus science publications. We have come together due to our roles in our university science publications, but our ultimate goal is to use our shared skills/passions to create an entirely new product that takes science out of academia into the ""real world."" Practically: 3. The universities themselves are not as interested in allocating funds to this initiative, since no one university has ownership over the product. For instance, Princeton is not interested in funding our journal because it is not a ""Princeton club /product"". This journal is beyond a single university\'s scope, so we really do need help from everyone and anyone. 4. Since we want to inform the public about science as objectively as possible, we hope to be supported by a wide variety of donors so that no one donor has complete control over our publication. Relying solely on our respective universities for funding may give these universities some control over what ICSJ publishes. That control runs contrary to the principles of scientific integrity and journalistic independence that we hope ICSJ embodies. That\'s why we\'re turning to the public for funding!

You\'ll notice on several canvases there will be splashes of paint on their hair but most of the time it wasn\'t intentional. It is possible to paint on lighter coloured hair with watercolour paints as it does come out easily, but it is best used in moderation. Plus, there is also hair dye, but that tends to be quite expensive. Sat, Jul 21 2012 2:37 am EDT Are you going to paint an elderly person of a young child? I hope so! I\'m much more likely to paint someone elderly because children tend to be very impatient and as such, asking one to sit still for 45-60 minutes might be a bit much for them. It comes to the person. It all comes down to the request. If they ask me to paint them, or they say yes to being a part of the project I will gladly do it. Sat, Jul 21 2012 2:47 am EDT Are you going to paint a mother and child? I would love to, but again it comes down to practicalities. Plus, it depends how young the child is. I will not paint a new born because there\'s always a chance they could ingest the paints which could be a very serious medical emergency. However, given the opportunity, I will gladly paint any relationship I can get. Sat, Jul 21 2012 2:47 am EDT What made you decide to start this project? I really wanted to find a way to capture the personalities and spirit of the people I met on their skin, so that in the future I could see their picture and immediately know what kind of person they were. Normally body painting is used to cover up a person, or to blend them into an existing painting, whereas my project really wanted to focus on making sure the people involved became the work of art. I wanted them to be the center of attention and to showcase exactly who they were to the rest of the world. Sat, Jul 21 2012 2:47 am EDT What kind of paint do you use? I primarily use acrylic paint. I have used other mediums before but oil is too toxic, and watercolour absorbs into the skin too easily. I am hoping that with this kickstarter I can move to a non-toxic body paint that can be worn for hours on end, but up until now, the paint is never on the skin long enough to absorb or cause any damage.

Tue, Jun 16 2020 9:46 am EDT Is this an all-new game? Yes. Overlord is an entirely new game set in Arcadia, the retro-inspired world of Boss Monster. It’s designed by new people, it’s a different genre of game, and it doesn\'t have some of the hectic ""take that"" elements of Boss Monster. Both games share the theme of controlling a videogame-style villain in a pixel art world. Beyond that, they’re totally unique! Tue, Jun 16 2020 9:46 am EDT What are the core mechanics? Each turn, you’ll draft one tile and one token from the market. To maximize your Power, you’ll need to find the optimal placement for your terrain tiles, monsters, and dungeon entrances!  As you fill your map, use Portals to move your monsters and Crystals to multiply your Power. With smart placement and clever combos, you can build a truly dangerous map. Many Bosses will compete, but only one will be declared the ultimate Overlord! Tue, Jun 16 2020 9:46 am EDT That sounds cool, but what if I want more Boss Monster? We have good news for Boss Monster fans! This October, we’ll also be releasing Vault of Villains, a 64-card “unifying expansion” that allows you to combine any Boss Monster sets you own. Add Minibosses to any big set, add Explorer cards to a Miniboss game, and add tons of new variety to your game. Vault of Villains will be available as an Add-On for the Overlord Kickstarter (at 20% off MSRP), so you can get them both at the same time! Mon, Jul 6 2020 10:45 pm EDT What is Brotherwise doing to make shipping costs more affordable? This is a large, heavy game packed with tiles and tokens. We\'ve done what we can to limit international shipping costs in regions where we have local fulfillment partners: Canada, EU, UK, Australia, and Asia. In other regions, the costs reflect shipping fewer units over a longer distance. But in all regions, Brotherwise Games is subsidizing a portion of shipping costs for every unit. Current shipping costs are our best estimates; final shipping costs will be charged in Backerkit, our pledge manager. If you add additional games in BackerKit, shipping costs will go up based on the actual cost of shipping. Wed, Jul 8 2020 8:13 am EDT How will this campaign handle ""backer exclusive"" content? Based on our experiences with past campaigns, we want to reward backers with special content, but we also want to avoid creating gameplay exclusives that are never available again. With this in mind, we are offering one true ""backer exclusive"" (the Original Backer token bag) that will be inserted (instead of a black bag) in every copy of Overlord pre-ordered through Kickstarter and Backerkit. Our final stretch goals unlocked the Limited Edition bonus pack. This content will not be included in the standard edition of the game. Any content marked ""Limited Edition"" may still be available in the future (at conventions, on BrotherwiseGames.com, and as part of retailer incentive kits) but will not be included in the majority of our print run. Backers get it first, and get it free! Mon, Jul 6 2020 3:26 pm EDT Are there plans to publish non-English language versions of the game? This campaign is for the English-language edition of Overlord. It is likely that Overlord will be translated by some of our publishing partners around the world, such as Pegasus-Spiele in Germany and Asmodee in France. However, they will probably wait to see US sales before making those commitments, so the earliest we might see such a version would be mid-2021. If you\'re planning to play the game with non-English speakers, it\'s worth noting that the game is not very language-dependent. The only English text is on the (optional) Boss cards. Everything else is communicated with numerals and icons. Mon, Jun 29 2020 2:56 pm EDT Can the tile tower fit in the box? Yes! The tile tower from the Tower Edition is flat-packed. It\'s designed to be easily assembled and disassembled between sessions, and there will be room in the box to accommodate it. Mon, Jul 6 2020 10:45 pm EDT How will Add-Ons work? What is the pricing? Add-Ons are added at the same time you pay for shipping, in our BackerKit pledge manager. It will open 1-2 weeks after the end of the campaign, and will allow you to purchase extra copies of the game, the new Vault of Villains expansion for Boss Monster, and more! All Brotherwise Games titles currently in print, as well as some out-of-print Boss Monster card packs, will be available via BackerKit. Pricing will be shared after the campaign closes, but many items will be discounted. For more details about Add-Ons, check out Update #13: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/brotherwise/overlord-a-boss-monster-adventure/posts/2882815 Wed, Jul 8 2020 8:15 am EDT Can I get the market board separately as an Add-On? Yes, you may. The tile tower and market board will each be available in BackerKit as Add-Ons, though the price to get them as a bundle is lower than purchasing them separately. Wed, Jul 8 2020 8:16 am EDT Can I pledge just $1 to gain access to the BackerKit pledge manager? Yes. In BackerKit, you will be able to upgrade your pledge by adding The Game ($40) or the Tower Edition ($55). You can also add other Brotherwise products at that time. However, you may not downgrade your pledge in BackerKit. Wed, Jul 8 2020 8:15 am EDT ?  ']",11

958,"[' Can the jacket be used in cold weather? The Cubed Travel Jacket™ is a 4-season waterproof shell. You can wear it as a standalone jacket in temperatures as low as 50°F. For best results in cold weather, use the traditional layering method. Depending on the insulation underneath the jacket, it can be worn comfortably in freezing temperatures. Thu, Apr 7 2016 1:36 pm EDT What are the patent pending Napoleon Pockets  INT/EXT PKTS™? Patent pending twin Napoleon INT/EXT PKTS™ (Interior/Exterior accessible pockets) make it easier than ever for you to access important items, like your phone or wallet, in inclement weather. The pockets have zippers that open on the front of the jacket as well as in the interior. Keep your valuables close to your chest and access them without unzipping your whole jacket. Thu, Apr 7 2016 1:36 pm EDT Are there international custom fees? In the case of shipments outside of the US - duty/taxes if applicable will be the responsibility of the receiver. Thu, Apr 7 2016 1:36 pm EDT What are care / cleaning guidelines Care and cleaning are very minimal.  The jacket is highly durable and coated with a DWR (Durable Water Repellant) finish, so most things will roll right off.  Every so often you throw the jacket into the wash / dryer to clean off the jacket for maximum breathability.

Are they numbered? YES. The prints are numbered and signed by me, Madeline (the artist who painted the original artworks from which the prints are made). In each case, I work closely with the printmaker for a result that is as close to the original painting as possible. I think they look great. Please let me know if you need any further information regarding these prints! Mon, Nov 7 2016 7:12 pm EST ?  ']",2
