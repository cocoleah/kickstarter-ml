I might introduce more rewards of pair or quad Ts but at the moment, what you can do is to select a reward and increase the pledge amount accordingly.

Tue, Aug 28 2018 7:31 am EDT Why 47 portraits? There are 47 portraits because 47 is the median predicted survival rate for someone living with Cystic Fibrosis in the UK today. Tue, Aug 28 2018 7:31 am EDT How long did it take you to photography everyone? It took approximately 8 months to visit everyone and shoot all the portraits. Tue, Aug 28 2018 7:31 am EDT How far did you have to travel? Due to risk of cross-infection people with CF can't mix so I wasn't able to simply hire a room and invite people to come to me, I had to go out and visit each subject in their own homes. I covered approximately 1,300 miles. Tue, Aug 28 2018 7:31 am EDT How have you funded the project so far? I've had tangible costs so far - effectively petrol and a few hotel rooms plus intangible costs - several hundred hours of my time - and I've funded these out of my own pocket. The Kickstarter isn't designed to recoup any of those costs - This is a project I'm very passionate about and I've covered the costs out of my own pocket. The Kickstarter is just to cover the costs of the actual printing of the book. Tue, Aug 28 2018 7:31 am EDT Will there be a digital version of the book? At this moment in time I'm not planning to produce a digital version of the book. The focus of the book is the photography and I don't believe a digital book would communicate the final product as well as the printed medium. Tue, Aug 28 2018 7:31 am EDT What will the text be about? The text that accompanies each portrait will be taken from the recording of our conversation during the shoot. It'll be a one or two short paragraphs that give an insight into that individual and their specific situation. In addition there'll be an introduction by me to the project as a whole. Tue, Aug 28 2018 7:31 am EDT You've already beaten your target - what will you use the rest of the money for? We beat the target for this project in just 8 hours which is fantastic.

Sat, Aug 6 2011 1:42 pm EDT What’s this ‘Pan-Celtic’ stuff all about? We can (& do) talk about this at length! The thumbnail version: The Celts were the ancient tribes that occupied much of Northern Europe before the Romans. They were driven to the western margins (the Iberian Peninsula - Portugal, Galicia & Asturies, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Cornwall, and Brittany) by the Roman, Germanic and Norse invasions, but clung to their languages and culture over the centuries. Each has its own music and cultural influences. The Pan-Celtic movement brings these various traditions together under one rubric. When you mix the tunes together as we do, the differences and similarities start to emerge, bringing the concept of ‘Celtic’ into sharper focus. We’ve pushed the envelope further by including not just the Scottish and Irish traditions of Appalachia and Cape Breton, but also the Celtic elements of Québécois, Cajun and South American music. Fri, Aug 5 2011 11:52 am EDT Do you guys do any original stuff or is it all covers? Well, we play traditional songs and dances which means most of them were composed centuries ago. But they are not ‘covers’ in the sense that we copy someone else’s performance. The arrangements, interpretation, harmonies etc. are entirely our own. In any given set we’ll weave together two or more tunes, usually from different nations, to create a unique original piece of music Fri, Aug 5 2011 11:52 am EDT Why do you play traditional music? All the modern genres of the arts have their roots in older traditions. The traditional music that comes down to us is the best work of thousands of musicians over hundreds of years. All the second rate stuff got filtered out or forgotten along the way. As Celtic artists we have a responsibility to preserve our heritage and pass it along to the next generation so they too can build on it. Just as poems must be read aloud and plays must be performed, traditional music only lives if it is played. Some folk only want to play original music. Some of us choose to focus on the traditional. There’s room for all... Fri, Aug 5 2011 11:53 am EDT Why do you need so much money to make a CD? These days doesn’t everybody do it on a computer in their basement? Certainly a lot can be accomplished in a home setup, but a professional studio offers better acoustics, mics, preamps, software etc. and, most important, the benefit of the ‘ears’ of an experienced sound engineer. We often lay down a dozen or more tracks. Editing and mixing that much requires the right tools. An industry rule of thumb is that every minute of finished music takes an hour of recording and an hour of mixing. For a 55 minute CD that means about $9,000 in studio time. When you add in mastering, artwork, licence fees for any non-traditional material, and the manufacturing cost, the total comes in around $13,500. We’ve spent $8,000 so far which is why we need $5,500 to finish. We waited until the studio work was nearly done so you can be sure the project  really will get completed.

Quick answer: We\'ll charge you for shipping after the campaign ends, when you fill out your Reward Order form. Want more details about this, or why we\'re doing it (to save you money!)? Fri, Mar 18 2016 3:11 pm EDT REWARDS - T-SHIRT: What sizes are available? How will you know what size I want? There are always LOTS of shirt-related questions, and we\'ve got answers to most of them. Fri, Mar 18 2016 3:11 pm EDT CAMPAIGN - Why doesn\'t your Kickstarter actually say ""FUCK"" in the title? RIGHT?! This is one of the best, most important questions you can ask! Basically, because most of the online platforms won\'t allow us to use it... but don\'t worry, it\'s not the name of the MOVIE... it\'s just the name of the Kickstarter campaign. Fri, Mar 18 2016 3:11 pm EDT CAMPAIGN - Are members of the Zappa family involved? This one is really important too. Before she passed, Gail Zappa, and the Zappa Family Trust (ZFT), gave me permission to make this movie, and with it, full access to include ANYTHING in Frank\'s private archives (""the Vault""). But the Zappas do NOT get creative control or approvals over the finished film, which is important to me. Otherwise, it wouldn\'t be an objective doc. It would be a commissioned puff-piece. Fri, Mar 18 2016 3:11 pm EDT CAMPAIGN - Why are you crowdfunding this project? There are a few big reasons, but the biggest are that: (a) I think a lot of Zappa fans will be excited, just like I am, at this chance to peek inside the Vault, and to save/preserve a lot of the historical (but less commercial) stuff Frank saved, and (b) I think Frank would have been totally into crowdfunding, since it lets artists keep a lot more creative freedom. Fri, Mar 18 2016 3:11 pm EDT REWARDS - Will backers see/receive the finished doc before anyone else? Quick answer: that depends on a lot of factors, and I don\'t control all of those. But I WANT backers to see the movie first, even if we do a live online preview screening. I can\'t promise you\'ll get your downloads or DVDs before they go on sale, but I CAN promise I\'d like you to, and I\'ll do my best to make that happen, if it doesn\'t keep us from getting distributed. Fri, Mar 18 2016 3:11 pm EDT THE MOVIE - Aren\'t there a bunch of other Frank Zappa documentaries already? Fri, Mar 18 2016 3:11 pm EDT THE VAULT - If we save the Vault, who owns the stuff in it? Quick answer: whatever we save and digitize from the Vault will still belong to the Zappa Family Trust, but we\'ll have full permission to include ANY of what we find in the final doc, and the companion book, and I\'ll be able to share a bunch of clips and highlights with you as part of the DIGITAL VAULT PASS reward (TRACK 25+). Fri, Mar 18 2016 3:11 pm EDT THE VAULT - Why aren\'t the Zappas saving the Vault on their own? Quick answer: they\'ve been working for decades already to save and release as much material as they can, but it\'s a MUCH bigger job than most people can imagine. It takes a TON of time and money, and by the time they\'re able to get around to all of it (especially the less commercial stuff), it might be too old/damaged to fully restore and preserve. And I don\'t think I\'m the only Zappa fan who likes the idea of helping save more stuff, and getting to see more of what\'s hiding in there, so I think it works out for everyone. Fri, Mar 18 2016 3:11 pm EDT THE VAULT - What happens to the Vault if we don\'t raise enough? Will it all be lost? Quick answer: FUCK NO. The ZFT will continue working to save as much as they can on their own, and will probably continue releasing it on new albums. But we have a chance to save a lot more stuff, right now, and get access to it for the doc, the book, and the Digital Vault Pass. Fri, Mar 18 2016 3:11 pm EDT THE VAULT - How are you going to preserve and archive everything? Is Joe Travers involved? Oh man, such a great question. The quick answer: yes, Joe ""Vaultmeister"" Travers will continue to oversee ALL efforts to preserve and save material from the Vault, but with the funds we raise, we\'ll be able to help him expand and save more... especially some of the really interesting, but less commercial, material about Frank\'s life. I\'ve been learning a ton about the complexities of preserving and archiving, but I\'ll never know as much as Joe. (No one will!) So, I asked him if he could write a little bit about what\'s involved, and he sent me a detailed answer. Fri, Mar 18 2016 3:11 pm EDT BONUS REWARDS - How do I get my ZAPPA FOR PRESIDENT stickers? How will you know I voted? Fri, Mar 18 2016 3:15 pm EDT THE ZAPPAS - Why aren\'t the Zappas paying for this doc themselves?

If you are pledging for a level that doesn\'t already include the TPB editions of TALES OF MR. RHEE Volumes 1 and 2 (such as ""Gimme Everything"" or ""Comics and Coffee"") but want the first two books in the series as well, add $25 to your pledge and, at the end of the campaign, you\'ll be able to add both books to your pledge at a special discounted ""bundle"" price. How\'s that for service? Sun, May 1 2016 11:39 pm EDT Can I add-on an extra Hardcover, T-shirt, mug, etc to my pledge? ABSOLUTELY! If you\'d like to add an extra item to your existing pledge level, just adjust your pledge to include the price for the item you want as per the list below. At the end of the campaign you will get access to a ""BackerKit"" where we\'ll offer backers a chance to choose any additional ""add-ons"" they want that weren\'t part of his/her original pledge. Just make sure to add the funds to your pledge BEFORE the campaign ends, though, as funds added after the campaign ends don\'t count towards the Stretch Goals! Here\'s the guideline for the add-on items: ORIGINAL ART COMMISSION: + $50 (Limit One) WRITE OR WRONG softcover book: + $15 each Mon, May 2 2016 6:19 pm EDT I\'m interested in the ""Convention Royalty"" pledge... but karaoke scares me. And I\'m lactose intolerant. My friends, if you pledge to be ""Convention Royalty"" that means you will be the King/Queen of the Convention for a day (or evening). If you don\'t want to go karaoke after dinner, we won\'t. If you don\'t like ice cream... I\'ll eat yours. (Kidding... mostly.) Pledging at this level gets you a dinner and chat-time that YOU want, so once we determine the convention or signing appearance that works for you (my convention schedule is routinely being updated at www.DirkManning.com and via my mailing list, which you can subscribe to from the front page), we\'ll pick a place to eat and chat about comics, horror movies, heavy metal, wrestling, writing, and whatever else tickles your fancy (within the confines of reason and legality) over a nice meal that will be right for you! Thu, Apr 28 2016 9:45 am EDT I\'m interested in the ""Convention Royalty"" pledge... but are you really serious about the karaoke part? Because that kind of excites me... Am I serious about the karaoke? You watch this video, then you tell me: https://youtu.be/SjR0WCKv7GM Thu, Apr 28 2016 9:47 am EDT I have TALES OF MR. RHEE... but not Volume 2. What\'s the easiest way to add Volume 2 to my pledge? If you want to add TALES OF MR. RHEE Volume 2 (only) to your pledge, just add $15 to your pledge. Then, at the end of the campaign, you\'ll be able to add it to your rewards... meaning you\'re all caught-up just like that! (As mentioned elsewhere in the FAQ, if you want to add TPB editions of TALES OF MR. RHEE Volumes 2 and 3, you can add them both for the special bundled/discount price of $25, because, hey, we\'re happy to help you get it all!) Sun, May 1 2016 11:39 pm EDT Is there a way I can get Hardcover Editions of TALES OF MR. RHEE Volumes 1 and 2? Regarding Volumes 1 and 2 in Hardcover format, the way we run each campaign, each volume of TALES OF MR. RHEE has been offered in Hardcover only once during the initial campaign for 30 days -- and then made print-to-order. Given this, unfortunately, we do not have any hardcover editions of TALES OF MR. RHEE Volume 1 or 2 to offer. That being said, I recognize that some of you out there would really like to jump into the series with ""matching format"" of all three books (so far), and if that\'s the case I\'d recommend grabbing TPB copies of Volumes 1 and 2 through this campaign (or your local comic shop, or Amazon) so you have them to read, and then keeping an eye out in the secondary market (aka: Ebay or Amazon) to see if one turns-up. Honestly, folks, we pretty much print the HC editions to order, so it\'s not even like I have stacks of them squirreled away to send you. If you like having limited edition Hardcovers, though, get the Volume 3 edition while you can through this campaign... because, as evidenced above, once the campaign ends, we print to order and they\'re GONE! Sun, May 1 2016 11:39 pm EDT I enjoy digital comics. Is there a way to get digital copies of TALES OF MR. RHEE Volumes 1 and 2 as well? Absolutely! Just add $10 to your pledge for each additional volume you\'d like, and we\'ll hook you up. That means for $30 total you\'ll get all three volumes of TALES OF MR. RHEE in glorious PDF formats to enjoy on your e-RHEEding device of choice. Thanks for asking... and happy reading! Thu, May 12 2016 12:52 am EDT ?  ']"

According to a Pew Research Center survey from late last year, 40% of people have been harassed online and 73% of people witnessed someone else being harassed online. We know that many folks, from all walks of life, experience and even perpetuate online harassment. However, when it comes to threats, women, people of color, and LGBTQ folks are disproportionately impacted. Of the 3,787 people who reported harassing incidents from 2000 to 2012 to the volunteer organization Working to Halt Online Abuse, 72.5 percent were female. A national study of middle and high school students found that 45 percent of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth who experienced cyber harassment felt depressed and more than 25 percent wrestled with suicidal thoughts. Mon, Apr 20 2015 10:12 am EDT Why is Hollaback! the right fit for taking on online harassment? Hollaback! has ten years of experience addressing sexual harassment in public space through reporting, bystander intervention, and online movement building. As a result of our work, we’ve been awarded the Ted City 2.0 prize, Manhattan Young Democrats “Engendering Progress” award, and been named one of CNN’s Top Safety Apps. We have collected over 8,000 stories of street harassment from individuals all over the world, while providing resources and support. We’re expanding our mission to include online harassment with the launch of HeartMob. In 2014, we took on a leadership role in the online harassment movement by founding, leading and managing an extensive Online Harassment Task Force, including over 70 leaders in the field. During the development of HeartMob, the Online Harassment Task Force served as experts on what victims of online harassment face, and what interventions would help them feel safer and supported online. These suggested interventions formed the core of the HeartMob prototype, which began development in August 2014 and finalized in January 2014. In December 2014, we held the first summit on online harassment in NYC. During the summit, we used human centered design principles to test the HeartMob prototype with key journalists and organizational leaders from the Online Harassment Task Force. Moving forward, we have secured a development team, a legal team, a research team, and we are committed to leveraging Hollaback!’s robust network to make this project successful. Sassafras Tech Collective (http://sassafras.coop) is developing the HeartMob platform and providing necessary updates. They are a worker-owned technology cooperative specializing in web/app design and development for nonprofits. The collective brings expertise from industry, academia, and social justice organizing, alongside extensive professional backgrounds in code and design. Tue, Apr 21 2015 11:47 am EDT How will you make the platform secure for users? We take the security and privacy of Heartmobbers very seriously. The last thing we want is for someone to be harassed as a result of using HeartMob. As a result, HeartMob will implement social and technical security best practices. These practices will include: Mon, Apr 27 2015 11:41 am EDT What will you do if you raise over $10,000 on the project? $10,000 covers initial tech development on the HeartMob platform -- but we have a long way to go. Any additional funding will go into further development of the platform. We will provide updates throughout the campaign and strive for transparency. Mon, Apr 20 2015 10:12 am EDT Is my donation tax-deductible? Yes. Hollaback! is a 501(c)3 organization. Mon, Apr 20 2015 10:12 am EDT Where can I find more information about Hollaback!?

310,1310,"["" How Does Kickstarter Work? Kickstarter is a new way to fund creative ideas and ambitious endeavors. Kickstarter is powered by a unique all-or-nothing funding method where projects must be fully funded or no money changes hands. If funding fails, all pledges are canceled and that's that. Your card is not charged. Once I reach my goal and the project finishes I’ll get to work on your rewards. Mon, Jun 8 2015 3:04 pm EDT How Do I Make a Pledge? Just click the green “Back This Project” button in the upper right-hand corner. You will be asked to input your pledge amount and select a reward. From there, you will go through the checkout process. It’s fast and simple. Mon, Jun 8 2015 3:11 pm EDT Can You Exceed Your Campaign Goal? Yes, and it would be so awesome to do so! I have listed here a bare necessity budget. I am starting with $5,500 on Kickstarter because I think with the all-or-nothing approach I can raise that amount. But, honestly, I have chosen this platform to pre-sale the album as I want to spread the word about this music as far and wide as possible so people will be listening to it! Mon, Jun 8 2015 3:11 pm EDT Can I Increase My Pledge Once It’s Been Made? YES! Once you donate to my campaign, you may want to change your incentive reward to a different one, or increase your pledge amount. To do so, go to Kickstarter and sign in. If you go to my campaign page, the green “Back This Project” button has been replaced with a blue “Manage Your Donation” button. Click it and you can enter a new amount, or choose a new incentive. Mon, Jun 8 2015 3:11 pm EDT Want to Help but Can’t Donate?

That being said I have some Japanese paper prints which I hang on my wall bare so it’s not necessary. Tue, Jan 23 2018 7:30 pm EST Tell me more about this handmade paper? Traditional Japanese paper–known as Washi–is made from the fibres of plants. It has some interesting properties. It’s light, strong and feels a bit like cloth. Kozo paper is made from the inner layers of the mulberry bush. The branches of the bush are trimmed, cleaned and stretched and are then pounded into a paste. After that, the paste is laid out flat in thin sheets and dried. There’s a lot more to the process.

Unfortunately, due to restrictions, we may not be able to add extra people to some perk levels, so always contact us first! Wed, Oct 11 2017 3:23 pm EDT Will I get stickers if I buy RJ's Meats or Coffee and I am not coming to the event? We had limited quantities of the ever so lovingly crafted meats and coffee perks so we couldn't include one for every backer.  We added them as standalone perks that can potentially be shipped out.  If you order one and aren't coming to Lexington we will send you some stickers too.  We also expect to see some salami and coffee bean selfies sent our way too.

474,1474,"[' Aren’t there already a lot of books about album cover art on the market? Yes, there are. I have several dozen of them in my collection, and I list more of them on the ACHOF site. A lot of time has been spent cataloging album cover art, but very little time has been spent introducing the people that made it and letting you learn more about them, their careers, their inspirations, etc. Thu, Apr 5 2018 11:59 am EDT Why are you turning to crowd-funding for this project? There are a few reasons, but the biggest are that: (a) I think a lot of album cover art fans will be excited to read the stories both about some of their favorite album covers and the people that made them and (b) I thought this might be a great opportunity to offer some of the many prints I saved from my gallery as incentives to fans and collectors of album art (it seemed a shame that they were just sitting in archive boxes, rather than hung up on the walls of album art fans). Since I owned them outright and bought them a number of years ago, I am also able to offer them at less-than-market prices – all the more incentive to support this project, I think! Thu, Apr 5 2018 11:59 am EDT When will the rewards be shipped out? Of course, like all crowd-funding campaigns, the schedule can perhaps change. Of course, since I’ve already completed 90% of the writing and editing and have the art prints in stock, I’m feeling pretty confident that I’ll be able to ship out the art print rewards soon after the project is funded, with the book following in a few months (gunning for an August, 2018 ship date – in plenty of time for Holiday gift-giving, if that’s your hope). While I can\'t promise what\'ll happen exactly,what I  CAN promise is that we\'ll work hard to tell you ASAP if/when anything changes. And you\'ll always be able to find our most current estimates via the link to the ACHOF Rewards page - https://wp.me/P15kTT-wW Thu, Apr 5 2018 11:59 am EDT About those shipping charges… I\'m doing my best to keep these reasonable and to a minimum for you. The book will weigh nearly 4lbs. and measure at least 9"" square, so it should fit into some of the standard mailing envelopes and boxes I\'ve used. I prefer to use the USPS for shipping as they offer both package tracking and insurance - very helpful on shipments both here in the U.S. and overseas. Overseas customers - I have to apologize in advance for the added costs for shipping. They\'ve gone up rather dramatically over the past couple of years, and there aren\'t as many options as there used to be, so I can only hope that it doesn\'t dissuade you from supporting me at this point. If you\'re supporting me at the higher levels, please note that your prints and books will be shipped separately in packaging that will keep your products safe. These cost a bit more, but they\'re worth it - trust me, after shipping thousands of prints to customers around the world when I had my gallery, I\'ve learned (the hard way) that careful package prep and quality containers are the ONLY way to ship to customers - at least those you want to keep happy! Thu, Apr 5 2018 11:59 am EDT Will Kickstarter supporters be the first to get this book? I chose to offer the first edition of my book to my Kickstarter supporters as I felt that a crowd-funding project would be the best way to both get me focused on (finally) writing and producing this book and offer my long-time supporters something special. I’ve written and collected so much content – over 1000 pages so far – that I could offer an even bigger/more-comprehensive book, but I didn’t want to produce such an enormous book – and sell it at an exorbitant price – so I’m choosing what I feel is a great deal of compelling content and, if the first edition is successful, I’d hope to bring out either/both a second book with more stories and/or that 1000+ page compendium later on. Of course, it goes without saying that I’m hoping to offer a version of this book to publishers who might want to publish it in a more “traditional” way, but I’ll entertain that if/when those offers appear AFTER the first “collector’s edition” is printed and shipped to supporters.

It accounts for the conference call tool, a technician to run the calls,  equipment costs, editing, some panelist expenses, and some production. It also allows me to pay myself an hourly rate for time spent producing the series. Sun, Jul 23 2017 1:33 pm EDT What is Factual Democracy Project? How is it different from Ctrl Alt Right Delete? Factual Democracy is an entity I’ve created to offer more digital content beyond the newsletter. It will house Ctrl Alt Right Delete, the speaker series, and down the line additional content. Sun, Jul 23 2017 1:33 pm EDT Why are you doing a series of calls? Why not a podcast? With support from MisinfoCon Jennifer Fiore and I put together a conference call on the French Election in May. I loved the format, and the reader feedback indicated that participants did too. It gives participants an opportunity to ask questions. I also love the experience of doing an event live. Sun, Jul 23 2017 1:33 pm EDT Why are the rewards memberships? What if I just want a coffee cup or a t-shirt? I considered swag rewards, but I wanted to spend my time producing the series, not fulfilling orders. Membership is something I’ve long wanted to offer readers, and I know from surveying them that they’re interested too. Crowdfunding a specific project seemed like the best way to launch a membership program. Sun, Jul 23 2017 1:33 pm EDT Why do you use the term ""alt-right?"" Doesn\'t that legitimize white supremacists or soften their image? This is the question I\'ve received most often from people who don\'t read my newsletter. I use the term alt-right when I\'m talking to people about what I do for the first time because it\'s a term they\'re at least somewhat familiar with. My goal is to help people understand what the so-called alt-right is, who they\'re aligned with, how ugly their beliefs are, and why they\'re a dangerous political and cultural force. I try to avoid using the term in my newsletter. I\'ll often refer to them as the so-called alt-right or the Frog Squad. And I don\'t sugarcoat their white supremacist and misogynist beliefs for a second, I want people to understand what we\'re up against. Sat, Jul 29 2017 12:20 pm EDT ?  ']"

BONUS PRINT NUMBERING DETAILS (FIRST RELEASE ONLY) A couple of days ago I posted a 'pending' explanation on how the numbering will work on the Bonus Prints. I'm pleased to say that we've got it figured out now and this is how it will be done (in addition to the gold foil seal). There will be two sets of numbering: Bonus Print Numbering - Dave will hand letter a sequence number of your FIRST RELEASE Bonus Plates that will numbered as 1 of x, 2 of x, 3 of x, etc all the way up to x of x (Calculus anyone??) where the variable x will be replaced with the total number of Bonus Prints of that particular version produced. So, for example, if 24 backers selected BP #4 then x = 24 for BP #4. Similarly, if 35 backers selected BP #9, then x= 35 and so on. Each BP will have it's own 'x' value. If you pledged for a Headsketch in CANO, this will be done in a similar way, except for Dave hand lettering the numbers this time. Portfolio Numbering - This will be your reservation number (which becomes a registration number once printed) out of y where y = total number of portfolios printed (just like the __ of 300 we did for CANO). This connects your Bonus Prints to your portfolio number and the master registration number record will show this. Signature - Dave will sign every Bonus Print John Funk Sat, Oct 25 2014 7:30 pm EDT ?  ""]"
