I started out wrapping stones in twisted wires for people that I liked. people would occasionally offer to buy my work, but I've never been much of a salesman. over the years I have learned to solder, set stones, craft rivets, and all manner of other techniques. I have invested in what tools I have been able to along the way, but as my skills have broadened, so has my need for the larger, and more expensive tool-sets (Centrifugal casting machine, wet grinder, drill press, bench roller...) well, the list is honestly endless. And the cost of nice stones, and metal media is rather astronomical! What I am asking for is a boost to fund my art. I give half my pieces away to people who are nice, or as gifts. and the other half I either sell cheap, or sit around like hidden treasures :-] I'm not out to necessarily get rich, so much as to enrich the world with off the wall awesome metal things :-] "

Regardless of the success of this Kickstarter campaign, SHRIEKS AND SHIVERS FROM THE HORROR ZINE will be released in trade paperback and eBook format on January 6, 2015. 
So, then why are we asking for money? We want to move this project beyond the ""normal"" small press anthology. The majority of funds from this campaign will be funneled back to the emerging authors included in the project. What's an emerging author? They're the authors you may not have heard of yet, but we suspect you will hear of them in the not so distant future. 
The goal here is small, only $2500, much smaller than most anthologies on Kickstarter. The reason behind this is to set obtainable stretch goals. For every $500 over the $2,500 goal, the emerging authors will each receive an additional payment for their stories. This means the sky's the limit!

How will the money be spent? 
This pie chart is based on an estimate of rewards, but it shows how the majority of the funds raised will go back to the authors. 
Special to this campaign is a LIMITED EDITION hardback version of SHRIEKS AND SHIVERS FROM THE HORROR ZINE.  Yes, you read that right, a HARDBACK! "

7,15031726,"When it comes to buying course material, students have two essential problems: 
Complexity and Price.  
The world has long understood the price problem, but the complexity problem is less understood, and it directly affects the price problem.  You see, if students don't know all their options, or don't understand what they actually need (or don't need), they're going to pay too much.
PageLess solves the complexity problem, which solves the price problem.
When a student uses PageLess to search for course material, PageLess doesn't focus on the item they searched. It focuses on the CONTENT they need.  This may sound like a minor difference, but there's nothing minor about the savings it creates.
 PageLess isn't a textbook comparison site.  
Yeah, we compare prices as well as anyone, but it's the most boring thing we do. PageLess is a textbook search engine that guides students through the buying process so they only buy what they need.  Other search engines return results for a single item.  PageLess returns results for EVERY item with the same content.
And PageLess doesn't sell anything.  After we work our fancy textbook magic and give students all their options, PageLess sends them to the websites they already know and trust to complete their purchases.  Incidentally, PageLess makes a small commission when students use our links, which will allow us to make PageLess sustainable. 
Our website is programmed in Angular, a state-of-the-art programming language that creates a wildly pleasing user experience. Our design and branding is as futuristic as the service we offer.  We have a world class software developer on staff and are contracting with other professionals to help us program, design, and market PageLess once it's completed.
""Ok, great.  But how does it work?""
So glad you asked.
We tried to make PageLess intuitive and self-explanatory when using it, but since you are reading a Kickstarter and not using our site, let's break it down.
In the screenshot below, the student searched for a looseleaf book (a book with no binding.)  They probably thought the looseleaf was going to be cheaper.  It isn't. PageLess connected the looseleaf ISBN they searched to every format available. It's going to save this student a lot of money.  It’s also going to get them a nicer book for class.
The higher quality bound version of the book is about half price. Rent it instantly in the digital format if you need it fast.
Other comparison sites would have only compared the price of the looseleaf book and maybe the eBook.  With PageLess, we compare 6 options, and some are much cheaper. 
But here's PageLess' most powerful capability.
In the example below,  PageLess does what no other textbook search engine can fully do. It identifies the FORMAT of every searched item and links it together with every other format that has the same content!  In our example, PageLess instantly knows that the item searched is a textbook package, specifically an access code package that consists of two items: a printed book and a one-time use printed access code.  
PageLess knows that the item searched comes with an access code.
Let's say the student clicks ""yes"" because they need the access code.  They will then see this:
PageLess knows what content is contained in every search.
And here's the results page.  Note: the student has the option to add a print book if they wish, or to just buy the package they originally searched, but we don't suggest doing that, as it's going to cost him or her a lot more money.  Before PageLess, this student had a single option--to purchase the full package for over $100.
PageLess knows the access code already comes with an eBook, so save money and just buy the code.
But what if you don't need that access code? It's fairly common to not need it. Choose ""No, I don't need the code"" and you will see this:
Don't need the code, then don't buy on the package page!
PageLess directs those students who don't need the code to just buy the book (which is a different format), and then offers them that book's CONTENT in every format available. Check it out:
If you don't need the code, just buy the book, but NOT on the package page.
PageLess does so much more than these two examples.  I could go on...but you may have noticed that we're already going a bit long here.
So, why do we need your money?
Students need your help, especially during this pandemic, to find the content they need at the lowest price possible, and they have to be able to do it remotely.
We'll use the money we raise to complete the technical work on our site, which is mainly research and development, working out bugs, testing, and data entry. PageLess' complexity is mind-boggling, and our developers informed us that they only work if we pay them.  
 If we exceed our goal, we'll use the money to save students even more.
Every cent earned over $4500.00 will go toward helping students save money.  We have lots of ideas for new functionality and for integrating formats that publishers are just creating.
Check out our rewards.  
A  Zoom session or presentation will make you a PageLess expert.  Once you're an expert you can spread the word and teach your friends or colleagues.  You'll pretty much be a hero.
Oh, and consider grabbing one of our environmentally friendly and beautifully branded aluminum or stainless steel water bottles.

Students need PageLess NOW.
PageLess was always going to help students, but there has never been a better time for it to launch than now.  Because of the pandemic, millions of students find themselves going to school online for the first time.  They have no bookstores.  They have no on-campus help to find their course material.  With your help, PageLess can stand in the gap and help students source the CONTENT they need for less. 
Make a pledge.  Share this campaign with anyone you know who is a student or who has students in their lives.  Post it on social media.  Together we can help make college affordable for all."
8,1601968864,"As an answer to the spontaneous and complex web of global maritime regulations related to environmental compliance, the idea for a centralized source of information, formatted and ready for use was born. Below is a consolidated version of the whitepaper research on the original concept which will be finalized in this project as we expand the scope to the general public.  
The     Maritime Environmental Hub
Forming a unified     central database for marine environmental shipping regulations and the     associated framework linking those with a role in creating, managing or     providing information. Regulation Facilitation.
7/22/2018
Overview
The goal has been defined as a centralized database of marine environmental relating to the massive maritime industry comprising of over 90,000 vessels worldwide. (1) An industry spread globally along several sectors all of which have an impact in their own respective ways. Ranging from governance on an international level of nearly 200 countries, to regional maritime authorities, to flag states, down to the local port limits, the industry is regulated on how it may impact the environment with solid enforcement across the board.  In addition to the policies set out aimed directly at the shipping industry, regional environmental agencies not only have the power to but are dedicated to protecting the marine environment by creating protected areas with their own specific limits of use. To this day the details of these policies and how they impact the shipping industry remains with the policy makers and the facilitation of this information must take several paths to reach the proper destination. The time and effort needed to obtain this information can be daunting, and in many cases it goes missing. The solution is access to a one stop shop for marine environmental shipping regulations. Creating the means to obtain this information, centralize it and easily facilitate it to those who need it most. The goal is to reduce unlawful operations, accidental discharges and protect the marine environment.
Background
Ship Operation
In the shipping industry, on a daily basis ships of all types and sizes transit many different areas of the oceans and the seas. These ships depend upon discharging and eliminating all types of waste from their vessel in order to operate at a safe and sanitary level. Although this discharging is essential for normal ship process, these are pollutants that have an effect on the environment. It is the job of several types of government bodies to regulate these pollutants from vessel to minimize the impact. Almost all ships must abide by these regulations which are and will be in the coming years constantly progressing. Each shipping company has set up company regulations in which their ships must follow in order to avoid heavy fines and penalties from violating the laws and regulations set forth.
It is the duty and the combined effort for several officers onboard each ship to maintain a level of conciseness towards these sometimes strict regulations. It is necessary for shipboard safety to follow these discharge regulations in a very essential manner. It is also essential for the company itself to ensure its vessels remain in compliance as many violations create large to very large fines for the company. With this being said, since the research for these regulations is mostly done manually, there is considerable room for error as well as the possibility of missing critical information. Both can have severe consequences for the vessel and company. In order for a vessel to ensure they are in compliance they must rely on many factors. These include information from company management, communications with local agents, and research within given publications and reference materials. Normally local agencies were depended upon and fully relied upon by shipping companies as having the most accurate and detailed information. As the industry has progressed and regulations advance, companies are more and more reluctant to rely on local agents. This is mostly in part due to instances resulting from a lack of diligence by the local agents, especially in non developed regions. If regulations are compiled onboard a vessel it is down to the ship’s crew to maintain and manage how to store this information. The task of staying compliant is becoming more and more complex given the ever changing regulations, the various crew members rotating onboard, and the expansion of itineraries. Once all regulations are set, there also becomes the need to ensure the vessel follows all regulations on operations down to the minute and mile. Daily meetings are usually in place to discuss such requirements and operations, yet human error can still remain an issue.
Policy Creation and Implementation
In order to have the greatest effect on minimizing environmental impact, policies regarding restrictions for the maritime industry start on an international level and continue down as local as specific port limit regulations. On the top of international policy sits the International Maritime Organization (IMO), and subsequently the Marine Environmental Protection Committee (MEPC), the committee of the IMO responsible for the creation of international standards for the prevention of pollution from ships. These regulations form MARPOL 73/78; The international Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships. There are 159 signatories of MARPOL which have representation on the MEPC who meet annually to develop and agree upon these standards. (2) It is the responsibility of the Flag states to ensure their specific requirements cover everything implemented under MARPOL. The policies stated in MARPOL are generally recognized and enforced worldwide as it is the main international convention covering prevention of pollution from ships. These regulations come with the highest consequences of non-compliance, though most are well known and clearly outlined within six MARPOL annexes, each dedicated to a particular type of pollution.
Annex
Description
Annex I
Regulations for the   Prevention of Pollution by Oil
Annex II
Regulations for the control of Pollution by Noxious Liquid Substances   (NLS)
Annex III
Regulations for the prevention of Pollution by harmful substances in   packaged form
Annex IV
Regulations for the prevention of Pollution by Sewage from ships
Annex V
Regulations for the prevention of Pollution by Garbage from ships
Annex VI
Regulations for the prevention of Air Pollution from ships
During each annual MEPC meeting many changes are discussed and many new regulations are set to come into force within the following year. The regulations set out in MARPOL are generally the most generic and developed with the entire industry in mind. This prevents the IMO from designating many specific areas for protection and leaves this for local and regional agencies.
Regional agencies cover large areas or state areas for development and enforcement of environmental regulations. These are usually government bodies specific to either a country or a group of countries under a union such as the European Union. Examples of these agencies include the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from the USA, European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), and the China Maritime Safety Administration (CMSA). Consequently a particular territory may have additional authorities setting out their own set of rules and regulations such as the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the USA. In addition to these organizations dedicated to environment and maritime areas, most nations or regions have health sectors of government which regulate certain aspects of vessel operations as well. For instance in the United States, there is the United States Public Health (USPH), and in Brazil, ANVISA. Both of which restrict certain discharges into the seas under their authority. Using the United States as an example of how multiple agencies work by taking into account the EPA, NOAA and the USPH. The EPA develops discharge restrictions and criteria under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) for all vessels within United States waters extending to 3 nautical miles from shore, including wastewater. The USPH requires vessels to change the water in recreational water facilities (RWF) such as swimming pools, but does not allow their discharge within 12 nautical miles from land. Furthermore NOAA designates and manages marine protected areas (MPA) such as National Marine Sanctuaries which contain their own set of environmental regulations. Luckily in the United States the National Marine Protected Areas Center, the governing body which designates MPAs, is a sector of a larger administration which also manages maritime shipping activity (NOAA) and works closely with the US Maritime Administration (MARAD). Unfortunately this is not standard around the world and many protected areas are put into force without detailed consideration on the affects to the maritime or shipping industry. This leaves some room for interpretation. This interpretation usually ends up lying with the management of shipping companies and flag state administrations.
Each and every vessel must be registered to a particular flag state, however not all vessels are flagged under the same country as the vessel owners. The main purpose of a flag state administration is to ensure that all vessels flying their flag are in compliance with international conventions and standards. This includes safety, certification and pollution prevention. The flag state also enforces additional policies for its vessels to comply with the laws of the flag state as well. A United States flagged vessel will need to comply with international regulations as well as U.S. shipping regulations regardless the vessel’s location at any time. Flag states are responsible to the IMO and have their own set of regulations regarding the monitoring and inspection of international standards. Many flag states issue notices and circulars to the shipping companies flying their flag in an attempt to maintain compliance throughout their fleets. Although the main goal of a flag state is to maintain compliance on an international level, when violations on a local level are possible, the flag state is expected to react. It becomes a perpetual burden for organizations such as flag states and shipping companies to keep its vessels up to date with anything more than the most general international regulation.
The lower end tiers such as sub-regional (US State), and port specific regulations cover the smallest area although usually come with the tightest restrictions. Each particular Port Authority may impose their own environmental regulation in response to additional protection needed on a local level. State regulations in the US may also include specific restrictions within state waters and are governed by the state itself.  None of these would undermine international, regional or state regulations, rather add another layer to the accumulation.
Although nearly 97% of the world’s oceans are free from protection, there are almost 15,000 marine protected areas throughout the globe. (3) These protected areas come in various shapes, sizes and levels of protection. The main goal of conservation is clear, but unfortunately some of these areas do not have specific clear guidelines on how they affect the operation of passing ships. Likewise if they do have guidelines, they are not well known and usually don’t come into play until a violation has occurred. This again leaves a heavy burden on shipping companies and vessel officers in determining how to manage their operations. Additionally most MPAs are not designated on nautical charts to notify mariners of their location. This leads to common errors of compliance and unfortunately goes mostly unnoticed. Regardless of the designating authority all protected areas are compiled on an international level under UNEP in the WDPA. With so much of the open ocean which falls under no particular jurisdiction (60%), the UN are taking steps towards protecting this region under a high-seas biodiversity treaty. This treaty will delegate the steps for designation, monitoring, and enforcement of marine protected areas on the high seas. Facilitation of this information is key, especially to those crossing oceans, operating commercial vessels, and calling the sea home.
Under the tiers of the regulatory pyramid fall shipping company specific policy. Company policy normally goes above and beyond regulations set out by international, flag state and regional standards. This ensures smooth operations of vessels covering most ports and areas around the world. Although this may seem a particularly simple task, there is a need for intense and constant collaboration due to two major factors. The first is the ever changing industry and the consistency of regulations requires constant collaboration. The second factor is related to the effect these regulations have on shipboard operations. In general limiting shipboard operations can be critical to the safety, efficiency, timing and overall success of a vessels voyage. Determining a clear and distinct line between protecting the environment and limiting shipboard operations is of the upmost importance for any shipping company. In short, by doing too little a company faces fines, a bad reputation and a degree of certainty that will not allow them to compete in the future as regulations advance. By doing too much, the company faces expensive overhead costs, increased time constraints, overall risk to voyage efficiency, and the need of additional resources for management. Regardless of the company policy, the shipping companies themselves are also the first level of enforcement for any regulation no matter the designation level.
Policy Enforcement
Generally the enforcement aspect falls into different hands than those who develop environmental regulations. This remains constant down to sub-regional/port levels where as mentioned previously, the lowest tiers of sub-regional agencies and local port authorities have sufficient means of inspection and enforcement. Likewise public health agencies mostly carry out their own inspections as well. At the regional and international level, most policies are enforced through coast guard agencies or similar means such as port state control (PSC). Port state control inspections are carried out under the Paris MOU, an international agreement providing the means for foreign vessels to be inspected by PSC officials. PSC officials maintain the right to inspect vessels under certain criteria although it’s important to note that the responsibility of maintaining safe and compliant operation lies with ship owners and flag states. (4) In order to ensure that ship owners are maintaining a level of compliance across the board, regular company audits are carried out.  As mentioned previously, the objective of the flag state is to ensure a vessel’s compliance with international standards. This can be done through the use of a classification society which in turn carries out the vessel inspections. A classification society is a non-governmental organization which is authorized to carry out vessel inspections in order to prove compliance ranging from flag state regulations to insurance policy requirements. Each and every vessel falls under a classification society or class, which certifies the equipment onboard, the vessels construction, and the vessels operations among others.
Abstract
The Environmental Compliance Assistance Platform or ECAP for short is a software system installed on a vessel’s navigation bridge to help plan and monitor the vessel’s environmental operations. The ECAP uses electronic navigation charts and calculates the vessels position in relation to regulated areas. The operational aspect of the ECAP system alone is useful for ship’s crew although at its core is the requirement to provide various levels of environmental regulations and their respective boundaries. Distance calculations and alarm functions alone assist in the normal operation of the vessel, although without the core database the ECAP unit is operating at limited capacity. The ECAP unit is the means of passing the vital regulatory information directly into the bitter end users. In order to complete this objective, the database must be built. The data will come from several sources among various levels of management and designation. This will ensure the most comprehensive environmental compliance tool possible. Regulatory bodies create the rules, the operators must follow the rules, and everything in-between needs a smooth channel for efficient use. The concept of how to get the information from the database to the end users and effectively use it is solved with the ECAP. The concept of how to obtain the information from those who create it into the database is the concept of the Maritime Environmental Hub (MEH).  The MEH is the platform for which policy makers and regulatory bodies can provide the details of the regulations under their responsibility. The MEH is designed for ease of use for not only end users but for the individuals which will be updating and adding information. The Maritime Environmental Hub project is characterized by a unique environmental governance system for capacity building and knowledge sharing. It acts as a bridge between national, regional and local governments and facilitates interaction between key international organizations, port planners and developers, policy makers, the private sector and citizens. Local and regional governments will earn recognition for their achievements while also contributing to and benefiting from the exchange and dissemination of best practices for environmental protection and sustainable development at local and regional level.

Benefits
The maritime industry is filled with a maze of regulations all of which must be adhered to not only to realistically conserve the marine environment but also promote a positive reputation and avoid costly violations. Looking even further past the benefits for the end users and the companies utilizing the information, policy makers and regulators have the opportunity to explore how they relate to the industry. Each user no matter the level of access will have the ability to compare different regions. This will ideally lead to the spread of useful and effective ideas across the board. No one region is exactly the same as another, though similar measures can be taken to promote the conservation of the marine environment and regulate those operations or activities which may have highest impact. Access to the information is a concept and the spreading of ideas is inevitable when this is achieved.
Image and publicity is high priority and must include environmental friendly operations. It is obvious to say any publicity outlining a negative environmental impact from a shipping company can be disastrous. Furthermore the statistic shows that 60-80 % of cruise passengers are ready to pay more if they are sure that the cruise company is environmental friendly. Even cargo companies are forced to present promotion of environment conservation due to the ever growing ability of consumers to track their goods.
Violations throughout the world can be severely costly to shipping companies and have undesirable effects on not only crew but company managers and employees. Under the US Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS), a vessel which is found to violate the regulations set forth are subject to fines upwards of $1,000,000. Additionally within the United States unauthorized pollution by a ship in marine protected areas can have fines of $100,000 per violation, per day. (5)

The Future
The concept of the Maritime Environmental Hub is not a fixed or set with a permanent finish line. As the industry grows with time, the regulations that control the operations within will always advance with it. This creates the opportunity to leave an open-ended condition for the MEH not only allowing the updating and supplementing of information but making these an essential part of the success moving forward. All in all, an updated MEH will produce the most comprehensive environmental compliance database for the industry. The MEH will serve as a template for what can be done and hopefully lead to additional hubs dealing with other complex streams of the undeniably fundamental information the industry relies on.

I have no space for anything else! This gave me the idea to try to build an art studio so that I can continue to create more works of art that everyone can love and appreciate. Without my own space, I will have a hard time creating beautiful works of art. Especially some of my bigger pieces, I need a lot of room to work on those, and my living room just isn't cutting it!

10,906477612,"Theatre Forever's The Nature Crown is a wild and imaginative new piece of theater conceived and directed by Jon Ferguson - created with the ensemble with text by Dominic Orlando. The Nature Crown will make its world premier in the Guthrie Theater's Dowling Studio, running March 21 through April 5, 2015.
The Nature Crown is told through the eyes of a stranger who, at a crossroads in his life, finds himself jolted from his reality and lost in the woods. With only a broken briefcase and a sad potted plant, he finds - at the center of it all - a village within his own heart. 
Highly physical, comic and poetic, The Nature Crown will bring Theatre Forever's special brand of playful, irreverent and imaginative new work to the Guthrie Theater. It features some of the Twin Cities most exciting actors, musicians and theater-makers. 
By contributing to this campaign you will be supporting the artists / theatre-makers dedicating their time and artistry to the creation of this deeply moving and thought provoking performance piece – a new work that explores origin, innocence, community and change. 
The Nature Crown is set in a village. The creation of a village demands a large cast and creative team of performers, musicians and designers; 26 in total. All donations raised through this campaign will go directly toward paying these collaborators for their time, their commitment and their artistry. Your generosity means the world to us. 
THANK YOU!
Love Forever, 
Theatre Forever

All you need is to be connected to the internet and about 14 cents a day to subscribe to the service.  For registered users in poor and war-ravaged countries, Accompany will be available for free.   ""Music accompanies peace"" is my motto.  (See the article below that came out about Accompany in Yahoo Finance). http://finance.yahoo.com/news/music-accompanies-peace-violinist-creates-150000122.html?soc_src=mediacontentstory&soc_trk=fb
ACCOMPANY - why?
I'm a music teacher and a classical violinist and pianist by training. I've always felt there was a need in the market for a niche app which classical musicians could use as a practice tool to play along with during sessions.  From the onset, the idea behind my app's content was that it wouldn't be metronomic or robotic ""karaoke"" versions of the music. Nor would my music be limited to just one tempo like accompaniment recordings. And unlike other apps which require training and are expensive since they charge per piece, mine would be instantly intuitive, it would be inexpensive and it would feature beautiful and professionally recorded accompaniment for the whole repertoire. Everything - sonatas, concertos, short pieces, etudes, drones, scales, and different instruments would be available in one place, for just a few pennies a day - basically enough to keep the product up and running.
ACCOMPANY features a nice and easy-to-use design, heavily inspired by the work of industrial designer Dieter Rams, who worked for Braun and who heavily influenced Apple's designs. 
Accompany coding is bullet-proof. The sound quality is amazing. The app is super easy to use. And I've purposefully kept the subscription cost really low so that a music student in any country or economy can easily afford to use my product. (Subscription cost breaks down to literally pennies a day). Need to practice that Beethoven Sonata at 3am right before your jury or recital? No problem.  Want to learn how to hear better so you play better in tune?  Got it.  Wanna practice violin, cello, flute, voice, etc., music all at the same cost?  On it.  Coming very soon.
So far I've scraped together my life savings, sold my possessions on eBay, and saved all the money I possibly could.  My income as a local music teacher is limited.  My family thinks I'm crazy. Yet, I have a passionate belief that I am creating a worthwhile app for music students, and it's only going to get better with time.  
I’ve received many positive comments and encouragement from noted violinists and teachers like virtuoso James Ehnes and professor Kurt Sassmannshaus. Other well known online pedagogues like Beth Blackerby (violinlab.com) and Lora Staples (www.reddesertviolin.com) have also been heartwarmingly generous in their enthusiastic support.  
Let's work together to make this a success story. I've already been offered an article in a major industry magazine and I've got contacts on Facebook and throughout the classical music world.
Here's specifically what more money is needed for, either from my own income, or from the generous support of my supporters:
1. Hiring advanced students and professionals to record more repertoire not just for violin but for different instruments and voice.  I have an old MacBook pro I use - it would eventually be nice to upgrade the memory and processor.
2. Paying for things like continued programming and site development and maintenance (expensive).  I don't do programming - I have to hire professionals who know what they're doing or the result would be disastrous.
3. Advertising and marketing (very expensive).  You can have a cool app but if nobody knows you exist...exactly.
4. Instant noodles are not free and often needed past midnight.
So, every bit helps.  10 bucks helps.  50 bucks helps more!
Thanks for your interest and support.

13,1179056219,"Hi! I'm Victoria and I am currently a senior at UNO studying fine arts. I've always loved drawing and making things so when I realized I could do that for a living I jumped at the chance. The only thing better than making art is sharing it with others! But of course to do that it will cost money, thus this Kickstarter. After much consideration I decided the perfect place to start would be with Humphrey. From the moment I started him until the moment I finished I genuinely loved drawing him. With encouraging words from my friends I knew that I had to make Humphrey available to anyone who would want him!
The Humphrey pin will be 1.25 inches tall and will include Humphrey along with his gradient background. All proceeds from the pin will go right back into the business so I can make even more wonderful pins in the future and hopefully expand out more to projects such as prints and even stickers!
This is honestly a dream come true for me, to be able to make art that I love and then share it with the world. Any money you can spare is so very appreciated and I can't do anything without the support from others.
Thank you so much and I hope you love my work as much as I do!

15,287419192,"What this Kickstarter Offers!
One Blog theme, written in enterprise level Angular.  An Angular version fo the Food Advisor application, under the general Strapi Github space. [Food Advisor Github can be seen here and current live Food Advisor application can be seen here.] Lastly, we will enhance documentation for the Food Advisor repo + take ownership for the front end open source side of Strapi
Why Did This Kickstarter Happen?!
Many people love Strapi as a CMS, as it is an open source headless CMS, that you get to self host. Server integration with Strapi is really well documented too. However, those coming from a Wordpress, or similar background, which is all of us, are missing out on the theming abilities. That is, being able to buy a theme, and plug and play into Strapi. That is where the inspiration for this Kickstarter came from, and why it is happening. 
What Happens When Kickstarter Officially Get's Funded?
30 days after the Kickstarter is officially funded, we will have ready to deliver an Enterprise Level, Open Source, Blog Theme for Strapi (It will be written in Angular). Complete documentation can be expected for the theme. All the way from changing icons, to how to run unit, and end to end tests. 
45 days after the Kickstarter is complete, we will have created the equivalent Food Advisor Angular equivalent, as well as improve documentation for the Strapi Food Advisor Github repo. Razroo will also create 50 different business use cases for which Strapi might be ideal, and the ideal front end framework to use with Strapi, in those 50 different use cases(storefront, blog, project management, dynamic business CMS etc.).
60 days after we will begin taking ownership of the open source front end side for Strapi. This means we will be putting out a poll on Twitter for the next framework to be built out to. This means building out already built Blog Theme from Angular, and moving to React, Vue, Svelte etc. next. The highest voted framework wins.
90 days after we will deliver the same blog theme, in the next framework(,or lack thereof). It will be open sourced, ready to go. 
At this point, we are well on our way for creating a Blog Theme for all frameworks. Razroo will continue to take ownership of open source, and continue building out the Blog Theme to different frameworks. 
Any contributions are more than appreciated, and we are definitely looking forward to creating themes that will make your life easier, and decrease the amount of time it takes you to develop your next project. Thank you.
Note: This money will be going to Razroo, and not to Strapi, to build this open source application for the benefit of Strapi, and the general Strapi Ecosystem. We are working closely with Strapi team, to make sure this benefits the community as much as possible, in as intuitive as a fashion as possible. "

17,823851495,"We are three IT professionals, who would like to give back to creative community in small non-profit organizations by buying selective products from them, doing value addition and sell through our website, Giftganga.com. Specifically, we would like to reach out to smaller organizations who do not have means or expertise to market.
These are unique giftable items that you may not have received or given yet! A three-fold gift:
a gift of giving - for yourself when you buy the product,
a gift of inspiration - to the person receiving the gift, and,
a gift of self-reliance - to remote underprivileged artisans
Gifts Ganga...
Once we identify the product, and decide on the value additions, we do the required work in Virginia, US. We see the value in continuing such creative effort and building such a portal. Funding is needed for buying such products, design and fabricate the value addition and bring them to larger market.
Artisans
Silk thread embroidered cards and banana bark artworks are made by residents of Anandwan. Anandwan is a community rehabilitation center for leprosy patients and the disabled, founded by social activist Late Baba Amte in India. These artisans gain a sense of dignity and self-reliance through the sales of these items.
Custom Frame Of a Unique Design
Above banana bark artwork is made by them as well.. however it is not offered as part of this project at this time.  In fact, following 16"" x 20"" frame is one of the rewards in this project.
Bird and Flowers in a Shadowbox Frame
 A Story
All in a days work :-)
In 2014, I met Shakuntala at Anandwan, India; as I watched her embroider greeting cards using her toes, I was struck by her vigor and dignity in spite of her huge handicap with cerebral palsy.  I bought all greeting cards that she had available then and decided to donate to her organization.  Back home, I began thinking that the greeting card format may not be giving justice to her art.  If I framed the artwork, it would be a constant inspiration on my kitchen wall, instead of being hidden in a pile of stuff in a drawer!  I framed some of those greeting cards and yes, it worked!  I then ordered more cards and raised funds for the organization.  
When I was relating this experience to a coworker, she got so motivated, that she bought 16 frames to give to her family and friends for Christmas - she said that was the best gift she could ever give to herself!!
Why Support The project
We are motivated to work on this project because it gives us opportunity to help uplift the underprivileged artisans, giving them true self-reliance.
Variety of unique designs
It also gives us the opportunity to connect the worlds of Haves and Have Nots - leveraging our own creativity. With your help, we intend to reach out many more remote organizations across the world to bring their gifts to you!

18,1848243969,"Skateboarding drives me Crazy! But in a good way, of course. It is the most challenging activity I have ever put my mind to. The time, energy, and thought process used to learn even the simplest trick makes school and work seem like a joke. This is what makes skateboarding so addictive....not to mention it is the most fun one could possibly have. You learn how to do things that you honestly felt to be previously impossible.
For kids, I believe this activity can play a huge role in the development of a variety of positive traits. I know that skateboarding from childhood has made me a more dedicated, loyal, patient, quick thinking, understanding, and hardworking person. To be a progressive skateboarder, you have to have these attributes, anything less and you would give up on skateboarding completely.
This brings me to why I am looking to open The Garage, indoor skateboarding facility in Everett, WA.
The younger generation in this area are more excited about skateboarding then ever before. On any given day you can find the local skateparks packed to the brim with young minds hard at work on their skateboards. The only problem is, these parks are all outdoors and located in one of the wettest states in the US. That means, when it rains there is nowhere for kids to skate, while staying dry. But this can change with your help!
My wife and I are seeking $15,000 to pay for wood, screws, paint, steel, sheet metal, and labor to construct a one of a kind indoor skateboarding facility. This park will be designed and hand crafted by my friends and myself, aka Vic's Market, with the help of an experienced skatepark builder. With all parties involved having skateboarded for roughly 20 years a piece, the final product will surely be a masterpiece.
Once opened, feel free to stop by any time and skate, even if it's your first time, and enjoy watching your money being put to a good use. The kids and parents in Everett will thank you for it. Thanks for checking out our page and remember... ""With Your Help We Will Open THE GARAGE!!"""
19,443011868,"So What are You doing?
My team and I are building MerKaBa, an interactive, magical prayer portal. We will install this portal at the 2013 Burning Man event in the Black Rock Desert in Nevada. We have a grant from Burning Man to build the base structure. We are asking your support so we can purchase the equipment necessary to make our portal really hum. We want to make sure that when you encounter MerKaBa on the playa, we will have provided you with a sophisticated, interactive, psychospiritual instrument of transport.  We want to make sure you have a blast playing with our sound and light interactive toy.
The MerKaBa dome by day (computer rendering
The MerKaBa at night (computer rendering)
You're building a MerKaBa?  What in blazes is a MerKaba? 
The traditional mercaba is a mythological transport device that allows the devout worshiper a face to face audience with his or her local deity. 
The Mercaba of traditional mythology
Our MerKaBa device will be a psychedelic prayer portal for transporting thousands of Black Rock City citizens into a contemplative and celebratory interaction with their own powerful imaginations. And beyond, of course! 
As a work of art, our MerKaBa is an exploration into the nature of consensus reality and how we use it to interpret — and to shape — our experiences within predefined cultural norms. 
How exactly are you going to make this? 
We’re already started building a 9’ tall hexagonal dome out of 12 gauge steel. The steel will be plasma cut with a fractal pattern revealing a turning mirrored obelisk on the inside. The obelisk will be filled with the prayers and aspirations that you send to us and will turn 24/7 for the duration of the event until we remove your prayers to burn in the Temple Burn on Sunday night. 
Plasma cut steel panel - wicked cool!
The dome will be painted white to better reflect a hallucinatory dreamscape video montage that will be projected onto all six sides of the dome. Many of the avatars of your favorite deities, philosophic leaders or intellectual giants will make an appearance. You are free to worship, dance, sing or recite poetry as you bask in their darshan. 
Panel detail
How are you making it into an interactive instrument?
Our MerKaBa dome will be equipped with ultrasonic and infrared sensors. As you approach the dome these sensors detect your proximity and movement setting into motion an interactive array of sound and lighting effects.
Sound system schematic
We invite you to send us audio files of your prayers, yearnings, desires and demands so we can mash them into an array of different sound montages. Feel free to speak, chant, sing, scream, or whisper as feels appropriate. 
When you explore these ultrasonic and infrared triggers out on the open playa……. the musical prayers you induce from the MerKaBa dome might appeal to the local gods, attracting their divine attention. You might even stir the interest of the Giant Alien Cat Overlords rumored to be lurking nearby. 
GACOs just can't resist the MerKaBa!
Yikes! And then what happens? 
Depending upon your faith, anything might happen. 
Perhaps, rapturous angels of ecstasy will draw you into deep exotic, florid and orgasmic hallucinations of group orgiastic hierophany.
Perhaps you will discover the MerKaBa’s secret G-spot. 
Perhaps you will spend the entire week activating wave upon wave of sycophantic climax for one and all. 
Perhaps you will simply have a rollicking good time activating our visual and audio tricks. 
This project is gonna be awesome! So what do you need? 
We want to involve you, we want to entice you to contribute. We have a range of gifts to offer in return, things like MerKaBa stickers, pendants and t-shirts, as well as the opportunity to include your prayers and chants in the portal itself. For more generous donors we want to offer handmade ceramic art based on the MerKaBa theme. 
Yay Stickers!!!
Your donations will go towards the electronics, sound and light that have to be both cutting-edge, cool and bomb-proof to withstand the incredibly harsh conditions of the open playa. 
We’re thrilled to be working on this, and hope you are thrilled to be a part of it now and once we get to Burning Man!  "
20,426279405,"     Hello, my name is Alexis and I am working with my father to try and get a company off the ground with code that he has worked on for over 20 years. We are planning to make an application that will allow you to create your own art with auto optimization royalty free and be able to export said art to any other 3D modelling application. It started about 22 years ago with an idea of a better way to optimize the amount of triangles used. We have surpassed pen and paper and so close to being able to go live. We hope with some help that we can make this dream come true.            
     We are working full time on trying to get through these last few bugs and plan to have a releasable product in the next month. This means so much to us because we hope that by simplifying the process for anyone to be able to create their own art, people will be able to make games, models, and more. This application allows you to make your own 3D models that can be saved and printed out with a 3D printer. You can play with what feels like adult lego's, save and then sell what you make or use it in a new game with your own custom art!         
     We work from home so the house currently is an expense, we need more equipment, need to do a lot of advertising and time for work. So about $25,000 would be enough to push our exciting product out on the market!"

22,1068130027,"“NAMES” 
We are final year BA (hons.) Mixed Media Fine Art students at the University of Westminster, working towards our Degree Show, “NAMES”at Ambika P3, Marylebone Road in June 2015. Ambika P3 is one of the largest exhibition spaces in central London at 14000 sq. ft. Our aim is to make the exhibition an ambitious and thought-provoking presentation of our art practices across various media, which have developed over three years of study and practical engagement. The exhibition will present the culmination of three years’ hard work and will feature 44 talented young graduating artists. Due to the mixed media nature of the course, the show will feature work across a variety of creative disciplines and mediums; Westminster students continually strive to push the boundaries of contemporary art practice and self-expression. 
About the Show
BA (Hons) Mixed Media Fine Art is a 3 year, full time degree course that culminates in a final exhibition featuring a body of work by each graduating artist. With the show fast approaching, planning, organisation and fundraising are now in full swing; the show is an exciting project for us and provides both closure and a chance to exhibit our work in a professional, ambitiously scaled environment.“Names” will bridge the gap between the study of fine-art practice and our future careers as artists. However, in order to successfully put on the show we are aspiring towards there are substantial financial demands. We need your generosity to help us reach our fundraising target. We are aiming to raise £1000 through Kickstarter to help make our Degree Show truly outstanding, so that we can show the world what we’re capable of. The money pledged will contribute towards: 
• The catalogue: we aim to produce a professional catalogue as a document of the artists’ development, so that visitors to the exhibition can take away a piece of their viewing experience – this will also mean further exposure for the artists in the show. 
 • The Private View card and further publicity: alongside the catalogue we aim to produce an invitation card which can be used to publicise the exhibition to art-lovers, gallerists, friends and family. We want as many people as possible to see the work we have strived to create. 
 • Refreshments for the private view evening: everyone likes a drink! 
It is worth noting that this exhibition project is thoroughly student-led and that we are involved in every aspect of the event planning. From the design of the catalogue to the curation of the exhibition and the marketing and publicity, everything is done by the students on the course. This helps to minimise the costs of the event by ‘cutting out the middle-man’ and ensuring that the money we raise is used sparingly and appropriately. Being involved in the process from start to finish is also valuable experience for our further professional lives as independent artists. 
The Mixed Media Fine Art Degree Show at Ambika P3: 
Public View - 2 June 2014 6:30pm - 8:30pm 
Exhibition open 1 - 4 June 11am – 6pm 
Ambika P3; University of Westminster 35 Marylebone Road, London NW1 5LS 
The Rewards 
Please note that all rewards will be mailed after the Degree Show.

Be a part of it all. This new album is going to be absolutely decimating, not to mention the tour and the video, which will also be incredible!
The band is putting together funds for all of these exciting things:  touring, studio time, mastering, artwork, manufacturing for the new album, shooting and editing the new video, plus any and all incidentals which accompany such decimating activities.  With our upcoming Disco Balls to the Wall World Tour, we will be reaching billions of new fans across the globe, so it is a journey well worth joining!
Our remaining expenses come out to about $5,000 -- divided evenly between the record (including mastering, artwork and printing, etc.); the video; and the tour. It is our sincere hope that we raise this money -- but in the event we raise MORE -- worry not. The more funds we raise,  the more we can put into the production of the tour performances, the CD and the video.  Every dollar pledged will be put into making these ventures as awesome as possible. Plus, every pledge comes with a prize. There are no limits to the downloads we can give. Or the CD's and shirts (realistically as the world has a finite amount of fabrics and plastic) we can mail. 
Still thinking about it?  Well, Imagine your life before Tragedy.  Lonely.  Low-self-esteem.  Unwanted hair.  Erections lasting less than four hours.  But since Tragedy has come along, you have managed to bring together the once polarized parts of your soul: the part that likes disco and the part that likes metal.  The ""new you"" is fuller, firmer and longer than you have ever been.  Friends now describe you as ""shapely,"" ""tastefully perfumed,"" and ""supple.""  And you are a joy to be around.
No really, take a moment . . . just do it for a sec.  Imagine your life if Tragedy ceased to exist.  Flaccid.  Dry and Irritable.  Like a nasty rash.  And downright unpopular (that could refer to you as a person, or just your rash).  A pretty ugly picture, huh?  We would hate to see that happen to you, fan.
In the past, we have asked you to put a variety of things where your mouth is.  So now, we request, again, for your own well-being, dear fan, to please put your money where your mouth is, and then give us the money that is in your mouth.
You're welcome,
TRAGEDY!

Please check out the latest updates for Blaze by visiting the updates section of this Kickstarter page. Also, please visit getblaze.co.uk for additional information
Blaze is a stackable miniature development board, based around a high-resolution 1.6"" display with capacitive touch and a high-speed 32-bit ARM micro-controller.
Blaze contains an on-board Micro SD socket for storage as well as a USB socket and various analog and digital external IO to allow expansion.
Blaze is also Arduino-compatible and can be used as a interface for your Arduino projects.
Blaze is pretty powerful for its size, here's what you can expect:
Microcontroller: ARM Cortex-M4
Model: MK22FN1M0VLH12
Clock Speed: 120MHz
Flash Memory: 1MB (upgraded from 512KB)
SRAM: 128KB
Display: 1.6"" TFT
Resolution: 240x240px
Color Depth: 262,143 colors
Touch: Capacitive
System Voltage: 3.3VDC
ADC Resolution: 16-bit
ADC Channels: 2x differential or 4x single ended
DAC Resolution: 12-bit
DAC Channels: 1x 
Dimensions:
Power:
Blaze can be powered from the on-board USB socket. Alternatively, it can derive its power from the VBAT pin on the external IO header which allows Blaze to be connected to external Li-Po batteries.
The ability to be powered from Li-Po batteries makes Blaze suitable for wearable applications.
Real-Time Clock :
Blaze has an on-board real-time clock, allowing you to keep track of time. By default, the RTC is disabled and is powered via dedicated VBAT pin on one of the external IO headers. Alternatively, a jumper can be fitted to Blaze which will ensure that the RTC is powered from the on-board 3.3V regulator, however, the RTC will lose track of time when Blaze is un-powered.
PWM:
Blaze can be configured to support up to 5x 16-bit PWM outputs. These PWM pins can also be used as input capture and output compare signals.
Graphical Prowess:
The following video gives you an idea of the drawing speed of Blaze, with fast, efficient routines making in excess of 300fps possible. In fact, the drawing of the random squares in the video was clocked at 340fps!
PLAY

The following video shows how a simple 3D cube can be rendered on the display. A primitive 3D engine is being developed as part of the Blaze API.
PLAY

Blaze also provides a number of external IO and power connections. The external IO allows you to connect Blaze to your own hardware or other such platforms like Arduino or Raspberry Pi.
Note - Blaze is a 3.3V system which means that it is only compatible with other 3.3V platforms such as Arduino Zero.
Almost all of the DIO signals can be configured to perform alternative functions, such as UARTS, I2C ports, ADC inputs, etc. This allows a great deal of flexibility and connectivity when interfacing to external sensors and other hardware.
The table below shows the alternative configurations possible for each pin:
All Blaze boards come shipped with the Blaze Bootloader. This allows you to download your own code to board over USB via the Blaze IDE - a development environment similar to the Arduino IDE.
Blaze IDE makes full use of the Blaze API - a complete software library written in C++ which provides extensive access to the on-board peripherals and provides optimized routines to allow drawing on the display. 
The present API has the following features:
- Powerful, efficient drawing routines including outline and fill
- Access to all external and internal peripherals of the ARM micro
- File access through the on-board SD card socket
- Multi-language support
- Image support (formats including Bitmaps and JPEGs)
- Support for any font
The following features are planned for Blaze and will be implemented during the campaign:
- Back-buffer support
- Alpha transparency
- 3D graphical routines (drawCube, drawSphere, etc)
- Transformation routines including translation, scaling and rotation
- Animation and keyframe support
Once the Kickstarter campaign finishes, the source code for Blaze will be available on GitHub - both Blaze API and Blaze IDE projects will be downloadable.
Enhanced Programmability:
Should you wish to go one step further, the JTAG signals are available on Blaze via the external GPIO so you can load in your own baremetal code. A BSP library will be made available which will allow you to get up and running with your own baremetal code.
RTOS Support:
Blaze can also support real-time operating systems such as mbed, Freescale MQX, FreeRTOS, etc however at this present time, the required board-support packages are not available.
Software Compatibility:
For those of you already familiar with coding for Arduino, Blaze API supports a compatibility layer to ease the transition between platforms.

Using only a few lines of code, you can quickly put together powerful, beautiful displays for your applications.
Hardware Compatibility:
Due to the non-Atmel nature of the microcontroller, Blaze is only hardware compatible with the Arduino platform via the external IO - and only Arduino boards which are 3.3V compatible such as the Arduino Zero.
Here are a number of suggestions for what you could do with your Blaze:
Smart-Watch:
A elegant and beautiful smart-watch display. Why not?
Mini Calculator:A miniature calculator that you can fit in the palm of your hand!
Twitter Display:
A palm-sized display for your tweets and notifications.
Mini Map Viewer:
Display mini-maps on your Blaze. Go one step further and create a micro navigation system
Simple App Launcher:
Launch your favourite apps via a simple interface across the USB link.
It would be awesome if you could help make Blaze a success. To make Blaze extra-cool, the following stretch goals are available should this campaign be successful:
£8,000 - Blaze IoT
An add-on board which turns Blaze into an IoT widget. Featuring BLE and Wi-Fi, Blaze can be connected to a multitude of devices and even The Cloud!

All additional functionality will be supported via the Blaze API (as well as in the Arduino compatibility API) and through the Blaze IDE.
£9,000 - Blaze IoT-X
As of the latest update, should the campaign get to £9,000 then an eXtended version of the IoT board will be available. The IoT-X board includes all current features of the IoT board but with additional GPS capabilities.
Note: unlike the IoT stretch goal, sadly this one isn't a freebie and would require an additional £20 to be added to your pledge in order to get this eXtended version.
See Update #12 for more information.
£12,000 - Blaze Box
A miniature enclosure for your Blaze!
Note: please be aware that the stretch goals will not affect the manufacturing schedule for Blaze or the overall quality of the end product. Blaze is the priority for this campaign and this will not be sacrificed. 
There are two fully-working Blaze prototypes in existence. A couple of minor tweaks need to be done to the hardware prior to manufacturing the boards. 
These tweaks are:
- Altering the footprint for the touch screen connector
- Reducing the brightness of the diagnostic LED (its BRIGHT)
- Alter the footprint for the USB socket"

28,323042965,"If you would like to try out the game, you can do so. But keep in mind that it's still in alpha, and will have a lot of bugs. It's currently going through a lot of code refactoring, so saving and loading is very unstable.
Join the google group for a link & and access to the Alpha on android here.
iOS is finally open due to the initial support of the Kickstarter! Thank you everyone, and you can access the TestFlight demo here.
You will have to join the discord so that you can get access in the future.
You somehow managed to get onto a page completely dedicated to a game about potatoes killing each other.
Glad you're here though!
Welcome to DicTater, a 4X strategy game about potatoes taking over the world. 
It will be released on iOS and Android. That's right, it's a mobile game. 
But don't worry, it's not going to be one of those dumb spend-1000-hours-waiting-or-pay-50-bucks-to-progress games. It's PC quality gameplay built for the mobile phone. An actual game for the bloated mobile market.
Unlike most of the 4X games that you may have played, this one is about potatoes.
DicTater comes with special potato-themed mechanics, like deep-frying your troops, saltiness, and of course sacrificing parts of your potato population to keep the potato gods happy.
But there are also the mechanics that are expected to come with a 4X strategy game.
Your main currency will be, of course, potatoes. To train potato troops, you need potatoes. To continue certain events, you will need potatoes. To sacrifice potatoes to the potato gods, you will need potatoes.
There are various ways of generating more potatoes, but a primary way of doing so are building farms. As you progress there will be more than just farms to build: factories and administration buildings will help drive the way. 
Basic building in DicTater!
To unlock these future buildings you will have to do research in different tech trees. With currently over 100 different technologies to unlock, you'll certainly have to advance to keep up with your rivals.
Unlocking research from the 3 research trees.
Don't forget the troops! Inspired from EU4, there are three types of troops (with variable potato costs) that you can get: Infantry, Ranged, and Artillery. The battle system is simple enough for most people to get for a mobile phone, but strategy will still apply based on the geography of the land; like rivers, banks, and towers.
3 Types of Troops in DicTater.
But who are you attacking, you may ask? Other potatoes of course! The potatoes of DicTater have become more segregated over time, with the different potato cultivars skirmishing over who should reign supreme. Will you win? In-game you will rival and align with different cultivars, affecting who revolts in empire and who welcomes your rule.
3 of the 6 enemy potato factions that you'll encounter in DicTater!
To give each playthrough some replayability, different events pop up. There are HUNDREDS of different events. And if you purchase the Count of Chips tier (and above), you will be able to design one yourself.
Lots of events... Hundreds!
Now here's a generic mobile game trailer that's edited pretty alright.
DicTater's development blog also has a lot of information on the game as well, if you're so inclined.

Alright, you probably skipped to here first. That's fine, let's see what rewards we have!
Expansions will come with both free and paid updates to the game so that all players will always have something new to play with. Keep in mind that the base game will be free, but all future expansions will not be free. 
 Starting at $75, you'll be able to throw your creative ideas into the mix. Make an event chain (up to 5 events) to create a short story about potatoes.
And now we get to the big buck tiers. For $100 you'll be able to get all future expansions for free, whether that's all 5 or all 200. It could be a very good investment.
And don't forget, you get a CUSTOM POSTCARD!
Monuments are buildings from the past that show up in the map. They take an entire tile and can't be altered. They're just there to look at and fight over. You can get one dedicated to you. Read more about monuments here.
More importantly, you get a CUSTOM POSTCARD!
The main mechanic of the gameplay loop is the fact that you have to sacrifice potatoes to the potato gods. But imagine if you were a potato god. That's right, you can be a god. You can pay to be god. This will be the ONLY TIME where you can pay to win the game (since you become immortalized as God-Tier instantly). Anyone will be able to unlock you by playing a long time in-game. Your role in the discord server will give you access to a command to flex on anyone.
What's more, you get a CUSTOM POSTCARD!

 Don't think too long to decide... custom postcards take a lot of effort to make.
Read about the monument stretch goal on the blog post!
But how is DicTater's release going to actually work? Do I have to pay for the game? When is it going to be released? How are you going to communicate with backers? Is $1900 going to actually get the project anywhere? Why did you spend so long making a game about dumb potatoes?
What Am I Paying for Again?
I originally made this genre of game because all of the mobile ""strategy"" games listed on the Google Play Store were really just pay-to-win castle builders. 
The real strategy games that I liked were those on the PC, like Europa Universalis 4 and Civilization 5. So I emulated their monetization strategy with a few tweaks. 
The base game will be free. The expansions will be paid so that you only pay for what you want to play. Every major update will have a free update and a paid expansion, but bug fixes and other small additions are to be expected. There will also be different cosmetics to purchase for your potato character that have no effect on gameplay.
Testing & Release Schedule
Backers who have donated to the ""Hot Potato"" tier and above, and those who have already tested the game will be invited to alpha tests as the game is balanced and updated through development. 
The current plan is to release at least the beta of the game within the first two quarters of 2020. This will be as close to bug-free as possible, and changes will be based on game balance instead of crashes.
During that time, backers who have donated to the ""Stellar Spud"" and above will be able to test upcoming expansions and new builds of the game.
Afterwards, the game will be released fully after a stable enough version is made, hopefully in Q3 of 2020. A second expansion may come along with this launch.
Communication with Backers
I can't realistically spend all my time relaying every possible thing that happens behind the scenes AND make progress on the game. That being said, I will report to the community with:
Direct chats with potato friends in the fantabulous Discord!
Weekly reports on progress of the game's development every Saturday via the website's development blog & built-in Kickstarter messages.
A monthly message that lists all the progress made that particular month, and any special community events/notices that may come up.

Where the Money Goes
Software subscriptions and some extra hardware will help expedite the development process & build onto some platforms. Basic tier everything can only get me so far. This will be approximately 55% of the money that comes from the Kickstarter's finish.
The game will require a minimal amount of servers to send out promo codes for the game. No multiplayer is planned, but greater and greater goals will allow for more ""multiplayer"" options. This will be approximately 15% of the money that comes from the Kickstarter's finish.
I also don't want to do all of the art myself as I go forward. Being able to hire freelancer artists here and there will be helpful. This will probably happen if the project gets more than the original goal.
Besides that, all development has so far been out of my pocket, so a little bit of the money will help me eat food while I work on this. In other words, I'll be working on this game for you to play instead of working a part-time job at Walmart.
If I were to somehow get much more than the $2000 from Kickstarter, then more ambitious goals for the game can be set, along with more ambitious expenditures.
P.S. If you haven't gotten the pun yet, I can't help you."
29,1896303951,"Last year, my friend Bizhan Khodabandeh and I put together the swankest new edition of Dracula for our bookshelves with Dracula Illustrated, utilizing Bizhan's fantastic illustrations and my book design.
We're following it up by resurrecting another classic of the macabre--
Mary Shelley's iconic Frankenstein. 
Bizhan's wraparound cover art
Who was Mary Shelley? The daughter of British philosopher William Godwin and early feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, Mary's immortality was created during a foreboding storm, candlelight, and German ghost stories...
Frankenstein came to life one stormy night in Lake Geneva, when Mary and her friends dared one another to create the scariest tale. Mary out frightened Lord Byron, her husband Percy Bysshe, and the aspiring John Polidori with Frankenstein, the tale of a scientist who creates life from the dead--and is haunted and tortured for his folly in playing God.
The novel is widely considered the first science fiction book, but has clearly made a space in the horror genre.
Design subject to tweaks before production
Frankenstein Illustrated is the second in The Drawn Word's Illustrated series of classics, once again featuring Bizhan's art in a limited edition paperback. Like Dracula, it comes in a matching 5.5"" x 8.5"" size.
This time, we're also producing a series of three hardcovers, each divided into the three ""volumes"" of the novel as originally printed, that you get (along with a signed paperback) in the Volume level. 
These volumes feature different cover designs and also include Bizhan's illustrations.
Each stretch goal will add a new illustration, until we hit 6, and then gains an academic essay by myself on the evolution of Frankenstein in media. The cherry on top is metallic foil stamping on the cover of the paperback.
  And after that? We unlock levels to pledge for Bizhan's original art, such as: 
WHO THE HECK ARE WE?
Bizhan Khodabandeh teaches at Virginia Commonwealth University's Robertson School of Media and Culture and freelances under the name Mended Arrow. As an illustrator/design he has been recognized by various institutions such as: The Society of Illustrators, The American Institute of Graphic Arts, Creativity International, the International Design Awards, Adbusters, and Creative Quarterly. More of his work can be found at www.mendedarrow.com
I also teach at VCU, in the Communication Arts department, where I specialize in media and comic book studies. As you can imagine, Frankenstein--particularly the James Whale adaptation--comes up in many of my classes."

Inspiration through art
When the owners of Fire Lizard Games read the first edition eBook of Examination, they knew they'd love to incorporate the story into one of their games. After broaching the subject of using it as the thematic setting for the Adventure Module in BASE: a CaRdPG Perry Hartree was excited by the prospect and granted the rights to Fire Lizard Games.
Check out BASE: a CaRdPG here!
Re-imagining
After Perry Hartree granted the rights to Fire Lizard Games for use in BASE: a CaRdPG, Perry wanted to know more about how they developed and formatted (particularly for books in print). Throughout a handful of conversations, Fire Lizard Games agreed to assist Perry in getting greater exposure for Examination (via this Kickstarter, connections, editing, etc.). During this process, it allowed Perry to include some details that were not in the original eBook, as well.

34,311581827,"Despite the economic, political, cultural and psychological changes the world have undergone over the past decade, the Nigerian education system is still based on the National Policy on Education (NPE) introduced in 1977. This is a great shame for the country as a whole and an act of structural violence on the part of the government and every capable human being (not just Nigerians) who is able to act against such violence. Proper education is a God given right that every human being independent of race, nationality, gender, and socio-economic class should be afforded. As for Nigerians in particular, who fall victim to this outdated educational structure, they often lack the core and personal skill sets needed to affect the Nigerian society in a meaningful way as well as contribute to the world at large. As a result of this, high unemployment rates among past and recent graduates remain a major issue in the country. What is even more striking is that high unemployment covaries with almost every major issue facing the country today – rise of extremist groups (Boko Haram), youth violence, lack of infrastructure, lack of professional training, corruption, mental illness, corrupted legal system and so forth.
 To make matters worse, those who are unable to participate in the educational system fall into illiteracy as business minded and limited centers for knowledge – libraries, community centers and religious centers - lack the most basic resources in which self-education can be achieved. According to a survey conducted by the Federal Government of Nigeria and UNICEF the average rate of literacy for women in Nigeria is at an all-time low of 27% and for men 51%.
 In order to move the educational landscape of Nigeria in the right direction, independent of the government of Nigeria, O.B.A. Public Library of Nigeria’s objective is to provide a free, world-class, public library which will be a center for curating and disseminating knowledge in Nigeria’s most poverty stricken areas. This project will begin in Lagos, Nigeria and later spread to the entire country. Besides providing basic services available in almost any library in countries around the world, such as the issuing of free library membership, the borrowing and returning of children’s and academic books, journal articles, audio books, films & documentaries, access to computers for research and educational purposes, there will also be monthly lectures within different areas of academic disciplines from world class experts around the world, professional and technical workshops in which library members will be able to learn how to write a CV, business plans, use various technical softwares, data analysis, and so forth. Cultural exhibition and performances will also be available in the exhibition center of the library. Finally there will also be a research center affiliated with the library whose library members will be able to apply to be a part of the research group."

Help fund photo workshops for the next generation of Camera Kids. 
Founded in 2000, Through the Eyes of Children (TTEC) taught photography to a group of 19 children orphaned by the Rwandan Genocide Against the Tutsi who lived at the Imbabazi Orphanage in Mutura, Rwanda. The workshops were held over 11 years and the resulting photographs were exhibited throughout the world, including at the United Nations and at the premiere of the movie Hotel Rwanda. Funds raised through the children’s photography helped to pay their school fees and proved to them that people value their perspective and want to see Rwanda through their eyes. 
Today, these children, now adults, are extending the project’s mission. The photographers, or “Camera Kids” as they were called, are paying it forward, teaching photography to other vulnerable children around the world. 
This Kickstarter campaign is being launched to raise funds for photo workshops with other vulnerable children from around the world. The photo workshops will be led by three of the original Camera Kids, Mussa Uwitonze, Gadi Habumugisha and Jean Bizimana.These workshops will be captured in a documentary film by the award-winning director, Beth Murphy, and GroundTruth Films. 
Two photo workshops have already been held in the United States: working with Haitian Immigrant teenagers in New Jersey and with foster children in Boston. More workshops are planned for 2019 around the world.

Photography has played a role in the life, education and careers of these Rwandan orphans, creating a pathway to memories and community after all was lost in the genocide. Gadi, Mussa and Bizimana believe that they can create the same impact on the lives of other children.
In 2011, the original Camera Kids started a “pay it forward” program by teaching photography to other Rwandan children. In July 2018, Gadi, Mussa and Bizimana expanded the program and led workshops with Haitian Immigrant teenagers and American Foster Children. 
Through this Kickstarter campaign, we plan to conduct additional photo workshops with other vulnerable children throughout the world. Each workshop will be 4-7 days in length and will be both immersive and fun for a group of 20 children at a time. Partnerships with organizations working with vulnerable children in each location have already been established, including Worldwide Orphans who serves thousands of children around the globe and The Home for Little Wanderers in the United States.
Select photos from each workshop will be shared on the Camera Kids Instagram account to showcase the work of the children and their photos will be curated for inclusion in photo exhibitions with each partner organization.
This Kickstarter campaign is to fund Camera Kids’ photo workshops and document the process for a feature documentary film by the GroundTruth Project.
Your contribution today will cover the costs of travel, materials and salaries for Gadi, Mussa and Bizimana. 
 PROJECT HISTORY 
Through the Eyes of Children (TTEC) was conceived by photographer David Jiranek (1958 –2003) in the year 2000 in collaboration with The Imbabazi Orphanage. The Orphanage was established in the aftermath of the 1994 Rwandan Genocide Against the Tutsi by American Roz Carr, who was 82 years old when she dedicated herself to care for hundreds of orphaned children. David began the TTEC photo project at Imbabazi with annual four-week photographic workshops centered on the importance of the children’s perspective and experience. Nineteen children, ranging in ages from eight to 18, were given disposable cameras and taught the fundamentals of photography as they documented themselves and their community. Initially, their photos were developed locally in Rwanda and displayed on the orphanage walls. Since then, the same children have participated in annual workshops from 2000 – 2011. Their photographic body of work documents their lives in Rwanda as the country was rebuilding.
In the Spring of 2001, after David completed his first workshop, he invited photographer Kristen Ashburn, PR professional Jenifer Howard and brand strategist Joanne McKinney to help. When David tragically died in 2003, the project continued on through their volunteer efforts. Today, three of the original camera kids, Mussa Uwitonze, Gadi Habumugisha and Jean Bizimana, stepped up to lead TTEC for the future.
The children’s work has been widely recognized and has been exhibited around the world in such prestigious venues as the United Nations in New York, the Human Rights Watch International Film Festival, The Holocaust Museums of Houston, Texas, and Naples, Florida and at several universities throughout the U.S. and in Europe. Over the course of 15+ years and through the sale of the children’s photography, significant funds were raised to fund the secondary school education for all of the children at the orphanage.  
Check out the work of the original Rwandan camera kids here: 
Today, the Camera Kids are adults, living and working in Rwanda - a number in the field of photography. As this project comes full circle, Gadi, Mussa and Bizimana, once child photographers and Camera Kids themselves, are bringing their work, their lives, their achievements and their hope for tomorrow directly to the next generation of Camera Kids.  They are a true success story of how love, education -- and photography -- can transform lives.
For a historical perspective on the photo workshops, watch this video:
 Why This, Why Now? 
What started as a project to bring happiness into the lives of orphans has morphed into a powerful, life-changing means of work, income and artistic expression. A number of the original Camera Kids have gone on to embrace photography in their careers. Some work as photojournalists for organizations such as Reuters, staff photographers for Starwood Hotels and others work as photo tourism guides, wedding photographers and studio photographers. It is a natural progression of the Project to pay it forward and help other vulnerable youth throughout the world realize the power  of sharing their story through the lens and eyes of children. The resulting documentary film will be a powerful message of hope and transformation that the world should see.
Why Kickstarter?
As a very small, all-volunteer organization, Through the Eyes of Children has dedicated itself to teaching photography to other vulnerable children throughout the world. When this project started, no one thought that photography would change lives -- but it did. Now that the Camera Kids are grown up and ready to take this social impact project to a broader, global scale, they need your help! Your donation will help to cover the necessary funds to run the photo workshops and then to help fund the documentary that will follow their progress. 
Every dollar you donate to this Kickstarter campaign will go directly to support the photo workshops.

-solve the hunger crisis
-reduce trash
-save environment
Just imagine to get rid of all four problems just with one idea. That´s what this project is about.
to produce just 1 kilogram of meat, you need 6 kilograms of corn, 6 kilograms of grass and lots of protein. And of course not to forget you need about 6000 liters of water! Considering the high amount of meat that is produced, it is an unbelievable number of resources we need for the protein. Adding another fact might make you rethink the way you consume protein: About 50% of the fish we catch isn’t used for human consumption but for feeding our kettle for example. It´s simply inefficient. Environmentally and social.
There are huge problems because of trash in Africa. Not just Africa. Around the whole globe there is a massive trash issue. In Kamerun, were i come from , where I grew up, there is just a single waste disposal company. Consequently the people just throw their waste on the streets, which causes a massive trash crisis.
We want to solve exactly these problems with growing and selling the larvae of the black soldier fly as alternative to use these as animal feed, because it´s rich on protein, thus we don´t have to overfish our seas and reduce the trash as well.
With the money I get from you guys, I want to buy a biochemical reactor by the Hermetia company to produce the larvae.
Thank you very much for helping to save the planet we live on and to start a revolution on the way we consume our Proteins"

 Benghazi – Bergen-Belsen is an original play inspired by a novel of the same name (see at Amazon). Set in 1945, when the Nazi holocaust turned onto the Jews of Libya, the play gives voice to an aspect that is conspicuously absent from prevalent stories of the Jewish holocaust. By citing the marginalized racial politics of the holocaust, the show urges a reconsidering of both historical and contemporary religious, cultural, and racial oppression and violence. It does this with a contemporary approach, a uniquely multicultural cast (of Israeli, Palestinian, Moroccan and Italian origins), world fusion music score and modern, artistic light design. 
  Benghazi – Bergen-Belsen is narrated in the voice of Silvana Hajaj, an ambitious young Jewish feminist from Benghazi, Libya. Silvana is transported with her family to the Bergen-Belsen, Germany concentration camp. There, Silvana meets Rebecca, a young Dutch Jew, and the play tracks their encounter which is layered with cultural and sexual tensions.
After being caught stealing water Silvana and Rebecca are locked in a shack where they must decide - within an hour - which one of them shall be executed. Rebecca asks Silvana to tell her to use her last minutes to tell her a story, the story of her family from Benghazi in North Africa to Bergen-Belsen, in the heart of Germany. The timeline shifts between Silvana's journey and her destination - the concentration camp. Tensions between Silvana and Rebecca culminate in a compelling experience, intricate and laden with lust, dreams, fears, and questions of femininity.
Although the play is set 70 years ago, the performance is rendered in a contemporary aesthetic.

The story of Libyan and other non-white Jewish communities continues to be ignored in the present day. Underscoring the contemporary urgency of the story, the play features both historical and present-day images of New York, Europe, Syria, Africa, and the Middle East. Rather than reconstruct the past, the scenic and costume design express contemporary society’s continuing role in a long tradition of cultural repression and oppression.

39,221125675,"Alfonzo's Arctic Adventure is a brand-new platformer game for the NES. After running a successful campaign in 2017 to fund production of Eskimo Bob: Starring Alfonzo, I've been hard at work creating something even bigger and better. This time, Bob is missing, and it's up to Alfonzo to find him. Great care was taken to preserve everything that made the original so much fun, while at the same time creating something new and exciting. I'm extremely proud at how this game has turned out.
I will also be porting the game to Nintendo 3DS and Steam, complete with achievements. All backers for the digital tier or above will be given the choice between a 3DS or Steam download key in addition to the NES ROM. These ports will be released after the NES launch, later in 2019.
Alfonzo's Arctic Adventure is packed with tons of new features and content!
Four different playable characters
Over 90 levels split into 6 episodes  
More than 30 types of enemies to encounter  
Seven unique boss battles
Unlockable boss rush mode  
World map for level selection
Secret exits and branching paths
Password function to save progress
Two-player melee mode
And so much more...
Programming for this game is already complete. The game has been in development for the past year and is fully playable. All that is left to do now is produce physical copies of the game on cartridge, as well as print boxes and manuals, which is why your help is needed!
In Alfonzo's Arctic Adventure, you take the role of Alfonzo on a quest to find your missing best friend, Bob. Knowing that Bob's favorite food is fish, you decide to collect as many fish as you can while searching for your friend. With your trusty stick by your side, travel through over 90 levels filled with puzzles, traps, and enemies around every corner. Luckily, you aren't alone on your adventure! You will meet new friends along the way, each with different abilities to help you on your quest. These include the power-punching Magnus, the near-invulnerable Fenwood, and the sword-wielding Girl.
Use these four characters to explore over 90 levels, collecting fish and battling baddies along the way! You can even choose a character and face off against your friends in Two-Player Melee Mode!
Solve puzzles and avoid traps!
Explore dangerous castles and caverns!
Travel across 6 different maps, each with branching paths and secret exits!
Do battle against seven unique and deadly bosses.
Challenge a friend in two-player melee mode!
Alfonzo's Arctic Adventure will be available both as a ROM and in physical cartridge form! Cartridges will be available in both ""Classic Grey"" and ""Snowy White"" colors. There are even bundle options available if you'd like to receive more than one copy of the game.
The NES ROM for Alfonzo's Arctic Adventure along with a PDF of the instruction manual.

Soundtrack
You can even get the 24-track soundtrack for Alfonzo's Arctic Adventure on either CD or vinyl LP!
Vinyl will be limited to one pressing. Any vinyl left after the campaign may be sold via another method.
The original Eskimo Bob was a 40 kilobyte NROM game, similar in size and scope to Super Mario Bros. This is the most basic type of NES game. For Alfonzo's Arctic Adventure, I wanted to push things further, so I decided to use a mapper to allow me to use a technique called bank switching.
The NES can only access 40 kilobytes of data at a time, no matter how large a game is. 32 kilobytes of this is program (PRG) data, and 8 kilobytes is graphical (CHR). Bank switching allows for multiple banks of PRG and CHR data to be accessed from within the same ROM, effectively tricking the NES into accessing more data than it was originally designed to handle. This technique was used for most games released later in the NES's lifecycle.
Alfonzo's Arctic Adventure is a much bigger game than Eskimo Bob.
In the case of Alfonzo, I used 4 PRG banks and 16 CHR banks, bringing the total size of the ROM up to 256 kilobytes. In terms of the original NES, this is comparable in size to games like Super Mario Bros 2, Zelda 2, or Punch Out. Using these extra banks has given me space to include more levels, characters, enemies, and environments than I had in the original. It also allowed me to add new features such as world maps, secret exits, cut scenes, and animated backgrounds.
A prototype cartridge of Alfonzo has been thoroughly tested on real NES hardware as well as various clone systems, including the RetroUSB AVS, Retro-Bit RES+, Hyperkin RetroN HD, and RetroN 5. The only system found to be incompatible with the game was the RetroN 5.
The cartridge contains a multi-region CIC, allowing it to be played worldwide on both NTSC and PAL systems. The game is also coded to recognize which type of system it is running on, using different timing settings for each region. This means the game will look and sound great, no matter where you play it.
The ROM will run on any emulator that supports mapper 11, including Mesen, FCEUX, Nestopia, and most other modern NES emulators. It has been tested and works with both Everdrive and Powerpak. I have also compiled an MMC1 version of the game, allowing for compatibility with emulators that do not support mapper 11. Both versions of the ROM will be included with your download.
Spoony Bard Productions is a one-man team run by me, Tomas Guinan. I've been a part of the NES community since 1997, but it was 20 years before I created first NES game, Eskimo Bob, in 2017. Since then, I've also developed the NES version of Galf for Limited Run Games, and am now working on releasing Alfonzo's Arctic Adventure.
To say that I made Alfonzo's Arctic Adventure by myself wouldn't be entirely true. There is one song in the game that was composed by Elijah, my 12-year-old son. It's actually the final song featured in the game's trailer! If you're interested in hearing more of his work, check out Mango Schmango on Youtube.
I would also like to thank my wife, Shannon, who has been the most loving and supportive partner/beta tester I could ever ask for. I never could have done this without her constant support and encouragement."

3D Model to 3D Print
Innovation:
We’ve taken lessons from the past and incorporated them into a high quality tool which should last for years.
Non-leaking – Due to our true-fit & self-sealing tip technologies
Non-Jamming – Due to our tip/tube design architecture
Stable Heating control – Due to our dynamic temperature algorithm
Heat draft protection – Due to convection insulation housing
Fire protections – In the Tip, Heated Build Platform, and Firmware
Audible Alarm (option) – in case of thermal runaway (possible fire) detection
Threaded sensor mountings – Further reducing opportunity for thermal runaway
Efficient Cooling & Insulation – Keeping your spindle bearings cool and protecting your CNC
Integrated filament filter – A must for a CNC working environment to prevent particulate jams
Simplified Touch Screen Interface – A child could operate this tool 
Innovative Print-Head Assembly
Accuracy:
Accurate Results -- 5mm calibration test print
Reliability:
We have hundreds of hours of test time on our prototypes, including very long print jobs of over 40 hours with no problems at all. 
Requirements: 
Any 4-axis (or more ) CNC milling machine and a sliced 3D model; However, if we get enough requests we may be able to accommodate a 3-axis CNC by designing the 4th axis driver into our controller box before the end of the campaign, but your machine controller software must still support 4-axis. This would then be an new 3DPA reward since it requires a different Controller box and additional cable. Please contact us with all requests ... We aim to please. 
The 3DPA is intended as an accessory attachment for your CNC mill to be used like any other accessory tool. To simplify things further we'll even include a model converter which will convert g-code models originally intended for 3D printers to run on your CNC with your normal CNC software. That way you can download models directly from thingiverse.com or any other model storage website, slice them with any program you want, and print them with your existing CNC software; or you can simply create your own. 
How close are we to finishing?
We’re very close … We’ve been working on this project for over 10 months now and our fully functioning prototypes perform extremely well; with hundreds of hours of test time, we feel good about this product. We still need to clean things up a bit for production, so the final products may look slightly different than shown here, and we may refine a few things, but that's about it. 
See an early prototype test run below. We sped it up to save time.

41,699264302,"""Layers"" is a collaboration between  photographer, Asiko,  floral designer, Jo Wise and make- up artist Jade Soar. This beautiful collection of powerful portraits explores and challenges our conceptions of beauty and ageing.
Women from various backgrounds aged between 19 and 90 years were photographed in front of an evolving flower wall during a three week period. Layers of fresh flowers were added to the wall as the project progressed. The added layers represent the growth and depth gained through life’s experiences, the ageing flowers display the passage of time.
A diverse group of women was selected and includes a scientist, a Team GB gold medal winner, a journalist, a musician, an artist and a writer. The subjects and their life stories are the backbone to the exhibition. 
You can read more about the story behind ""Layers"" here:
https://floralcircus.wordpress.com/2016/01/29/layers-a-celebration-of-women-and-nature/
We are so proud of this project, we presented the images online, along with a press release at the end of January, within the first two weeks of circulation it was featured on:
Huffington Post, Creative Boom & Culture Trip
http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2016/01/28/layers-photo-series-celebrates-women_n_9099028.html  
We have since been invited to exhibit ""Layers"" in  three different areas. The first two coming up very soon for International Women's Day 8th March.
1. The South Bank Arts Centre, London as part of the Women of the World Festival.
2. The Women's Equality Party board room in London.
3. Winter Pride Arts Award - Islington Arts Factory 16th -22nd April
We really need some help financing the printing of these portraits so we can exhibit at these hugely prestigious venues.
The printing for each exhibition is £500. 
The first two exhibitions are in less about 2 weeks time, so I have set a target for £1000.00 in 10 days. If we can raise this, we can get these images all the way to the South Bank, which would be really wonderful.
We hope you could help us achieve our goal of exhibiting these powerful images in a few weeks time.
Should we be able to exceed the minimum goal £1000  on 10 days, we could be on our way to printing a set of images for Winter Pride Art Awards in April.

42,555535856,"35 mm film is history. All film companies are converting to digital and if we don't upgrade our projectors, and sound your only affordable theater will close it's doors at summers end.
This theater has essentially been here for the last 35 years. At one point it was the only theater. Many of our local residents recall coming here as high school students and enjoying the 2 hour escape of cinematic adventure. Times have changed.
A movie to a child is an enlightenment of fantasy, the possibility of what they can dream about for their future. For an adult, it's an escape from work, stress of bills, everyday monotony. It gives someone that time away to get lost into someone else's world.
With the average movie ticket at the large corporate owned theaters costing $10-$12 per adult and at least $7 per child, a family of four would be looking at $34-$40 just to see a movie. That crazy price doesn't include any snacks, drinks, candy, pizza, french fries, chicken tenders, etc.(which we have, by the way.)  Whereas our ticket prices of $3.00 per person, and just $1.50 for Military, Police, and Firefighters allows a family of four at our theater to enjoy snacks, dinner, or lunch and still come in under that price.
We don't feel the need to highly inflate our prices and make it nearly impossible for hard working families to be able to have some fun and good quality family time.
The economy has taken a hard hit and down shifted into lack of funds for most of our residents of this area. WE have changed this theater into a fun, family friendly, and clean atmosphere as best we could five years ago. So let's do this. We want to say thank you for your donation. How does FREE concession, or FREE movies sound? (Unfortunately we can't match dollar to dollar or we wouldn't be getting the equipment paid for. We want to at least be able to say thank you.)
Anyone who donates $10 will get a $10 concession credit. 
Anyone who donates $25 will get 10 free movie passes 
Anyone donating $100 or more will receive a $100 credit toward a private theater rental for a birthday party, corporate event, holiday party, etc. 
Any LARGE CORPORATE donations, we can host a holiday party or seminar, etc. And your donation is a business write off. (Can contact us directly for more info.)
EVERYONE who donates will have our sincerest gratitude. 
We have donated to many community events, school fund raisers, and charity events. Any time someone comes in asking for a donation we do our very best to contribute. This area needs this theater. With that being said, we are now asking for the communities help in return. 
We MUST upgrade our 35 mm equipment into Digital Cinema. Hollywood is doing away with 35 mm film and going 100% digital. As of right now, this theater would not be able to play such great blockbusters as Transformers 4, Avengers 2, God is Not Dead, Brick Mansions, Godzilla, or Blended, to name a few. Without the films being available, this theater will have to close its doors at the end of August. 
We are not corporate. We are a mom, and dad in our 30's with 5 daughters. We don't want the community to lose its only affordable entertainment, and we don't want to lose our family business. We need your help. PLEASE help us. Help our community. It's in your hands."

44,861066176,"New quadruple power in 3D printing
Four colors 
Four materials
Four nozzle sizes
Ooze- and drip-free
Excellent surfaces
More efficiency during the printing process – considerably less production time
The Multex4Move – new print-head technology
Der Multex4Move - die neue Druckkopf-Technologie - Kampagnentext deutsch
The Multex4Move provides for distinct improvements on several levels that open up completely new dimensions in the field of 3D printing. Due to the clever design, oozing (dripping during multiple hotend printing) is finally a thing of the past. We achieve this by only allowing our active nozzle to be in direct contact with the model.
In this campaign you can order either a Multex4Move extruder by itself, or together with proven Multirap M420 3D-Printer (as construction kit).
Quad Extruder Multex4Move
  The inactive nozzles are retracted, effectively sealed and cleaned before each new use. Color mixing and oozing is fully a thing of the past.
Multex4Move Hotends
  The four hotends have separate heating elements, temperature regulators and filament feeds and are therefore the basis for more flexibility and a considerably higher level of performance, e.g. in the case of complex printed parts. Therefore, we not only achieve more variability, but also better printing quality and diversity that have not been possible up until now – plus an extreme reduction in printing time. In this way, it is possible to print quick and stable inner structures with large nozzle diameters and flow rates. It is also possible to achieve fine surfaces by printing with a small diameter nozzle during the same print run; all of that is completely ooze-free!
Oozing-free 3D-Prints with Multex4Move
    This technology provides significant advantages when using water-soluble filament for supporting structures. The separation is clear and clean; the pulping process takes place trouble-free and provides for high-quality results.
water-soluble support structures
  The number “4” in Multex4Move stands for four nozzles that are used in parallel within a single print run. With Multex2Move, the version with two print heads, Multec has already reached series-production readiness; the enhanced version with four print heads is almost ready for production. Both print heads, Multex2Move and Multex4Move, have the same nozzle automation system and use the same cleaning process. Both functions have been tested in successful series tests for Multex2Move, and both are already ready for production in the case of Multex4Move. In the case of Multex2Move, two powerful drive steppers with steel planetary gear and 5:1-transmission provide for high-torque and slip-free feeding. The feed mechanism has been tried and tested by Multec since 2014, is fail-safe and operates the Multex2Move via a Bowden connection.
Multex Bowden-Extruder
  Due to an extremely strong feed stepper motor, the automatic feed system used for Multex4Move is also capable of transporting four filaments independently of one another.
This feed automation system has been tested on a technical level and is extremely strong, just as in the preceding models.
Two color gimbal created in a single printing session
  The fine tuning for serial development is currently taking place in two areas; firstly in the adaptation of software, and secondly in the optimization of weight and size.
As a result of this, oozing shields and cooling of nozzles when printing will no longer be necessary. No more need for elaborate software adaptations just to prevent oozing.
Easy and perfect Multi-Color-Printing
  The additional flexibility gained during the printing process allows for unprecedented possibilities - It is even possible to upgrade the Multex2Move to a Multex4Move. This is yet another advantage due to the freedom and flexibility of this design.
Thread with nut printed together
The hotends that come installed are tried and tested Multec hotends which been optimized for great printing results on the new Multex4Move with active cooling and optimized cooling elements. The nozzles can be changed quickly and easily and are available in various sizes.
Software
At the moment the Multex4Move and Multex2Move can be fully utilized with slicers that support multiple materials. At Multec we generally use Simplify3D as a slicer due to specific advantages it offers for printing with multiple materials. It allows us to utilize a parameter for the “next” X/Y” coordinate so that all hotends can be covered when the printer is in motion and not printing (Called “free travel” in Simplify3D). Using the Multex2Move or the Multex4Move in conjunction with the free printing action, you can avoid stringing between printed areas. This means that with the Multex4Move you can avoid stringing problems in single material prints as well as prints using multiple materials.  
At the moment, one of our current tasks is to build a similar feature directly into the firmware. This would add the capability of closing the hotends during “free travel” independant of the slicer being used.

La plateforme facilitera ainsi la rencontre entre des jeunes qualifiés prêts à investir leur temps et se déplacer jusqu'au domicile/à la bibliothèque pour faciliter la réussite des autres élèves.
Loin d'une atmosphère de compétition qui peut se retrouver dans certaines classes préparatoires, les étudiants-tuteurs créeront un milieu d'accompagnement académique d'excellence pour leurs élèves, sans les codes parfois lourds de l'enseignement en classe ""classique"".
Afin de promouvoir la qualité d'enseignement des étudiants-tuteurs et donc du service proposé par la plateforme, ils seront sélectionnés selon leur niveau d'étude et leur capacité à transmettre leurs connaissances des matières étudiées et des concours d'entrée aux grandes écoles.
Le projet possède une forte dimension d'intérêt général dans le sens où il vise à faciliter la rencontre d'une offre discrète et d'une demande parfois insatisfaite. Il n'y aura aucunement besoin pour les étudiants de se mettre en auto entrepreneur, statut jugé compliqué par beaucoup de jeunes qui préfèrent donner des cours de leur côté, comme il se fait déjà en toute légalité.
La demande d'adhésion par un étudiant-tuteur sera gratuite, chacun aura un profil détaillé pour que l'élève puisse identifier le tuteur qui correspondra le mieux au concours qu'il souhaite réussir.

48,1260612280,"  The Art Department is a nonprofit alternative art space from Portland, Maine, working with adults with developmental disabilities. We work with lots of mediums, from studio art, multimedia, animations, and print, to audio, film, and radio. We are an incredibly important resource in our community that encourages our artists and gives them a place where they can make art and have their voices heard. Our space includes a working studio, retail store and screening space, and  provides equipment, supplies and education so our artists can learn skills and make awesome projects. With all projects and artwork that we sell, the artists receive 75% of the sale price, with 25% going back to the program for supplies.
THE BIG IDEA!
Our big idea is to create an online news show called ""The Art Department News"" that shares the amazing things going on in our home state of Maine, and better engage in our community by interviewing incredible local heroes, working with our local radio station, investigating historical curiosities, working with local Maine filmmakers, reviewing local museums and galleries, collaborating on bigger and better public art projects, and expanding our presence throughout Portland and beyond. Our plan is to use the money from this campaign to buy a computer and camera in order to develop hands-on techniques in journalism, such as interviewing, audio, animation, and design, to bring ""The Art Department News"" to life! Most recently we started a newspaper called ""Sunny All Day News"", which inspired us to come up with the idea for the online show. ""Sunny All Day News"" focuses on all of the good news, people, and projects in our community. We would love to grow this project to include the digital news show, and become a quarterly news series in conjunction with our print newspaper.
Practicing our interviewing skills!
We work so incredibly hard to produce quality projects that enrich our artists and support them in leading fulfilling, happy, and productive lives, and we want to share our amazing Portland community with the world.  With your help and support, we will be able to showcase the amazing things that happen here in Portland every day.
We have a lot of experience in a range of media, and have confidence in our abilities to take on something big. We have worked on long term projects ranging from ongoing monthly art shows (we have had over 40 exhibits since our program started!), to writing, directing, producing, and editing over 50 video projects, which we showcase in sold out TV Show screenings at the Space Gallery in Portland. We even had a three month residency at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Maine where we created a newsroom installation and a publication called the Lazer Hotel Magazine. 
For the last two years we have been working hard on various projects with limited resources. We have been borrowing cameras from our staff, and sharing one super old computer between 25 artists. We have been able to do some really amazing things, but just think about what we could do with our own new working equipment! We need your help to bring our skills and ambitious idea to the next level. We have done so much so far- just wait until you see where we can go from here!

Coming from different backgrounds, Countries and social classes, we have decided to come together to write various short plays around the theme of home, exploring what home means to us within the current political climate. 
The reason we're putting on this night is to go against the idea that women can't work. With around only 10% of theatre in the UK being written and produced by women, we decided to produce our own writing night, celebrating women's ideas beyond the stereotypes we are expected to withhold as female-identifying creatives. 
This night means celebrating women and progression, simply to show women have the will and talent to work in any way they can. We endeavour to develop from our current project and reach out to more artists from working class and BAME backgrounds. Your donations will give us the means to carry out this night of new writing, thus allowing us to work...and isn't that what its all about? 
As a group we are beyond excited to carry out this project, to learn and grow as a team, but most importantly to use our skills as writers to put on a thought provoking and enthralling night of fringe theatre.

50,1310037208,"My son attends Dorris Place Elementary, a neighborhood public school in the Elysian Valley neighborhood. Our school is a Title 1 school (more than half of the students qualify for free or reduced cost lunches) with more than a quarter of the students classified as English language learners. I wanted to fill a gap and provide an opportunity for gifted and engaged students to challenge themselves with a writing program.
With the support of the principal, teachers and parents, I organized a 12-week writing course, meeting once a week in the school library an hour before school starts. This opportunity is completely free for the students, who are not required to come, nor are they graded. But each week the children have showed up, eager to learn and share and work.
After teaching this class for the first time last year, I realized the gifts of learning and teaching and sharing flow both from me to the students and from them back to me. After more than three decades of writing (as a student, then as a journalist, novelist and editor) I have learned a few things about writing — mostly the hard way — so feel lucky to have the opportunity to reach students early in their writing careers and share with them some of what I have learned (especially about discipline, the non-fatal nature of hard work, overcoming fear and insecurity, building a community of writers and showing respect to each other). In turn the young writers have surprised me with the sophistication of their ideas, and the power of imaginary beings to express emotions in ways that young people are often not allowed to in real life. We are nearly ready to share another collection of stories with you. About a third of the writers are students who participated last year and have clearly continued to push themselves. The other two thirds of the class are new to this process, and have chosen on their own to participate. In order to manifest something tangible from our writing work — a published book — we need funds to pay for printing costs. We have already raised nearly $1000 from selling copies of the book we published last year, so we are looking for support to raise another $4000, (happy to say this is less than we needed to raise last year). As we did last year, we will use funds we earn from those sales to purchase new books for our school library. Oh and of course we’ll gift copies of our own book too.
(You can check out how NPR covered the interesting backstory of the library itself, as parents transformed it from a shuttered unused resource into something extraordinary).
The kids have delivered. And in the process we have learned about writing, about fruit trees and sharing, about how hard it is to write and revise a story and about what we can do if we set our minds to it.
I hope you will join me to support these writers. Your money will continue our powerful process: first the funds will pay for the book printing, then when we sell those books, we will use the proceeds to buy more books from other authors, which can help inspire more Dorris Place Writers, who then may produce more books. Imagine the dividends.
Please help me show these kids that the power of community is as wondrous as the power of books. I thank you and the Dorris Place writers thank you."

52,1056382966,"I've been working back towards this for years.
Blackbird was ""my"" comics character going back to my high school days in the 1990s, a teenage vampire superhero who soon changed into a 1940s pulp crimefighter, and then a late '30s superhero who embraced my love of all things old school. I self-published one issue of a black and white comic book in 2000, and just haven't gotten around to fully rebooting him.
Then, life happened, and I put Blackbird on the back burner.
In the past five years, I've started writing two different types of projects: the Eagle Force Pulps starring Lee Fine, aka the Cat, which got me back to writing fiction, and a series of war documentaries for my friends at Lionheart Film Works. In that time, I've researched and written about several wars, including World War I and II, and developed a work ethic that lets me laugh in the face of deadlines.
It is time for Blackbird.
Who is Blackbird? Some of my Eagle Force fans have seen him teased, and this is going to be a distinctly unrelated version, in his own continuity.
Blackbird is Adam Durant, an aspiring radio actor in the city of New Bremen, who is forced into the life of a crimefighter when his father is attacked by an old nemesis.
Now, what is Blackbird to me? It's a love letter to the old Republic movie serials, my favorite vintage radio shows, Will Eisner's The Spirit and some of the best early comic books. Blackbird is even more to me, though: it's a chance for me to reconnect with my father in print, who lived to work in radio, and died nine years ago.
Blackbird: Flight of Death, is written in a pulp style under the gun of a looming deadline. This isn't meant to be high art, or great literature: this is meant to be an entertaining, character-based, action-packed read that doesn't let up.

The Fox said, ""I will eat that chicken.""
Maybe not a direct quote, but not hard to imagine. If a fox could talk. FOX FARM NEEDS A CHICKEN COOP! Help us protect these vulnerable, helpless, homeless chickens! We have a 12'x12' coop on a slab planned, with a generous chicken run. The estimated cost is $5,500.
First, a little background. Fox Farm sits on the 2.5 acres of Hapeman Ranch, a former walnut orchard established in the 1920's. Though the black walnuts are mostly gone now, the orchard has diversified with over 100 various fruit and nut trees. It's irrigated by a catfish pond for the rich nutrients in the fish waste, and no toxins have been used on this property for over 25 years. Nestled amid housing subdivisions not two miles from downtown Riverside, the property furtively coexists with the encroaching suburban development that surrounds it.
I'm Scott Berndt. I started Fox Farm with the Hapemans to restore this property as a working farm. I named it after a pair of grey foxes that mate here and call it home. I plant seasonal row crops that I have sold to the Riverside Food Co-op, and have donated produce and plants to various local nonprofit and community organizations. I have already done a couple of successful community events.
Recent Fox Farm events
Now I would like to add happy, naturally fed, healthy egg-laying chickens to this here farm outfit. I have 15 years of experience raising them on my grandparents' ranch in South Dakota. And I just love chickens. Chickens whose skinny necks won’t end up in the jaws of our happy, wild and healthy grey foxes. The poor chickens wouldn't survive an evening in the current coop.

Current Chicken Run
Chicken Coop wall - Not Secure
Chicken Coop Wall - termite ridden
And the Chicken said, ""Whoa, what now?""
These are guileless birds. FOX FARM NEEDS A CHICKEN COOP! What I plan is a pre-built shed from Home Depot to save on expenses. Nothing too fancy. Just sturdy enough to last and keep the hens safe. I will also build a good sized outside run with strong wire on the sides and top to keep the foxes' neighbors, the raccoons, from climbing over. Here's a picture of the building I'll convert to a coop by adding nest boxes and roosts.
New Secure Chicken Coop
I'll build an exterior chicken run attached to the coop, with a door for the chickens to enter and exit.
Chicken Run - but mine will have a roof also.
It will be similar to this chicken run attached to the bar, but I will put a strong roof on top. Raccoons, foxes, owls and hawks will not get to my chickens!
And finally...the chickens will be driving a tractor. Sort of driving. The chickens will keep the bug and weed population under control under a ""chicken tractor."" A chicken tractor is a movable coop that you wheel to different spots to let the chickens dig, scratch, and eat weeds and bugs. This way they roam but are safely caged. And they leave droppings to fertilize the patch where they forage. Here's a picture.

If you would find yourself with an old computer today, and found something you didn't quite understand, what would you do? Google it on your smartphone, right?
128k was built on that premise, and you had to use the real life internet to solve problems in the game. Even send email to an actual email adress. Feel free to try it out here!
It didn't take long until the positive reviews started pouring in, asking for a more in-depth, longer sequel. And with the help of Kickstarter, I hope to do just that with 256k. Don't worry, it's just a temporary name.

And More!!
By crowdfunding MWDH, I will be able to afford additional assets and partial voice acting for the game! 
I will also be able to dedicate more time toward art and writing for the game and hire assistants to speed up the process! Hopefully leading to a much more polished game in a shorter amount of time. Because this project has become so big, crowdfunding the game will also make it possible for a F2P version to exist so that everyone can experience a full playthrough of the game.
Where is my money going?
❤ Art Assets and Writing: A large chunk of the funding is going toward Art creation. Background commissions, and hiring assistants to help with artwork. 
Despite being a one man team, I will be paying myself for writing. Why? Paying myself fairly as well ensures that I can spend more time on the project without worry. this money will also count as contingency/safety net money. if something goes wrong or if I need extra for certain assets, this money can help pay for it.
❤ Voice Acting: another chunk of the games funding is going toward voice talent! Hiring talented voice acting costs a lot of money! This game will be partially voiced. Why only partial? It would be extremely irresponsible and unwise to fund voice acting without a complete wordcount of the game!
❤ Programming: a lot of the basic programming has already been done for the demo! But since i am not a coder i will be hiring an experienced programmer in order to make the game more polished, run smoothly, and help me out with the work that has already been completed.
❤ Music: Several tracks will be commissioned by a talented composer to make the sound of the game just as magical as the story! 
❤ Kickstarter Rewards and Goodies: Unfortunatley merch doesn't grow on trees! In order to pay for the rewards some money would need to go toward it as well!
❤ Kickstarter fees: Kickstarter takes about 8-10% of the money earners for processing fees! 
6400 USD [REACHED!!!]
As of right now everyone has one basic pose with multiple outfits, If I meet this stretch goal I will add a second pose to the heroes and villains.
 6900 USD [REACHED!!!]
This stretch goal adds additional musical tracks to the game! The main heroes will get battle versions of their leitmotifs to make the game more rich!
7900 USD [REACHED!!!]
If this goal is met I will add a romantic route for the nightmare agent, Opal to the Deluxe version of the game. The money will go toward additional art, writing, and voiced lines for Opal! 

 9100 USD [REACHED!!!]
In order to reduce the cost of the game, I prioritized the fantastical magical background art of Chalcedonia and related areas. If this goal is met, I'll be able to commission more original background art!

 10,000 USD [REACHED!!!]
Right now the fairies share a joint friendship route, but if this goal is met, I'll add in separate romance route in the DX version for Valerie's fairy partner, Diana! The money will go toward additional writing, art, and voiced lines for Diana! Opal's route will also become free-to-play if this goal is reached!

I am the main writer for the game, the lead artist, character designer, and I also made the logo and GUI. I'm a full-time college student and a freelance artist, as you can imagine that makes me quite a bit busy! Despite this I'm pretty much hopelessly devoted to this project <3 You can find me on Twitter and Tumblr, and email me at XereghaL@gmail.com for general inquiries and DiamondHeartVN@gmail.com for MWDH related questions!

I came up with the concept in 2014, back then it was a smaller scale project meant to be a NaNoRenO game, but it has grown far beyond my imagination since then <3 I have dabbled in Ren'Py before but this will be my first full fledged release (Liam goes to snurch doesn't count!). 

I have been working on the game alone for the past few years, but now there are many talented people who help and support me make the game become much more magical than it ever was before! 
Some of the people who help with the project are:

Diamond - Co-Writer, Idea bouncer
RenaHeart - Art Assistant
Mochiskii - Art Assistant
Raka - Background Artist
Tea Marie - Music
TellerFarsight - Programming

57,570540023,"Hello,
I'm Lucretia, (Lulu for short); a New York based artist with a focus on surrealism presented through the lens of women's mental health. You can see my work HERE. 
In the past I have mainly focused on print work and individual pin creation to moderate success, and as such I have decided to expand my repertoire with a new series of pins that I have entitled the ""Strange Objects"" series. 
Human beings, often unconsciously, tend to see faces in objects. In these moments of anthropomorphic pareidolia we project features, emotions and scenarios onto inanimate objects. The ""Strange Objects"" series was born of this idea: a wilting flower filled with misery, a melting candle all too aware of its own mortality, the lamp at your bedside which watches you toss and turn in your sleep. Common items made uncomfortably human in their characteristics. 
As this is a niche series, I have decided to bring the project to Kickstarter for sake of funding. I am hoping these pins will delight others who view the world a little differently, the casual fans of the cute and the disconcerting, and any and all who might just enjoy the idea of a chair with human legs.
Because Kickstarter is an all or nothing funding platform, these pins will not be made if the campaign is unsuccessful. Such is the nature of things, as it would be cruel to birth something unwanted into this strange world. They may in theory find life in a later time, but they would cost more than the amounts presented here. The initial goal for this project is to accrue $300 USD to fund an initial run of pins with additional pins being unlocked should further funding become available. Backers will have the opportunity to choose whatever Strange Object pin they would like, and should you find the items make you uncomfortable you can of course change or cancel your pledge any time during the campaign.



 * The single pin backer option DOES NOT apply to the chandelier. It has it's own option in the rewards because this one is 3x as expensive to make. 
If you have pledged and would like to add a chandelier, add $20 to your existing pledge.
Thank you for understanding."

The secondary is blowing up these receivers today!
Mutant Football League is an NFL Blitz arcade-style football game, with nasty mutants, ferocious monsters, deadly chainsaws, and lots of gory player deaths, along with some edgy, satirical humor that parodies America's favorite sport.
The game is near alpha and fully playable now. We’re planning to release it on the PC in 2017 and then XBox One and PS4 in early 2018.
Give MFL a test drive so you can see exactly where the game is in development. There are some bugs and game rules which are not working correctly (but you will still have fun playing). The User can play a single game against the computer or local multiplayer game against friends (2 to 4 players). Since the game is pre-alpha and not fully tested you may experience some issues based on different PC Configurations. We apologize in advance for any frustration.
 You will need an Official Xbox One or PS4 DualShock Controller to play the game on PC. Keyboard and Mouse are not supported yet.  
PC Requirements
Windows 7 or higher  
Intel Core i3 or better  
nVidia gForce 460 or better (with 1.5+ GB of memory)
4 GB RAM or more
It's not cheating when it's The MFL-approved & officially licensed chainsaw.
Mutant Football League is an action football game where you pick from 14 Unique Teams or 3 All-Star Teams for online or offline gameplay, in solo, co-op, or head-to-head modes. Players can win by scoring more points than the opposition or by literally decimating the opposing team so they have to forfeit. The choice is yours! This is the next generation, spiritual successor to the classic retro game, Mutant League Football with beautiful 3D graphics and impressive gore effects.
Genre:      Sports / Action
Players:   1 to 4 players
Length:     High Replay-ability
Release:   Oct 2017
Languages: English (will add additional languages if there is demand).
Hey, at least he got the First Down!
Online and offline multiplayer for 2 to 4 players - competitive and co-op - so you can laugh at your friends while you crush them under your cleats.
Over the top visual and gore effects include blood splatters, comically horrific deaths, fire effects, exploding body parts, and dismemberment.
Extremely dangerous fields are filled with diabolical traps and hazards – including explosive mines, toxic moats, lava flows and crazed fans cheering on their favorite squad of murderers.
Each team has its own set of twisted audibles such as the classic ""Bribe the Ref"" where you payoff the referee to look the other way, or new additions like ""Chainsaw Massacre"" where your runningback pulls out a league-approved chainsaw and slices and dices the defense into submission, and ""Ginormous” where your blitzer grows 5-times his normal size - have fun trying to block him!
These are your game breaking, wisecracking mutants who have special skills, abilities, weapons; They're players who can single-handedly win you the game. So you’ll need to protect them because nothing hurts worse than losing your favorite all-star to a chainsaw or giant Orc.
DeadHeads are an undead skeleton species who are balanced in all skill rating categories which makes them solid MFL players at almost all positions. Extremely dangerous, skeletons are not afraid of taking a heavy hit because they’re already dead! Being undead also allows skeletons to heal faster than any other character species.
When they were first introduced to the League, most were skeptical about these metallic monstrosities. As technology advanced, corporate teams started acquiring more Robots than any other species.  These updated robots have massive armor and come in different sizes. Some are built for speed, while others are built to withstand large amounts of damage.
Orcs are big, brawny and breath-takingly dumb. Trolls are the most brutal species in the game (meaning they like to kill). What they lack in speed they more than make up for in brute strength, they can be punishing players that inflict heavy damage on opposing players.  With their strength and size, they are perfectly suited be linemen (blockers and blitzers).
More species to be announced soon!
With our initial goal demolished, it’s now overtime for Mutant Football League. This is your chance to expand the game to include new combatants, more bloody thirsty action, and of course a lot more menacing ways to include much more mayhem. Take a look at our Stretch Goals, top up your pledge, and get in while the blood is warm!
In 1993, EA released a monsters-and-mutant sports game called “Mutant Football League,” which became popular amongst gamers and critically celebrated press. Since then, gamers have grown to expect more in terms of characters, environments, animations and gameplay, welcome to the all new, Mutant Football League.
A new beginning ...    
Mutant Football League is a completely new and totally original take on the monster mash-up sports genre, and comes loaded with attitude and comic violence on the playing field. The overall presentation of MFL has been re-visualized from it’s predecessors, but the same sense of urgency that’s an inherent part of a real-world football characterizes our game play. In short, the pacing of our MFL game is on steroids! 
And you thought orcs were big before…
Thanks to fan suggestions and community prodding, we’ve amped up MFL’s humorous moments that can range anywhere from silly, and raunchy to politically incorrect, which our MFL characters have no problem expressing thanks to their over-the-top personal attributes and individual attitudes. You won’t be disappointed with the characters, animations, and overall spirit of our game - unless you’re one of THOSE people.
Digital Dreams Entertainment is an independent game studio, founded by Michael Mendheim and Maxim Novikov. It is an American Company with a development studio in Kiev, Ukraine. The company has developed and released, Murs: hip hop trivia (mobile), the classic 1st person shooter, Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter reborn (PC) and is currently working on Mutant Football League and Cinelinx, a mobile game for people who love movies.

Brian Schmidt is one of the true pioneers of the game audio industry.The 2008 recipient of the Game Audio Network Guild’s Lifetime Achievement Award, Brian has been creating game music, sounds and cutting edge technology since 1987. Brian created the audio and wrote all the music for the original Mutant League Football back in 1993 and we honored to have him on board. With a credit list of over 130 games and a client list including Zynga, Microsoft, Sony, Electronic Arts, Capcom, Sega, Data East, Namco and many others. Brian has used his combined expertise and experience in music composition, sound design and his deep technical knowledge to further the state of the art in game audio and we delighted he is part of the MFL team.
Mutant Football League is a great gruesome, diabolically sinister game of maniacal proportions, but we need your help to finish it.  While there are a few spots that need some more polish, the primary goal of our campaign is to allow us to complete Online Multiplayer mode and then fine tune the rest. 
There are many aspects to the game that we can lovingly improve but we have limited time and resources, so we need to know what is most important to you. We need your feedback and guidance on team balance, play modes, controls, humor, plays & formations, audio, player names, etc. Everyone who purchases the game will be involved in our Beta program.

You’ll be able to play the game and then provide feedback to us, let us know what’s working and what isn’t so we can get every ounce of bloody fun possible. If we’re lucky enough to hit our funding goal, you can help us decide what STRETCH GOALS we should consider too.
We are a small and dedicated team who believe in this project. Since its inception, MFL has been self-funded by the founders of Digital Dreams Entertainment LLC. All money raised for this Kickstarter campaign will go directly toward game production minus reward fees (estimated at 25%).
What Remains to be completed?

59,1710937892,"Iris Divine has found its groove.  Our critically praised Karma Sown set the template with accolades including MetalReviews.com Surprise Of The Month, DPRP.net Album Of The Week and 9.5/10, Sea Of Tranquility 4.5/5, Hard Rock Haven 9/10, NovaMetalReview 10/10, described as ""perfection in fifty minutes"" by Background Magazine, and several 'album of the year' mentions, to name a few.
And now, THE STATIC AND THE NOISE promises to crank up the raw energy and continue the progression.  
Metal fans can rest assured knowing that the drop-tuned heavy guitars and gut-level grooves are intact.  Elements of alternative/ indie rock, industrial and pop add new dimensions to our progressive metal foundation on this record, and every killer riff and hook is balanced by our trademark rhythmic shifts and sense of atmosphere.  
The lyrics dig deeper, and the emotions are intense.  Building on our core lyrical themes of conflict and redemption, we take on political violence, personal empowerment, self deception, painful personal relationships, and other complex manifestations of the human condition.  
The album is 'progressive' not only in the sense of genre, but because we are truly progressing and developing our sound.  Our conceptual inspirations this time around include White Pony, Angel Dust, and other records that take a band's signature sound and add twists to challenge their fans, creating a new statement in the process.  
You can expect the same professional quality production that we achieved on Karma Sown - we are working with Drew Mazurek, Kevin Gutierrez and Brian J. Anthony to deliver a powerful, organic and big sound.  
We've been through some interesting 'firsts' since the release of Karma Sown, including our first experiences with management, a label, and proper PR, as well as a mid-Atlantic/ East Coast mini-tour...  
Which brings us now to THE STATIC AND THE NOISE.  The record will be fully funded by us (and hopefully you!), and we are counting on you to help us make this journey into the next phase of our musical career.
BUDGET:
Recording a great-sounding album, up to our standards, requires significant resources. Interestingly, when a band wants to retain a somewhat organic sound, as we do, it is actually more costly in some ways. Capturing real guitars, played through real amps, and real drums, require real studios and engineers!
When all is said and done, the total budget for the album, inclusive of recording, mixing, mastering, artwork, merchandise, pressing and related costs, will likely fall somewhere between $10,000 and $12,000.  
The Kickstarter goal we have set is extremely modest, considering this, and we have already invested thousands into starting the record.  We hope to meet and exceed our goal, so that this band can complete the record while remaining sustainable and able to move forward.
REWARDS: 
In additional to the standard and popular T-shirts, CDs etc., we have chosen to highlight our approaches to our respective instruments, and various glimpses into the songwriting process that gives Iris Divine its sound.  For all you musicians out there, this is an awesome way to connect and 'talk shop'!!  And, if you wanna create a combo of rewards that pull from different tiers, pitch it to us and we'll try to make it happen! "
60,1801789043,"Hello! We are Mumblecrust Theatre - an Award-Winning Theatre Company from Somerset in the UK. We are raising funds for our brand new production: an adaptation of HG Wells' Sci-Fi Masterpiece The Time Machine!
“Mumblecrust Theatre stand out with their polish and charm” --- Voice Magazine
  • The Show
A Victorian scientist perfects his invention, the world’s first Time Machine! It launches him 800,000 years into the future where he discovers a race of cute creatures the size of teddy bears, frolicking in a dreamlike paradise. Everything is perfect! Or so it seems… In the shadows, eyes watch and creeping feet disturb his sleep. In the future, monsters are very real indeed...
The Time Machine is an absolute classic by HG Wells, the father of modern sci-fi, and it’s crying out for adaptation for stage! We will use the theatrical power of storytelling, puppetry and music in an hour-long family show, with a cast of two. We will design and make a cast of over 20 puppets, including the fluffy, adorable Eloi and the slimy, subterranean Morlocks! We will compose original songs and sound design to immerse audiences in Wells’ world. A cinematic score, composed using top-of-the-line orchestral software, will create a suitably epic backdrop to the story. Something quite unique in touring theatre.
This will be a mobile, touring show, designed to visit mid-scale theatres, arts centres and community halls. Like our last show, our set-design will be striking but simple - packing a visual punch but easy to put up and take down.
And of course, what of the crazy contraption itself, the time machine? Wells’ depiction of time travel is way ahead of its time, so we need to do justice to what, in many ways, is the central character of this story. It’s going to be a beautiful, enormous, eccentric, crazy, Victoriana steampunk contraption, made of brass and cogs and whirring dials.
  • The Task Ahead
The two of us will design, make, write, compose and perform in the show. It may seem like a crazy undertaking, but we've done it once and we will do it again! Audiences love the fact we do so much of this ourselves, it draws them in and inspires them. This has cropped up again and again in our feedback.
“Beautifully designed set and puppets came to life thanks to these insanely talented performers/writers/musicians/puppeteers- they do it all!” --- (Audience Member about The Tale of the Cockatrice)
Photo from The Tale of the Cockatrice - Credit Kirsten McTernan
   • What Your Money Will Do
The money we raise from this campaign will go towards: 
Puppets! - clay for sculpting faces, fabrics and wood/plastics/metals for mechanisms 
Materials for making Props, Set and Costumes  
Any specialist Equipment or Tools required for the above!  
Orchestral Music Software - for the show's cinematic score  
Preliminary Publicity, including professional photos to send to venues  
A tour booker, to approach venues to prebook the show in 2019  
Print costs for Posters, Flyers and Programme
This Kickstarter will ensure that The Time Machine gets made, in one form or another! We will also be applying for additional arts funding. As many of us know, funding can be very competitive as so many amazing projects compete for limited funds. Not only will your support help us financially, it will also help us demonstrate to funding bodies that there is a true demand for our work, that people want to see this show made! This can make all the difference.
Initial Puppet Designs
• How You Can Help Us
Obviously, anything you can contribute to this Kickstarter, however small, will be a great help! If, however, you can't afford anything right now, don't worry! There's still a way to help...
Just share this with your friends on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, Tumblr, Reddit, blogs, websites - you name it! This helps us spread the word which is so important for crowdfunding.
Remember, we can only receive our funds if we reach our goal, so any and all support you can give (financial or otherwise!) will be invaluable to us. Thank you!!
  • Our Experience
Not only have we made one show together already, we've also collaborated on a number of other projects, including satirical music video Tawdry Child, Pinecone Penguin’s King Kong the Musical, puppeteering the Mermaid in Luc Mollinger’s creature feature short Battered and co-directing (and creating puppets for) new musical Heartwood.
Photos from some of our past collaborations
On top of that, we have combined experience and training in puppet making, composing, acting, costume design, social media marketing, sound design, producing, singing, puppeteering, set design and script-writing! We may be a tiny team, but we cover all the bases!
 • Our Supporters
For The Time Machine, we will have advice and mentoring from some amazing Arts Organisations in Somerset. This is fabulous, but it hasn’t always been the case! For our first production, The Tale of the Cockatrice, all we had was a very small Kickstarter campaign. Which goes to show, great things can come from humble beginnings!
After our premiere of Cockatrice in 2016 we teamed up with Niki McCretton at The Lyric Theatre, Bridport to develop the show further. We soon realised how vital outside input and support is, to enrich creativity.
The Time Machine is the first production to be part of Theatre Orchard & Living Spit's Artist Development Scheme ""Shoplifting"", and our rehearsals and premiere will be held at Theatre Shop, Clevedon. Living Spit are an amazing theatre company and their experience and know-how (particularly when it comes to two-hander touring theatre) is going to be invaluable! As well as this, we’re receiving amazing support from Take Art, who are hosting our scratch performance in front of local schools in our area! It’s reassuring to know a lot of talented people have our back as we continue to develop as a company, we feel so grateful."
61,933862915,"Our project lays home on a level part of a 100 acre plot of land home to one of the largest mapped cave systems in the country and we plan to take full advantage of that by using the cave's year around consistent temperature to use the cool air in the summer and warm air in the winter to heat/cool the greenhouse. This layout will drastically reduce the monthly operating costs, as well as making use of the underground water to provide for our aquaponic system.
Currently we have one greenhouse that has been unused for the better part of the last two decades. The greenhouse was pretty over grown with weeds, poison ivy, even some rose bushes and a lemon tree that had managed to survive all these years.
This is what it looked like when we started, Yikes!!
To give a little back story, the property has been in my childhood best friend/ partner's family since the 1970's. With over 22 mapped miles of cave, the property is home to two entrances into the system and sees a multitude of cavers year around, like surrounding boy scout troops and sees travels from as far up north as Michigan and Wisconsin with the majority of cavers from the Ohio area..
This magnitude of cavers and the hospitality of the late Tom and Cathy Crockett has led to an ongoing tradition of ""Caver's Thanksgiving"". This event takes place yearly the weekend following Thanksgiving.
The Progress -
The greenhouse sits beside the main entrance to the cave, which is also where the greenhouse shaft is connected that it gets it air supply from.
We have a mission to create a small aquaponic greenhouse farm to help provide our community with the best possible organic produce that is grown right here fresh and locally.
Break down of where the money is going to be used -
Appalachian Agriculture Dutch Bucket System - 30' x 72' - $3900
250 Gallon IBC Tanks - 150$ each 5 needed - $750
Pumps/Fittings/Pipes to complete Aquaponic tanks - $1,100

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      Total - 5,750
We were fortunate enough that all the fans just needed a little grease to be up and running again. We have tried to include just the bare minimum to get our project off the ground.  Our funding goal is geared toward obtaining enough capital to get our dutch bucket system for our Tomato's and the necessary tanks/fittings/pumps to connect it.
Thank you for taking the time to look at our Kickstarter and we hope to be delivering fresh organic tomato's and other produce to you and our local community very soon!"
62,19832167,"Interior of 1st tote made of plant-based vegan leather
Sure, there are thousands of handbag and accessory companies out there. But how many of them can you make a purchase from and actually feel good about it? Rogan & Ruff is being formed to allow you to do just that. Did you know, second only to oil, the clothing and textile industry is the largest polluter in the world!? In addition to not exploiting animals for fashion, Rogan & Ruff uses all ALL of their responsibly-sourced materials. When we make a handbag, the extra pieces of material become dog collars, leashes, reusable straw pouches and more! So what sort of plant-based materials are we using? Glad you asked!! 

One of our product materials is a brand new, eco-friendly and innovative material called pinatex! This material is made from the husks/leaves of pineapples and made into a non-woven material by the pineapple farmers. How cool is that?! What is even cooler is that this material is durable like leather, but lighter weight and MUCH better for the environment. Very very few U.S. based companies are using this incredible resource and we think that's a shame! Rogan & Ruff wants to use as much of it as possible :) 

We carry the value of our brand throughout everything we do. From being paperless and online, to reduce our carbon footprint, to designing and manufacturing bags in a clean and ethical USA textile factory, purchasing a bag or accessory from Rogan & Ruff, means making a positive impact in the world. 
Currently, Rogan & Ruff has completed branding and a 2-year company plan. The next step relies on you! In order to move to production of the products, we need what are called Tech Packs. These are technical, computer renditions of the bags (and other goods) that allow for the manufacturing process to take place. This, plus the other start-up costs associated with building a company, is what your pledge goes to!!

Rogan & Ruff was inspired by Donna's love of both handbags and animals. Having rescue dogs and cats herself, the line between friend and fashion became increasingly clear, and she knew she had to do something about it. So, with the loss of her corporate job, it was clearly time to pursue the dream: Change the world through fashion, and make sure an animal's place remains by our sides and never on them. 
So began the design of the bag nobody is dying for.
Literally. 
Current project status: 
Our debut line will feature a tote with multiple interior pockets, including a slot for an iPad/tablet, phone holder, key holder, and water bottle pocket, and more! The excess material from creating that tote will be made into matching dog collars and reusable straw pouches! We are all about not being wasteful, being stylish, and practical. 
Our next step is our ""tech pack"" with our manufacturer. The tech pack is the pattern they use to assemble the pieces. It only needs to be done once but is expensive to do, and we don't want to make our bag prices too high that not everyone can afford them. That's where you come in! If everyone donates, even a small amount, the patterns will be forever ours and able to be reused again and again, creating a fair price for the accessories. 
Once the tech packs are funded and created, we move right into manufacturing! Donna has sources beautiful, sustainable materials that will make these products not only stylish and durable, but eco and animal-friendly!
Collar made from ""leftover"" tote materials"
63,1015804153,"    Touching Them, Touching Me - A Love Song for the Dead C is the first in a series of multimedia installation and performance works in which Helga Fassonaki situates herself in the position of a Hagiographer, visually depicting the lives of her musical heroes (deemed saints) - their culture and world that she has incorporated into her own (as fan, artist and musician).  By applying their concepts to her works, she explores her relationship to them and their music via a lens of their own creation. In painting them in an unfailingly positive light, this hagiographic portrayal also touches on bigger ideas of idol worship, the nature of fandom, and sub-cultural mythology - all of which can lead to misguided glorification. But this is a glorification that also leads to a pulsating energy from within, and an urge to destroy in order to create anew.    
     Fassonaki will be exhibiting the first work in the series at Human Resources Gallery in Chinatown, LA and will be needing funds to (A) transform the gallery space into a simulacrum of post-punk 1980’s Dunedin, New Zealand - more specifically, the Empire Tavern, a pub where the Dead C played their early shows and (B) to produce a vinyl record by yek koo (her solo music project) consisting of 5 composed pieces influenced by the Dead C and that explore aspects of their approach.   In conjunction to the exhibition will be a three day performance series called 'Trapdoor Fucking Exit' named after one of the Dead C's most phenomenal albums and featuring artists from the US and New Zealand who have been influenced or inspired by the Dead C.  The performance dates are April 20 - 22 and will take place inside the Empire installation. 
SHOW AT HUMAN RESOURCES GALLERY:
March 24th - April 22, 2012
Opening Reception: Saturday March 24, 2012
3-Day Performance Series: April 20 - 22, 2012
For more information about the gallery check out the Human Resources Website at: http://humanresourcesla.com/
SUPPORT:
All financial support goes directly to helping cover building and production costs:
Mastering, plating, and pressing costs for 'Love Song for the Dead C' Album (300 copies)
Printing costs for 'Love Song for the Dead C' LP - (300 copies)
Building materials (to make the Pub installation)
Installation and labor costs
THANK YOU:
So many people have reached out to help me with this project whether in terms of time, advice, talent, technical expertise, love, support, and/or home-cooked meals.  Thank you for being part of my life - I am so grateful for your generous support of my project. 
ABOUT THE ARTIST:

    Floating between worlds of experimental sound and visual art, Helga Fassonaki approaches each of these worlds with insights gained from the other. Her practice, including her music-performance projects, Metal Rouge and Yek koo, are informed by New York No Wave musicians and their defying of categorization, audience, and convention; the poetic, political and physical chants of Patti Smith; and the raw and damaged sounds of New Zealand’s free noise music of the Le Jazz Non era for stretching the parameters of improvised music.  Informed by such artists and their integration of art and music, she has created sound and art installations, group situations, films, and performances that utilize and question temporality, power structures, subcultures, fan cultures, and the human voice as a crucible for positive transformation.
    Fassonaki's work has been exhibited at UCLA's New Wright Gallery, Elysian Park Museum of Art, and LACE galleries (Los Angeles), Blue Oyster Gallery (Dunedin, NZ), Elam School of Fine Art (Auckland, NZ), Orange County Museum of Art (CA), and California College of the Arts (San Francisco), among others. She has performed in Open Melody Festival at UC Irvine (CA), Ear&Eye Festival (Auckland, NZ) alongside legendary sound artists Akio Suzuki and Phil Dadson, On Land Festival (San Francisco), Human Resources (LA), Public Fiction (LA), and a multitude of other galleries and venues throughout the country. She is also the cofounder of a record label called Emerald Cocoon, which focuses on experimental, psychedelic, and avant-garde music.

""I once shot an elephant in my pajamas. How it got in my pajamas I'll never know.” ― Groucho Marx
        Stand-Up Neurotica´s unique concept relies on both the chemistry and relationships between the characters, and on the novelty of different comedians starring in each episode. The show is currently written as an ""Adult Comedy"" to be aired on a cable network (HBO, SHO, Netflix, Amazon Prime etc.) The show features cursing, vile humor, freedom for each comedian's act and, of course, the occasional hot ""sexual content."" This show will blow your neurotic mind!
               Actors chosen will contribute to the show, the final version, the comic timing, through rehearsal and improvisation.The show will be filmed in classic sitcom style, in front of a live audience to create the energy that only a live performance can bring. The idea is to film the pilot in a small theater  with several ""performances"". The best parts of the each performance can be edited together to make an excellent pilot episode.
        Now, with a show with this much potential, we need a pilot that oozes with professionalism. From what I have researched, $50,000 is a good goal number. With this amount (or more) a true performance can be put on, a comic can be paid, and a wonderful pilot can be produced.
Estimate of Budget Breakdown
Premise                
The plots and subplots revolve around the central characters, the employees of a comedy club. The six of them have become close friends. Other characters may include the club's audience members, family members and passing relationships. A comedian would ‘guest star’ each episode and get a five to seven-minute time slot during which they perform their act. However, no matter how famous the comedian, on the show, he or she is depicted as an up-and-coming performer. 
 Setting                
Club Neurotica is a small, average-looking comedy club in the West Village of New York City. An outside similar to surrounding clubs: walls with peeling posters of adverts, a display case showcasing the upcoming performance, well-worn windows and doors, on a busy city corner. Inside, there is a long bar along one wall, a stage across the room, and about 20 tables scattered around the room. The décor is understated -- posters, candles on tables, a beat-up wood floor and a tin ceiling. 
 Characters: 
  Seth Stevenson: (34)  The manager of the club. He is decent-looking, not model-like. He enjoys his work and chasing women. Seth always seems to be nervous, as though he has forgotten something. He hopes to find the love he once shared with his ex-wife, Julia, for whom he still has feelings. He was devastated when Julia left him after she had an affair with a woman. Their break-up is fresh, under a year, yet they are healed enough to lust after others.
               They try to remain friends and control urges. Seth is getting used to checking out the same women and sharing comments, but he is still getting over his hurt and thinks he will never get over loving her. He has never actually seen Julia with another woman; that is, until the pilot episode, when he sees a lot more than he ever expected to. 

  Julia O'Malley : (32)- Owner of the club and Seth’s ex-wife. Her beauty is a very natural one. Raised in Manhattan, she attended tony prep schools.  She is used to getting what she wants, and likes the finer things in life – upscale mani-pedis, up-to-the-minute fashions, and whatever the New York Styles section touts as “in”. Julia follows the latest in pricy wellness fads—she is currently in the midst of another $350 juice cleanse and recommends it to everyone.   
     Julia’s parents purchased the club when Julia married Seth, who had already been managing the place for eight years. This, Julia thought, would bring them closer together, but it has created and continues to cause friction between them. She knows little about the business of the club but she insists on being involved. 
 Nella Petrini – (48) Nella is short and voluptuous. She is an Italian firecracker; loud, crass, vulgar and honest to a fault. Her look and attitude are evocative of a “mafia wife.” Nobody messes with Nella. She is also intelligent and flirtatious (with special attention to Jaime).
     Later, we come to find out that Nella is married, has a son and older daughter, but she is very guarded about her private life and offers few details. She jokes about the ""wise guys"" from the Arthur Avenue section of the Bronx. (i.e. ""That guy should watch it or he'll end up in a fucking freezer. Of course, we'd need a huge freezer for that fat fuck."",  etc.) However, none of her comments make any reference to actual family and friends, so we are left to wonder.
Cheryl Sonders- (36) A waitress who is beautiful in a slapdash way. She is perpetually in need of a haircut or a new pair of shoes. While she turns heads, many men are turned off by her intelligence and brash feminist views. She graduated with top honors from Fordham University with dreams of becoming a trial attorney; she has a real desire to help women in need.                
     Additionally, she had dreams of having a family, dreams she thought were coming true when she married her college sweetheart. She put off going to law school and had two children with him. But her marriage fell apart due to his drug addiction and his enabling parents. Now she is a single mother with mountains of debt.  She is attending law school (CUNY) part-time during the day. Her concentration is in family law, for which she now has a lot of personal experience.
David Semple- (41) A waiter who feels he is the great representative of the modern gay male population. He is good-looking in an awkward sort of way. David is unfazed by homophobia and unashamed of his sexuality. He has been pursuing a dream of doing musical theater and cabaret-type shows. His singing voice sends chills down one’s spine. He seems a bit arrogant, pessimistic, conceited, selfish, a bit of a hypochondriac, yet quite affectionate                This loving side is revealed in the way he cares for his grandmother. He is the only family member who is in his grandmother’s life and he makes it his business to make her life as comfortable as possible, no matter how much of a pain she is. He also is deeply interested in finding a partner to spend his life with.

Jamie Velez- (30) The bartender, Jaime (pronounced HI-me) is an Hispanic man with model-looks -- a dark complexion, high cheekbones and a lanky, well-muscled build . He is warm and friendly, easy to chat with. Cheryl and he are the best of friends, but Jamie wishes it would develop into more. In fact, he is “head over heels” for her, and when she is near, he finds it difficult to maintain his usual ‘cool’ demeanor. This leads to occasional ""physical comedy"" like that of Charlie Chaplin.
Jamie was born in the Dominican Republic. His mother struggled as a single mother after moving to the United States when he was nine. Jaime has a ten year-old daughter whom he adores and spends as much time with as his job will allow. His devotion to her and commitment to supporting her (he is a bit of a workaholic) make the prospect of a social life difficult. Jaime is also a an avid cartoonist (he adores Marvel comics and manga) and has hopes of one day making his living that way. 

  Muriel Stevenson- (80‘s) David’s grandmother, she is a quintessential Jewish grandmother.  She is always harping on him to better his life, settle down with a “nice girl” (she never accepted David’s sexual orientation), and she stops by regularly to give David his dose of guilt.
Eric Todd- (18) Bar-back, running joke is that he never speaks. He always in the bar reacting to the action, moving glasses, getting beer, cleaning, etc.
Vagrant- (60’s) A man with wild eyes and messy long hair who wears mismatched clothing. He has a raspy voice from too many cigarettes. He also holds an ‘old school’ boom box on his shoulder blaring out classic disco.
Molly- (35) A striking audience member who becomes the object of both Seth’s and Julia’s lust.
Audience members- This show will be best filmed in front of a live audience. Hence, audience members would have a chance to “win a lottery” that would allow them perform as extras during the show.
                                        ""He's Late"" (Pilot)
               The pilot introduces the main characters and places the audience is smack-dab into the middle of a busy night at the comedy club where we find Seth freaking out because a comedian is late. Also:
Seth and Julia fall in lust with Molly, a female customer.

Nella nearly gets into a fistfight with some guy over a parking spot.
David deals with his eccentric grandmother who is still trying to find him a ""nice Jewish girl""
A crazy homeless man comes in the bar.
Cheryl is driving her best friend Jaime crazy with love and
A comedian puts on a show.
And Seth opens the coat closet door to find Julia and Molly nude and on the verge of orgasm.

   Whew!
This ""kickstarter"" for the sitcom pilot Stand-Up Neurotica is the culmination of a dream I have had for many years. I came up with this concept almost 20 years ago and now I am hoping for ""crowd funding"" which, for those of you who don't know, is a way for lots of people to sponsor a big idea and help it come to fruition. So I am hoping YOU, or maybe people you know, may want to be a part of this. Even a few dollars counts! You will NOT get charged unless I reach my goal of $50,000 in 30 days. But NOW is a crucial time. Most projects that succeed get many sponsors within the first week! Then others are more apt to follow. I know I am dreaming big here... But I really think this could be an incredible show!!!
I am hoping that you have enjoyed this introduction to ""Stand-UpNeurotica"" and that you support the making of this pilot. 
Someday is now...
                   THIS IS NOT A DREAM FOR SOMEDAY...  
                                THIS WILL HAPPEN
                                    THIS SUMMER!

Finally, a vibration isolator designed to handle large gimbal systems like the Ronin or MōVI. Take your shots to the next level with smooth tracking movement from any vehicle. 
With the recent appearance of handheld stabilized camera gimbals, the creative movements possible are vast. Attaching these new pieces of technology on vehicles and aircraft opens the door for amazing camera motion control capabilities for prices lower than ever before. However, mounting these devices has proven difficult because of vibrations caused by tires, engines, rotor blades, or any other moving part on vehicles. Jerky movements of the vehicle can also put huge amounts of stress on the gimbals bearings and motors. The Cinema Isolator addresses this problem by utilizing strategically configured wire rope to support the gimbal and allow it to absorb inertial movements. It may seem like wire rope is too stiff for this application, but in reality it offers the perfect amount of compression with a delayed rebound. This is cause by friction between the small metal strands that make up a cable. Below you can see this principle in action on our POV Vibration Isolator. Notice how the lower camera platform stays stationary while the upper platform is experiencing violent vibration. 
Applications
The Cinema Vibration Isolator can be used on practically any vehicle (or just about any moving object) with a grip rigging system in place. The discs are essentially 3/8"" cheese plates. It can also be bolted or strapped to just about anything for use without a rigging system. For easy automotive shots, a roof rack on any car is a great mounting location. Also, dynamic low camera angle shots can be produced by mounting the Cinema Isolator to large R/C vehicles. 
Mounted using standard 3/8"" grip equipment and suction cups
Its wide absorption range allows it to remove high frequency vibrations, while dampening low frequency oscillations. High frequency vibrations can be caused by motors, rotor blades, propellers, and anything that has fast moving parts. These can typically cause rolling shutter or 'jello' issues in the video. Lower frequency vibrations can be cause by a vehicle driving off road, or quick changes in direction. These movements can cause gimbal motors to 'slip' and throw off the stabilization. Also, if the camera is hard-mounted to the vehicle, any jerky moment will create huge amounts of stress on the gimbals bearings which causes permanent damage. The Cinema Isolator allows the gimbal to shift around and therefore reduce stress. 
Compatible Gimbal/Camera Combinations
The Cinema Vibration Isolator can be customized to hold multiple payloads ranging in weight from a MōVI M5 with a BMPCC, all the way up to a Ronin with a RED Dragon and cinema lenses. This is achieved by using different sizes of cable, and removing cable modules. Customers will be able to specify their needs before purchasing. 
Wire modules can be removed for lighter camera systems
 Specifications: 
Weight: 1.27kg                                              
Height: 100mm
Base Diameter: 305mm                                                                                                 
Materials: CNC aluminum, Stainless steel, and G10 fiberboard             
Mounting Options: 3/8"" cheese plate. Holes every 1""                        
Gimbal attachment: The top disc has hole patterns to match the MōVI and Ronin. Other gimbals can be attached by drilling custom holes. 
The Cinema Isolator is perfect for gimbals in the 4 - 13kg (8-28lb) range.
Multiple sizes of wire can be used to increase or decrease stiffness and payload capacity. 
Why we need your help                                                                               
Our first prototype Cinema Isolators used 4 small plates to sandwich the wire rope and hold it steady in the proper configuration. 
This method is cheap and easy to manufacture but adds hours to the build process. Threading the stiff wire through the bolts and plates is EXTREMELY tedious. We have developed a new method that will be much easier, stronger, and less time consuming to build. It consists of aluminum brackets that use set screws to grip the cable ends. The down side is that these brackets require CNC milling, which is expensive to start due to tooling fees. The funds raised in this campaign will be used to help pay for the tooling costs and other manufacturing fees. Once this is accomplished, we will be able to produce large quantities of the product and offer it to our customers at an affordable price. 
This prototype uses bolts to hold the wire in place
Manufacturing Timeline:

68,1186098819,"The Story Behind the Story
This story has been swirling around inside of me for the better part of two decades. I remember being in high school, sitting in my bedroom with my best friend, quietly writing in a notebook while he worked on a project of his own. I read the scene I had written aloud to him. He wanted more of the story. I thought about the characters all the time. I drew maps and created the alphabet of a created language. I worked at a grocery store, and on slow nights, I would print out blank sheets of the receipt tape, and scribble down ideas and conversations between characters in between transactions. I still have that old notebook and all those receipt papers. Through my determination not to let it die, and because of the many friends who continued to ask me about the book, I’m here at the threshold of a lifelong goal: to become a published author.
The World Between
Jamir of Lur-lataer, Priest of The Almighty, is living with a curse. He’ll follow wherever his god directs him to go, but how can he trust in a plan that hasn’t been revealed?
Marina, displaced in time, finds herself confronting a truth she never wanted to learn: she isn’t who she thinks she is.
Jakar of House Arcanan jumped through a portal into the unknown after the woman he has always loved. He won’t leave her, because the future depends on them being together.
Velundovil peels back the layers of time to see everything that has been, and everything that will be. She watches, wishing that there had been another way.
The World Between takes place in a fictional world similar to ours. There are kingdoms with wealthy nobles, cities with sea merchants and towns with humble citizens. There are forests, rivers, mountains and plains. Animal and plant life is like what we would find on Earth and species are named accordingly. This world is a place of magic, though there is disagreement about where it comes from and who can use it. One unique difference is that the world has two suns, one large and one small. Though this is a fantasy novel, absent from the world are other humanoid races such as elves, dwarves, halflings etc. Because the people are not of Earth, their cultures and languages do not exactly mirror those we would find in our world. Groups are more egalitarian in general and there are not many differences between gender roles. The world also has its own pantheon of gods and goddess with religious orders for each.
In writing The World Between, I have tried to incorporate many questions about what it means to be human. My hope is that readers will connect with the key questions that the characters ask themselves throughout the novel: Can I trust in something I can’t see? Is there a calling on my life? Can something good come from something terrible?
Stretch Goals
There are couple of stretch goals for the project and I really hope we can meet both of them.

There seems to be a movement at awards shows where celebrities tell their life stories very quickly and remind people to never listen to the Naysayers and to never, ever give up on your dreams, my show will tap into this sentiment but much deeper. I will interview successful people from all walks of life to learn how they overcame their individual failures and survived their darkest days and learn the tools they used to hold on and to continue through their struggles until they made it big. All for one reason, so that WE the audience can learn from their life lessons and apply some of them to our own lives, because we all hurt in some way.  No one's life is perfect and in talking with these celebrities, the audience will hear the grit and determination it takes to succeed when everyone around you is telling you that you can't. Some wonderful guests would be Rhonda Britten, Will Smith, Eminem, J.K. Rowling, Mike Tyson, Tony Robbins and so many other survivors.  All successful people have failed many times in their lives just like you and I and we will learn from their own words how they hung on during the lowest points of their careers and lives, what coping strategies they used, what tools and techniques they used to stay positive in the face of great adversity until they finally made it big.  My sincerest hope for this show is that someone who is watching will hear some gem of advice and ask for help and begin to heal whatever it is they are battling, because we all have our daily battles, sometimes we just need to be reminded to hold on and to keep fighting the good fight.  That's what Great Lives with Kevin Bungert will be, a daily reminder to hold on and to keep fighting, no matter what!  Thank You...Kev"

https://www.instagram.com/picsnplans/
What is Bullet Journaling? Well, it all started for us at least, with a talented author by the name Ryder Caroll. They are super sweet and you can check out their page below for more info.
https://bulletjournal.com/
We love making customized journals, learning new concepts, and most of all we love sharing our love for journaling with the world. We have seen and met so many wonderful people, and have decided we wanted to start sharing some our creative ideas with everyone.
This Kickstarter is our first step into making our dreams a reality. We have worked super hard in between work, Chosani being a supermom, and a unbearable long commute.
We would love to have you join our Bullet Journal family!
This Kickstarter we are launching our first designs, Pudding the Panda! Our goal, have enough to fund 3 Vinyl waterproof stickers 3""x 3"". I have 2 more designs for stretch goals. If we meet all stretch goals we can upgrade to Holographic/Glitter stickers.
I only listed about 4 tiers to keep the prices reasonable. Of course if you offer more not only will you receive my eternal gratitude, but I may send an extra gift your way. 
Keep your money until we get funded. One cool thing about Kickstarter is that you will not be charged unless we hit goal. During the campaign you can increase or decrease your pledge amount. (But pledging to help us hit $500 enables us to aim for more designs)
Shipping will be sent via USPS first class mail.
If you only contribute a $1 you can still walk away with cool coloring pages to put in your journals/books/etc. (Please do not try to resell, as this would make me very sad.)

The sticker designs are below:
 (All images will be high resolution, I am keeping them low resolution with a watermark so peeps don't take them) 
$600 reached-Design 5 unlocks. Updated picture will be uploaded soon...
700 reached-Design 5 unlocks. Updated picture will be uploaded soon...
 If we reach $800 I can make the stickers holographic!!!
Now these stickers are all going to be 3""x 3"", although resizing may happen. (They will be bigger, since I want to keep the resolution looking nice)
Vinyl and waterproof.
Free thank you sticker surprise in each package. 
Digital download of coloring pages to put into your notebooks, gear, etc.
 September- Kickstarter launches
 October- Kickstarter campaign ends (Surveys are sent out)
 November/December- Stickers are produced and checked for quality
 January/February- Stickers are sent out!
This is an estimated timeline, and any issues with quality may cause a delay. I will be posting updates and keeping everyone in the loop for production.  
Now I understand that these are difficult times and everyone works hard for their money. So if you cannot contribute, I would ask that you share our kickstarter on social platforms. Links will be listed below, or you can share this very Kickstarter page. Please feel free to email me with any questions at picsnplans@gmail.com I will try my best to answer all questions in a speedy fashion.

The REVAMPS Breakout Shield is a drop-in upgrade for 3D Printers who utilize a Ramps 1.4 controller board. Ramps 1.4 is an electronics hardware package that commands all the components of a 3D Printer. Our Shield interfaces with Ramps 1.4 and consolidates multiple inputs/outputs into fewer, simpler and more efficient wire management. When we first started designing a 3D Printer, we incorporated a viable electronics hardware package (Ramps 1.4) that was already a staple in the 3D Printing community.
Stock Ramps 1.4
The main focus was about creating a better 3D Printer than what was available. The electronics were initially overlooked in how they would merge with our initial prototypes simply because the mechanics were our main focus. Heck, we were just excited about 3D printing and not concerned about all the nuances. As designs evolved with Printing and wanting to create better hardware, we faced obstacles with the common 3D Printing hardware. We would be forced to choose other similar electrical packages or enhance what we had. The challenge with creating this additional  Breakout Shield for the Ramps 1.4 eventually enabled us to close the design process for our 3D Printer and hopefully you'll see what it can do for you!
Stock Ramps 1.4 wiring
The above image represents an attempt at trying to tidy up the wiring that almost seems inevitable when working with the stock Ramps 1.4 controller. All wires have to be traced back to the individual pins on Ramps 1.4 which are easy to bend/break, packed in a confined space and easily miswired when setting up a 3D Printer. Best described in the shop as ""Rat's Nest"". 
With our Shield, you are able to consolidate multiple inputs/outputs into fewer, higher quality cabling, eliminating the bulk of the wiring and transforming a 3D Printer into something more reliable, accessible and packed with possibilities.

77,2056556137,"Three hundred years ago, a Bristol man called Edward Teach was the terror of the Caribbean. Better known as Blackbeard, he was the most notorious and successful pirate of his day. Teach’s criminal career came to a sticky end in 1718, but he was by no means the only Bristol sailor involved in piracy. The city also has a strong link to fictional pirates. Long John Silver from Treasure Island owned a pub in Bristol. In addition, literature’s most famous castaway, Robinson Crusoe, was based on Alexander Selkirk who came to Bristol after his rescue and there met Daniel Defoe. Woodes Rogers, the Bristol-based captain who rescued Selkirk, was a privateer who preyed on Spanish shipping. He later became Governor of the Bahamas and a scourge of pirates.
A few years ago Wizard’s Tower produced Airship Shape and Bristol Fashion, an anthology of steampunk stories set in and around Bristol, and written by local authors. It did very well, so I wanted to do something similar for the local writing community. When I began to think of a follow-up, pirates immediately came to mind. Everyone loves them, and there is a strong Bristol connection.
However, in thinking about the book it became obvious to me that it could not just be about Bristol. Our pirates didn’t ply their trade in the city; they did so far away across the sea. Most famously they did so in the Caribbean. Any book about pirates, therefore, should not just be about Bristol, but about the Caribbean too, and should involve people from the Caribbean.
Fortunately I happen to know quite a few excellent Caribbean writers of speculative fiction. Some of them have kindly agreed to write for this book. I’m hoping to work with them, and with my colleagues at Ujima Radio, to reach out to budding writers from the Caribbean, and to writers of Caribbean descent living in Bristol.
Although we do have some writers already signed up, the book will be open to submissions, assuming we achieve our funding goals.
Given the nature of speculative fiction writers, I am sure that people’s imaginations will rove far and wide. The book will contain stories about pirates, but some of them may ply their trade in the South China Sea, or in deep space, or with the help of a friendly dragon. All that we ask is that the stories should be about piracy, and that either the story or the writer should have some connection to Bristol and/or the Caribbean.
As for you readers, splice the mainbrace! Or have something non-alcoholic if you prefer. Then patch your eye, map your treasure and buckle on your parrot (dead or alive). It is time to take the Seven Seas, no matter where in space and time they might be found.

At £15,000 we'll add some essays about pirate history.
At £20,000 we'll produce hardcover editions of Piracity (and add extra reward levels so you can order them).
At £25,000 we'll pay our writers, editors and other contributors more."
78,1900427666,"Tomorrow's Doctors are only going to be as good as how well educated they are today. 
In Medical school we are mainly left to fend for our self. We have books thrown at us with the expectation of knowing them inside out, without any real walk-through or explanation. Leaving most students to struggle, mundanely memorize and never really understand the actual medical importance of the practices that could save someones life. 
Yes is the answer to your question if you are asking yourself right now 'Is this happening to the doctor that might be trying to save my life one day'. 
I hope to create an online user interface where students in later years of education can provide help and tuition to their fellow medics in the years below. This will allow them a service where they can selectively choose how and by who they want to be educated by, giving them the freedom of being able to learn in the way they can best.  
In medicine experience is key, giving people the opportunity to be taught by someone who has went through the same hurdle not long ago is the most effective way to mold brilliant Doctors who can go on the use that knowledge to help and save people. 
For this project to become possible: I will need capital to set up the website and maintain it as well as to market the idea and increase the awareness of it amoung the student community. 
A crowd funding website is last place I expected myself to be But I know I can not do this alone. This is not just important for me or future Doctors, it is important for everyone because the education we invest in today will be the result we receive tomorrow. 

I believe this will make a difference. It will allow doctors to study with passion and not just pressure and who knows it might even save someones life; YOU might even save someones life.
I urge everyone to PLEASE help me make this dream possible. For a better future, for all of us. 
Thank you."
79,327382368,"Thank you for visiting my Kickstarter campaign to launch my book - The PS Vita: Year One. To summarise the premise, it’s an unofficial look back at the events of the Vita’s launch and its first year on the market and how those events defined the rest of its life.
Images and text not final.
About the book
The Vita struggled to make an impact on the game market but it found its audience of loyal fans (including myself) that continued to support it long after Sony stopped releasing games for the system. In this book, I take a look back at the launch of the Vita and its first year on the market. The Vita was labelled a “failure” just months after its launch. There were many reasons for this and I intend to explore the highs and lows of the Vita’s first year and how its performance and the negative reputation it obtained, continued to define the Vita for its life.
You can’t talk about the Vita’s launch without also discussing Nintendo’s 3DS and how a series of smart decisions from Nintendo (coupled with some bad decisions from Sony) sunk the Vita early on. The book will be broken up with retrospectives on some of the games that had the biggest impact (both positive and negative) on the system’s reputation.
The book will be A5 size and currently I’m targeting a length of 80-100 pages. It will include the history of the PS Vita and at least 10 game retrospectives. The following game retrospectives are currently planned:
Gravity Rush. 
Escape Plan 
Call of Duty: Black Ops: Declassified
Motorstorm RC
Uncharted Golden Abyss
Persona 4 Golden
LittleBigPlanet Vita
Sound Shapes
FIFA Football & FIFA 13
Need for Speed: Most Wanted. 
I will potentially add more depending on time and whether the kickstarter meets its stretch goals.

About me
My name is Sandeep Rai, also known as 2 Old 4 Gaming on Twitter and YouTube. I have been a gamer for most of my life. I have fond memories of sitting in front of the TV and playing my NES with my brother, but as an adult I’ve found handheld gaming just suited my life more. The PlayStation Vita, with its varied library of games and portability, has been my device of choice when it comes to gaming. Writing a book about the game’s industry is not something I have experience in doing, I’m more used to writing business reports in my day job! My passion for the Vita and its games inspired me to not only write this book but also to start my YouTube channel where I bring reviews and gameplay impressions of the latest PS Vita games.
Contributors
The book is being edited by Michael Rupprecht, Spencer Pressly and Adam Cartwright. Michael is the editor of Handheld Players. Michael brings a lot of experience in covering the Vita for years through his website and YouTube channel. He has owned a Vita since its launch and is a loyal fan of the handheld. Adam has his own site reviewing and commenting on Vita games (kresnik258gaming.wordpress.com) and is a guest writer on VGChartz and the Vita Lounge. Spencer has written for various sites in the past including Gaming Union. Now he mainly spends his time collecting for the Vita and creating a podcast called Shin Megami Tensei Network covering all things SMT/Persona.

Why Kickstarter?
As someone trying to launch an independent book, Kickstarter is a great way to drum up attention and also to gauge demand. I am also hoping that I could leverage a successful kickstarter for interview access with developers of some of the year 1 games.
Why Year 1?
I have been asked why not have the book cover the life to date of the Vita. There are a few reasons for focusing on the Vita's first year. Postage costs for international shipping are quite expensive. I am aiming to keep the weight of the book under 250g to avoid postage costs becoming ridiculously high. To try and fit the entire life of the Vita into a book of that size would be limiting. I would prefer to have the space to properly focus on this very important period in the Vita's life and be able to have detailed retrospectives on some of the big games from that first year. If the book turns out to be a success with a positive reception from the Vita community, I would like to consider making it a series of books focusing on each year of the Vita's life.
Images and text not final.
How will I use the funds?
I will be using all of the funds of a successful kickstarter to print the books. Assuming the project is fully funded, I will be able to have enough copies of the book printed to fulfil the orders of my kickstarter backers and to send copies to some games sites/YouTubers to help promote the book. After the kickstarter, the book will most likely only be sold digitally due to the printing costs for small runs making it not feasible to fulfil smaller orders.
When will the book be available? 
I am targeting completion of the book by the end of October 2018. It’s a conservative target and I’d hope to be done sooner but I just don’t want to over-promise and under-deliver.
Images and text not final.
Stretch Goals 
As someone working on this book independently, I am not able to promise a variety of physical rewards, instead my stretch goals will involve adding content to the book.
£2,000 - Additional game retrospective.
**NEW** £3,000 - Digital ""Director's Cut"" of the book for any one that has backed a reward tier that includes a digital version. It will include additional content (please see backer update for details).
£4,000 - Additional game retrospective.

81,1535346832,"The Band:
Kill The Moment is a Norwegian Metal band established in 2010. KTM has four members with different background's but share a common passion. Our passion is simply the joy of playing music and be together as friends doing what we love the most. We play melodic guitar based music, with integrated elements like punch and groove. KTM is influenced by bands like: Trivium, In Flames, Lamb Of God, Judas Priest and Mastodon to name a few. What keeps us motivated is our starvation for musical perfection and the lust of sharing what we love to the people. KTM has won a competition for best live act during the event ""Nattrocken"" In 2011 And recently passed through to the finals of the: Metal To The Masses competition in Norway, which will be held 16 of may where the battle continues to get a live slot at the biggest English indi festival: Bloodstock. KTM consists of:
Eirik Ravn Waldeland - Bass
Willy Nordbø - Guitar/Vocal
Svein Olav Kaurin - Lead Guitar
Martin Hansen - Drums
See you on the road!
- Kill The Moment
The Album:
KTM have around 13 songs that could be considered for an album, now we need you to make our dream come true! Making an album has been the members of KTM wish for years and finally we feel that the time is right and musical material is sufficient. Now we want to share what has been giving us our musical satisfaction and motivation with you. First things first, lets put all the facts on the table: making an album is highly expensive, espessially for an unsigned band were all the funds have to come from your own pockets. some of us are students and some have only part time jobs. Still we dont want to contain what has been giving us all this joy, we want people listening to what KTM is all about, that is why we need your help. What KTM has put as our budget on kickstarter is infact not even half of what just recording and mixing costs, we still need mastering and burning our music to CD's and Vinyls. This however we will manage to pay ourselfs through hard work and time. What idea the album is based on and the meaning behind its theme will not however be revealed before its completed, its fun to spare some details and let the imagination flow. We hope that you will help us fund our album, hopefully it will be in your shelf by the end of the year!
The Plan:
Estimated price of recording/mixing the album is 7,500 $ Using an studio engineer/producer by the name of: Endre Kirkesola, who works at Dub Studio in Norway. He has worked with bands such as Chrome Division, Immortal, Blood Red Throne to name a few. We feel that this guy could help us make the album sound as it should be sounding, Heavy, in your face and melodic, capturing what is the sound of KTM. the plan is to start recording after the summer holidays and hopefully have the product finished by the end of the year. If we make our goal on kickstarter, we are in buisness to portray the new era of metal!
Our Gratitude:
We would like to take this opportunity to thank you for either reading about us or checking up on us. If you did not like the music/shows we would like to thank you for listening to it and giving us a chance. We hope that you have a great experience listening to our music or seeing us play a live show, just as much as we love doing it!
From all of us: thanks!"

83,858042332,"What is The Glebe Exhibit?
The Glebe Exhibit is a collection of artworks created by Mick, Matt, and Kathy Glebe: where every piece is authentic, iconic, and carefully created in great quality to take you on a journey of historic exploration and unique investment opportunities. The idea is simple: For the past decade we have illustrated amazing pieces of art leading up to this personal project. Over the years, we have had the pleasure of working on officially licensed properties for Marvel Entertainment, LucasFilm, DC Entertainment, and countless others. we are looking at expanding our creative works into our own original fine art collections, this would include having a brick and mortar gallery: The Glebe Exhibit. Through helpful funding of Kickstarter, we would host our own brick and mortar gallery, as well as maintaining it’s online counterpart at Twynsunz.com.  
The Glebe twins are a rare case of identical mirror twins (left and right handed artists).
Why invest in The Glebe Exhibit?
The first collection of artwork in this Kickstarter is themed around the Titanic—one of the most iconic shipwrecks in human history. We will be offering a unique opportunity to invest in not just our gallery and artwork—but history itself with a major incentive we will be including: authentic free coal raised from the wreckage of the Titanic. This coal will be included with specific rewards only.
Our theme’s mission in our gallery will also help promote and educate the historical significance of such a personal connection shared with the doomed ocean liner—through the artwork and preservation of it’s memory. Something we will continue through future themes presented in the success of this gallery being funded and built. 
Both online and with private showings, this showcase will feature original fine arts—curating paintings, sculptures, and other mixed media creations, spanning the imagination or historical contexts. Our plan is to maintain and establish our on-going website for the gallery, as well as the brick and mortar location physically of the private gallery. Generous pledges will also go towards materials and supplies needed to create these fine works of art: pencils, paints, and canvases to keep the passionate heart of art beating. And through this Kickstarter campaign, investors will have the chance to own or collect some of these original pieces! Many of which will be featured for a limited time in the gallery’s exhibition. Funding would also go towards the promotion of the gallery along with its building to attract savvy would be patrons.
The Original Paintings
“Into The Abyss” 
is an original concept illustrated and painted in traditional-mixed medium on a high-quality 22X30 inch illustration board. The mediums include: acrylic, watercolor, colored pencil, pen, ink, and markers. This piece is based on research theories of how the bow section (front half) of the RMS Titanic came to rest on the bottom of the Atlantic ocean. Study suggests the bow section measures approximately 470 feet long. Traveling at approximately 25 mph at a 45 degree angle, the bow section plunged into the sea floor—burying itself 60 feet into the mud. The foremast was torn down, falling onto the port bridge, along with the ship's wheelhouse being swept away. This haunting image illustrates the dark descent of the doomed ocean liner meeting its final resting place in the early hours on the morning of April 15th, 1912. The discovery of the wreckage came 73 years later by Robert D. Ballard and a team of reachers in 1985. The weight coupled with the speed that impacted upon an abrupt halt left this forward section of the ship badly damaged to which Ballard described “as if it had been squashed by a giant’s fist.” Despite the exterior’s condition—the bow’s descent and collision with the ocean floor still left this section in reasonably good condition—being slowly flooded created a relatively smooth descent mitigating the interior damage. In the grim distance of this artwork, a clouded settling of the imploded stern section (back half) can be seen falling into the debris field. On a personal note, to our knowledge, no other artist has captured this terminal impact concluding her final resting place.
“The Sinking Maiden”
is an original concept illustrated and painted in traditional-mixed medium on a high-quality approximately 19X30 inch illustration board. The mediums include: acrylic, watercolor, colored pencil, pen, ink, and markers. This piece depicts the beginning of the RMS Titanic’s descent into the Atlantic ocean in the hours of its sinking between April 14th—15th 1912. It’s final resting place became 12,500 feet beneath the ocean surface, leaving behind two debris fields covering 2 square miles separating the bow and stern sections that broke apart during the sinking—both sections are located 1,970 feet apart. The stern’s remains measure approximately 350 feet long and is almost unrecognizable, as it was catastrophically damage during it’s final descent. Survivors recounted hearing explosions seconds after the stern sank beneath the watery surface—air pockets imploding, coupled with the frigid temperatures and heated boilers literally caused the stern section to explode and disintegrate upon it’s descent. This artwork displays both the beauty of human achievement and tragic loss of life in this historical event. 
The Coal
Through this artistic Kickstarter patrons will have the unique opportunity to obtain coal that was retrieved from the debris field of the Titanic’s wreck. More than 80,00 clumps of coal that served as the blood of the world’s most famous ocean liner has been inventoried by weight and quantity with certification, import number, and date by the United States Customs Service as having been recovered from the Titanic. All of this is reflected and verified in it’s accompanying certificate of authenticity. This particular item is not only a small piece of history, but is growing more scarce with the passage of time, it is the only item allowed to be sold to the public. Each piece of coal we’ve curated for this Gallery’s Titanic Themed Exhibition has acted as “effort conservators” to Titanic’s deteriorating remnants; and these original keepsakes (keychain or coin) come as absolutely FREE incentives with our top-tier pledges.
The Relic Box
Our original hand-crafted Relic Boxes are the heart of this exhibit, embodying a miniaturized experience for investors and collectors. Each uniquely packaged exhibit come with the perfect set of conversation pieces for this exhibition. Everything about this part of the exhibit has been hand-finished and will be unique to every investor. Adorning the top is a sculpted replication of the Titanic’s bow wreckage, infused to the box as if it were raised from the depths of her final resting place. The interior of this showcase has a classy lid-support, with a miniature concept sketch that greets the opener under the lid. A faux leather liner caresses the bottom of it’s contents replicated within, the wood has been stained to meet it’s elegant presentation. Each box will include these original keepsakes: 2 canvas card reproductions of each of the main paintings, 1 original ink sketch card in the theme of Titanic, 1 replicated passenger contract Titanic ticket, 1 romanticized jewelry necklace embellished with Glebe artwork, and 1 free authentic coal keychain with its certificate of authenticity. Everything comes autographed and numbered in the collective Relic Box pledges. The Relic Box itself can be purchased individually in a separate pledge tier. 
3D ARTiFact Cards
 Each ARTiFact Card comes hand-sculpted and painted as if it were still resting somewhere in the darkness of Titanic’s debris field at the depth of 12,500 feet in the frigid waters of the North Atlantic. With each of these pieces being based on actual items salvaged from her wreckage, our artistic interpretation of these will be 1 of 1 recreations, crafted through a mixed medium process to replicate either the bell that was rung in Titanic’s fateful moments—or to something as personal as the pocket-watch a passenger carried with them on that ill-fated maiden voyage. These wooden-backed mini-masterpieces are replicated on a smaller scale and come in a sealed display case to protect the original art for years to come. The custom backs come signed and numbered; they can be purchased through individual or together pledges. 
Canvas Cards
Our canvas cards are exclusively produced for the Relic Box. These miniaturized reproductions of the main paintings come beautifully captured on 2.5x3.5 inch heavy-weight canvas stock, with a custom back that is signed and numbered. The two paintings are the face of The First Glebe Exhibit, capturing the dramatic final moments of the Titanic’s sinking, and her final decent as she crashed 60 feed in the mud and murk of the ocean floor.
Personal Sketch Cards
These mini-masterpieces are what we are known for! All originally hand painted and drawn in full color, we capture the vision of a commission for our clients. With this unique pledge patrons will be open to commission us in the gallery theme of the Titanic, or outside subject matter original to their own ideas. And yes, we can illustrate you like one of our “French girls.” Each PSC comes on a 2.5x3.5 inch heavy-weight card stock and custom back.
Original Ink Sketch Card
Our ink sketch cards come exclusively to the Relic Box, adding a sense of nostalgia and original art to the collection. Each ink card will be executed in the theme of the Titanic, covering everything from faces of the passengers, the captain, relics and scenes, as well as the ship herself in various stages of her life. Each card is illustrated strictly in back ink on aged paper, the wooden stock cards come with a custom back where they are signed and numbed—unique and in correlation to each Relic Box sold in the corresponding pledge tier. 
Replicated Passenger Contract Titanic Ticket
Exclusively replicated for our Relic Box, this third-class ticket was originally submitted into the national archive of the United States district courts; used as evidence during the investigation of Titanic tragedy and it’s massive loss of life. The highest percentage of victims were steerage, or “third cabin” passengers, who were mainly poor immigrants coming to start a new life in America. 
The Titanic Necklace
 This special keepsake was crafted by artist and designer Kathy Glebe. Capturing a beautiful rendition of our artwork on a wooden token and flanked by a starry metal backing, this piece is sure to generate interesting conversation to a classy look or a unique gift item. The Glebe Titanic Necklace is available in both gold or silver tone chain and charm. This elegant keepsake can be obtained in the collective Relic Box pledge tier or the Titanic jewelry (with matching earrings) pledge tier. 
The Prints
One of our most popular base products, our prints come in a plethora of collection options and pledge tiers to serve your collector needs! Whether you’re buying for your own curation, or to share as a gift with others, they will capture “Into the Abyss” and “The Sinking Maiden” in all their high-definition glory. The 11x17 inches poster prints pledge come signed and numbered to 1,912 available world wide, making them the more limited and sought after collectable of the print options."

After an Introduction, about the music revolution of the sixties, we will take up lyrics as the key to the meaning of our music. We rarely try to think through the meaning of our songs, though amazing things, and occasional treasures, can be found there. Our course will also involve psychology, a study of love, and conclude in a discussion with Allan Bloom. The work is now in a final editing, and will be self published, perhaps through Mill Stream Publishing company.

Why a Raspberry Pi 3 instead of a Pi Zero?
By using a Raspberry Pi 3 instead of the much less powerful Pi Zero, you will have much greater capability such as playing many retro console games that will not run on the Pi Zero.  Furthermore, the integrated Bluetooth, WiFi, and full sized HDMI and USB ports eliminate the need for you to purchase the multiple adapters and extensions required for a Pi Zero system.  
What about Heat?
The Raspberry Pi 3 is known for overheating under heavy CPU loads. This problem is solved by integrating a cooling fan that is small enough to fit inside the cartridge and provides adequate airflow.  The fan keeps temperatures low even when running benchmark programs that max out all four processor cores for an extended period of time.  Cooling vents were integrated into the mounting bracket face so no holes need be cut into the cartridge itself.  A heatsink will also be provided with every kit.  You can feel confident that your Raspberry Pi will not overheat no matter how heavily you load its processor.  
How can a Raspberry Pi 3 fit into an NES Cartridge?
To get the Raspberry Pi 3 into the NES Cartridge it is necessary to remove the Ethernet port and the double stacked USB ports from the circuit board.  The integrated WiFi on the Raspberry Pi 3 all but eliminates the need for an ethernet port, and two USB ports are relocated to the face of the mounting bracket.  A driving factor in the design of this project was to keep the exterior of the NES cartridge unmodified so as to maintain the stock appearance of your cartridge.  However, it would be possible to cut slots into the side of the case and install two more USB ports if you need all four ports.  
What if I don't have the time, ability, or interest to build a project that requires soldering?
No problem!  Let me build your Pi3Cart for you.  Check out the assembled pledge level.
Thank you for checking out this project!
I have had a great deal of fun developing and building the Pi3Cart and want to share it with others.  I have built multiple Pi3Carts which I have shared with friends and family who love them.  Mine has become an integral part of my home entertainment system and makes a great conversation piece.  By selling kits on a pre-order basis I can order wholesale quantities of parts and reduce the kit cost, so that I can share the Pi3Cart with the world.  "

We are staging a gender-inverted, film noir-inspired musical production of Shakespeare's Taming Of The Shrew, at the New Wimbledon Studio Theatre, running 26th May - 20th June 2015.  But to truly make this dream a reality, we need your help.
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
Q:  Who are Arrows & Traps?
A:  We are a new London-based, non-profit, repertory theatre company made up of actors, puppeteers, clowns, choreographers, film makers, designers, and musicians - a diverse group of people with a vast array of different talents and experience, all united in our passion for re-inventing classic texts for modern audiences.  Our past work includes two critically acclaimed productions of Much Ado About Nothing and The Winter's Tale in 2014 at the Lion and Unicorn Theatre, and our next production is an epically gory Titus Andronicus in October 2015, but we're not limited to solely producing Shakespeare.  We have several esteemed patrons such as the master of the lexicon, actor and presenter Gyles Brandreth, as well as Olivier Award-winning West End actor David Bedella. 
Put simply, our mandate is to put on the best night's live theatre you can get for under £20.  We take an old tale, and we tell it in a way you've never seen before.  Our work is bold, it's unusual, it's unafraid of taking risks.  We've had a phenomenal first year, and cannot wait to show you what we've got planned next with Shrew.
""Exit pursued by a bear"" - The Winter's Tale 2014
Q:  What's so different about your production of Taming Of The Shrew?
A:  One of the main things that makes our show unique is that it is staged as a play within a play, where the roles and lines are swapped in a full cast gender inversion; which means every single character in the story has to be completely re-invented from scratch.  This is not the Shrew you know.  It will draw you into a world run by a matriarchy, where sons are sold off by their mothers to the highest bidder, where husbands are dragged off screaming by their wives; a world where women make the big decisions, and their men must live with the consequences.  This, for us, is our biggest excitement  - as it will allow our actors access to roles that they would never normally get to play, and as a team we will discover how this changes a tale we all think we know.  It's a love story of rebels, running from a world of rules and expectations, Shrew is often called ""a battle of the sexes"", but we are interested in what happens to that battle when the tables are turned.
Offie-Nominated Actress Elizabeth Appleby as Hermione in The Winter's Tale (2014)
Q:  Why did you choose to switch genders around?
A:  We certainly didn't take this decision lightly, and see it as far more than just a gimmick.  First of all, and this is quite important if you want your play to be entertaining (which we do), when you turn the Shrew (Katherine) into a man, and her tamer (Petruchio) into a woman, you instantly inject back some of the fierce humour that Shakespeare originally intended, which modern audiences arguably struggle to find sometimes.  But more than this, we wanted find out what happens when you take a story of female powerlessness and male dominance, and flip it completely on its head.  Is it still cruel?  Is it still a love story?  Is it worse now that a woman is doing the taming?  Is it more palatable now that the victim is a man? 
We want to explore male helplessness, to question what would make a man be deemed by society as ""shrewish"", and how would a conservative and oppressive society resolve that.  We want to find out what a female society is like when it hasn't had to deal with male validation.  We even want to explore the issue of a particular form of domestic violence that is often ignored or trivialised, namely when it is a man who is the victim.  We want to find out whether love can survive in a world that is revolving about wealth and worth, and how truly you can ever really know another person when everyone around you is pretending to be someone else.  In short, we want to give the Shrew back its teeth.
Much Ado About Nothing (2014)
 Q:  Is it still Shakespeare?
A:  Absolutely.  The text is a slightly cut-down version of the original, running at just over 90 minutes.  Shakespeare's words are still here (except for his choices of pronouns of course), and we want, above all, to stay true to his intentions.  But we think this is a version of the story that he would have approved of.  He was an adaptor, he took well-known myths and stories, and he made them his own.  We think he wrote to make people think about the world they lived in, to question whether love can ever triumph over all, to investigate how much we are defined by our parents' opinions of us, to argue over whether a true rebel's heart can ever truly be tamed, or rather is it quietened only when it is understood?  This is a play that Shakespeare wanted to create debate with, and we think somewhere along the line our collective modern sensibilities have blocked our sightline to this.  The only way then is re-invent it to the point where we can experience it again like new.
Q:  Where does my money go?
A:  There are no fat full coffers in our production company.  We do this for the love.  We work in day jobs, teach, wait tables, give out flyers, drink too much coffee, have fever dreams about lost props or forgotten lines, think constantly obsessively about Shakespeare, and never want to change a single minute of it.  Anything you give will go directly into making the show happen.  It will buy costumes for our leading ladies, props for our clowns, an hour's rental of a rehearsal studio; every single penny will be driven straight back into making this our best show yet. 
The heart of our production are our actors, we'd be nowhere without them, so a large portion of any donations we receive will go towards a fair and honest wage for their hours of hard work.  And we're not talking hundreds of pounds a day and their own trailer filled with blue M&Ms here, we're talking about the basic minimum wage in the UK.  There are, of course, other vital things that the productions needs, as nothing comes for free, but it is our hope that we can raise enough money to both satisfy the vision that our production team has, as well as offering the fair rate that the cast deserve.

I love drawing vkei bandmen and thought it would be nice to have pins of some of their guitar designs. Making merch takes a lot of time/money especially for the vision I had so I'm launching this page for people who have the same interest to help me reach my goal.   
I want to make a set of  4-6 (maybe more) hard enamel pins of my favorite jrocker's guitars: Kaoru (Dir en Grey) hide (X) Uruha (theGazettE) etc.! Most of the funds will go into paying for production of the mold which is the most expensive for the size I want them to be: 8cm, coming out to almost $100 USD for each. They will each come wit two tacks and metal securing nubs on the back. If this project goes well I would also be excited to make more stretch designs to expand the collections. 
Here is the chart information supplied to me by the manufacturer with the material and and prices for the mold. All of them will come out to be about the same price.

If you have suggestions for other guitar designs you want to see added please please feel free to send a message whenever you'd like!!

89,186321733,"TRU’Nation was developed at Park University in Parkville, Missouri, as a result of studying and implementing Park University’s commitment to its core values of inclusivity, global citizenship, and accountability. TRU’Nation is a spiritually-based organization, designed to empower youth and to engage the community. Its purpose is to help disadvantaged and socio-economically challenged adolescents and young adults achieve success in the world, both during and after their college careers. In this proposal, I will illustrate the need for such a venture by first providing research-based evidence on why TRU’Nation is both a worthy investment and a powerful change-agent for society as a whole. Then, I will illustrate my strategic three-step process on how TRU’Nation will be collaboratively developed and implemented. Finally, I will use comparative data on why I believe TRU’Nation will be successful and provide goals with measurable outcomes to demonstrate how TRU’Nation will show evidence of achievement to investors. TRU’Nation is a collaborative venture designed to support adolescent students (in high school and college) achieve success by providing them with resources to meet basic needs. Often, students from disadvantaged backgrounds are worried about not having enough food to eat, school supplies, transportation and medical support. In addition to lacking basic resources, many of the disadvantaged youth who live in high crime areas tend to avoid public places, because they fear being harmed. This unsafe and exclusive lifestyle prevents our disadvantaged youth from developing and growing both cognitively and socially, which can inhibit their ability to achieve success in college as well as prevent assimilation into society. Museums, parks and other educational opportunities are often frequented by families and individuals who live and work in safe, financially stable communities. The disadvantaged youth in our area are prohibited from these wonderful and educationally stimulating opportunities, because they cannot access the areas due to safety concerns and lack of financial resources. TRU’Nation is designed to change that, to develop an inclusive and globally-responsive program, which incorporates not only meeting the basic needs of our disadvantaged youth, but also developing them into becoming culturally and socially-responsive, high-achieving citizens."

The Farm Lab at Petty Ranch Education Program
Farm Lab
SEEAG believes food literacy should be a right not a privilege. Agricultural education should be free to all kids. With your generous support, SEEAG's Farm Lab at Petty Ranch Education Program will be 100% cost free and will enable our organization to educate thousands of kids about the importance of agriculture and the science behind healthy farm ecosystems.
Our goal is to provide over 4,000 school children with cost-free outdoor education during the 2016-17 school year. Reaching our $25,000 will provide: 
School bus transportation
Farm Lab supplies 
The creation of a mobile farm-to-food classroom, which will provide direct access to a science-based agricultural lab on school premises.
If our Kickstarter campaign reaches the $25,000 goal, SEEAG promises to educate over 4,000 students. That's only $6.25 per student.  
Sample of some program costs:
School bus transportation - $250 per bus x 67 trips = $16,750 for 4,000 students total
Large outdoor classroom shade tent (army tent) - $2,500
Tuff Shed for storing supplies - $3,500
Observation beehive - $500
Compost storage bins - $500 x 3 
Worm bins - $250
Even with America's rich agricultural heritage, children fail to make the connection between the acres of farmland to the food on their tables. SEEAG's 100% cost-free Farm Lab Education Program helps make that connection. SEEAG opens children's eyes to the meaning of agriculture, and creates conscientious consumers, agricultural ambassadors, and future stewards of family farmland. 
The program teaches kids that healthy soil = healthy plants = healthy animals/insects = healthy people.
Furthermore, there is currently no national food literacy curriculum that teaches kids about the farm origins of food. SEEAG teaches the next generation to care about farmland, farms, farmers, and our agricultural workforce who work very hard everyday to make sure we have food on our tables. Our program instills pride in our youth whose family members are already an integral part of the food system.
SEEAG has taught over 15,000 K-12 students since 2008, and we want to reach more! 
Through the support of people like you, we are able to provide a 100% cost-free program to underserved schools. Our goal is to expand our scope of work with the new Farm Lab at Petty Ranch. We need funds to provide free school-to-farm transportation and Farm Lab materials, including a mobile farm-to-food classroom, which will provide direct access to a science-based agricultural lab on school premises.  
Your help will make a difference in the lives of 4,000 children.  
Thank you for your support. 
Sincerely,
Team SEEAG
Letters from kids are the best testimonials
We hope to reach our goal by October, National Farm to School Month

 Stretch Goals
Upon on meeting our initial goal, we went through the feedback we received during the campaign so far and looked at what we could build on top with the extra funding that would be both within the scope of the project, and would support the requests we received. Here are the Stretch Goals for the campaign so far:
Stretch Goal #1 - Accelerate PlayStation 4 support. ✅
 Stretch Goal #2 - 50 more challenges in the Early Access. 🔲

Antstream as a company has been in existence since 2014, but the first line of code dates back to 2008!  It started as a bedroom project for Steve Cottam, who is the CEO and founder.  One of the original anecdotes that drove this idea was noting how at gaming / entertainment conventions the arcade cabinet running something like Pong would be the biggest draw every time!  He realised then that retro was cool, it was desired, but it was not easily accessible…and so Antstream was born.
Obviously Steve has needed help along the way, and the team you see have a wealth of experience and credits to their names.  The team is made up of poly skilled engineers who cover a wealth of programming languages covering classic and modern computing environments, as well as infrastructure engineers, and operations experts.  Not to mention content and licensing specialists, and UX consultants to make sure everything works together to provide a good user experience, which is after all what Antstream is all about.  The team have written games/worked for companies like Nintendo, Sega, Atlus, Square Enix, Ocean, and Konami, as well as more than a dash of the corporate and financial worlds in Fidelity, Goldman Sachs and Compaq / HP.

The wider team (some not shown) include the co-founders of Playdemic, and TT games, the ex-CEO of Sega Europe, and the lifetime president of Eidos, who is our Chairman Ian Livingstone CBE.
Some interesting facts about the team: 
They have worked on AI for spacecraft systems 
They have worked on hits such as the Repton series, Ravenskull and Pipeline Plus 
They have remixed C64 tracks for Chris Abbott's ""Back in Time"" albums 
They have written emulators for the Spectrum and BBC Micro 
Written game scripts, and articles for publications like Retro Gamer, Retro Survival, and Edge 
Produced arcade conversions for Midnight Resistance, Cabal, and Road Runner 
Been programming games for more than 30 years 
Won ENnie awards as a fantasy illustrator 
Earned a Guinness world record for Dragon's Lair being the largest video game ported to the ZX81 
One of them even wrote and sang the theme tune for a glove puppet called Helix D Monster!  
As you can see, it's a multi-talented and broadly skilled team, and there is a clear flare for gaming and specifically retro games.  Not only can these folks produce magic, they are passionate about doing it! 
What does each reward mean?

They will be able to name the challenge in question, but we reserve the right to refuse names that we would find inappropriate and/or offensive. In those cases, we will work together with the backer to find a suitable name. Note that not all games can support challenges, don’t hesitate to get in touch during the campaign if you wish to know more. 
 Beat My Score. Backers with this rewards will be given the opportunity to choose a game, play it with us, and set the default high score for that game, with their name or handle, as supported by the game as the default high score for everyone on the  platform. We reserve the right to refuse names that we would find inappropriate and/or offensive. In case multiple people selecting the same game, we would allow them all to set their names in the high score table, as long as the game permits enough names to be listed.
We are putting the final touches to the service at the moment, and we believe that it will be available to all this summer.
 As we are getting closer to our launch date, we felt that a crowdfunding campaign was a good way for us to do a number of things: 
We will learn from our prospective audience ahead of launch. This will allow us to serve them better, for example by installing servers in the regions where demand will be highest. 
We will start engaging with the fans about the games that will be available. We want the service to be built as a community space, and a crowdfunding campaign seems like a great way to start the conversation. 
We have many fans who have been supportive of our project over the years, this is also a way for us to offer them an opportunity to get their Antstream subscription at a much lower price point from the offering we will have at launch of $10 per month. 
 We hope this will help to spread the word about Antstream far and wide.  
The funds collected will all go towards development of the platform, as well as adding more games and features. If the Kickstarter campaign does not reach its goal, it will not change our release schedule in any significant way. However, it might mean we will prioritise development differently."
92,1527251202,"In ""Rebound,"" a movie star (Tristan Lloyd Goddard) and a struggling actor (Virgil Eisen Fluesen) compete for the same role in a Broadway play - Who gets the part? Well, that's up to a very divided and volatile casting team. The play has been aptly described as ""an exploration of the nature of bonding and friendship amidst the chaos of the casting process.""
On October 27th, 2016 and May 5th, 2018, ""Rebound"" had public staged readings at K/Q Playwrights and HB Studio, respectively. The extremely positive audience reactions and feedback we received at both readings convinced us that the play deserves an Off-Broadway production, which brings us to the fundraising we are attempting on Kickstarter. 
Rather than send the play to literary agents and theater producers, and wait for a response, we've decided to go grass roots with our Kickstarter Campaign, and raise the funds necessary to produce the play ourselves.  In addition to being actors and playwrights, both of us have vast theatrical production experience. Dan Haft was a co-founder and Producing Director of The Sackett Group, a Brooklyn-based nonprofit theater company, between 1990 and 2007. David Logan Rankin was Co-Artistic Director (with Scott Cargle) of The Theater Exchange in Houston, Texas from 1982-86, as well as a key acting member and stage manager for the late James Gale's Urban Theater Company from 1989- 1994. Upon his return to New York City, Mr. Rankin was a key actor and designer for The Shakespeare Project from 1996 - 2005, and worked as Managing Director for TSP from 2003 - 2005. As a playwright, David was  co-translator of a new translation of Sartre's No Exit, as well as an Artist-in-Residence for Mabou Mines with his play Mister Nameless Returns in their 2001-2002 Artist Suite. His other plays include A Break From the Routine, Two Cats Talking and A Lamentation On the Demise of the Romanticism of Smoking, all of which have been given professional readings in New York City.
Our intention is to keep intact the wonderful cast who performed the reading of Rebound at HB Studio, including (in order of appearance):

There once was an ordinary guy and his health was poor. So poor that the state granted him a disablement allowance. Only this allowance was much too small to live on. Therefore, he had to find a job.
This guy also had a dream. Not just any dream, but a Dream – with a capital D. He dreamt of making a great visual novel. As it’s not something he could do on his own, he decided to put together a team of developers. He found other disabled people and started paying them with his allowance money. He helped them a lot by doing this because they didn’t have jobs or allowances.

The team was very happy and everyone did their best, which lead to an excellent demo version of the future game that you can download right now by clicking the link. Then the guy decided that everyone deserved a bonus for such an excellent job. Then he thought – “Why not raise some money on a crowd funding platform?” And that’s how this page was made.
 And now a few words about the creators of the game.
Plot and idea author – Vladimir Petrov (diabetes, hypertension). The guy who started it all. He is an infinitely cheerful comedian, who’s love of life is contagious and who’s sharing his big Dream with us.
Artist – Vladimir Litau (arm fracture). Despite him breaking an arm in an accident, he kept drawing sprites without even waiting for the cast to come off.
Background designer – Maksim Sakun (constant colds). Volunteered to help and now draws beautiful 3-D backgrounds for us. There wasn’t anything left of the allowance to pay him, so he is working for absolutely free!
Composer – Aleksei Demidov (spinal fracture). A very talented musician, whose compositions wonderfully complement our visual novels. He is a fine nature and a good person.
Scriptwriter, programmer, designer – Ruslan Nebykov (multiple concussions, allergies, hypertension). He is helping to create the novel. Responsible for writing the script, the code and the mini games. His dream is to write books. The hole in his head doesn’t stop him from writing daring and clever stories.
Translator – Yuliya Cherkasova. Our princess. We decided not to draw her cartoon version; in our team, she’s the only one who’s normal and healthy, besides that, she is simply a wonderful person.
We’re not asking money for treatment and we don’t need charity! We are selling copies of our future game. We only need a bit of financial help from our future readers to finish the novel.
We are laughing about our ""cripple team"" ourselves - just look at our comical portraits. You too should see this all as a joke.
What’s more, this story is for those whose life isn’t too sweet either. If you have a dream then nothing can get in your way! There might even be people who would want to help a “cripple team” to release an awesome game. We’re not promising you logo tees or posters with our characters. We simply don’t have time for that because we’re working on the game day and night. Instead, we will pay you back in keys to the game we will release on Steam. The most generous of you will get special thanks in the credits. It may not be much but it’s from all our hearts! Remember, the world is what you make of it. Follow your Dreams and you’ll do great!
It's quite difficult to make a game on 1000$. But we intentionally lowered our goal amount to raise at least some money. We will finish the novel in any case, even if we don't raise any money!
If we raise enough money for a bonus that’ll be great. Nevertheless, if it turns out that we raised more than the goal amount, we will start working on the second part of the game right after the first part is released. It will be even more entertaining and exciting!
The full version of the game will be released in autumn of this year - winter at the latest. Watch out for new game releases on Steam.
P.S.:
We estimate the development of the game takes one year. If the fee each team member will be $ 300 per month, then we need $ 18,000. If we do not reach this amount, we will not get anything. But we would be very useful to any money. So we decided not to ask too much.

Goblins. We usually see these mischievous, green creatures as obstacles for your adventuring party. Killing goblins means easy experience for a lowly adventurer. Kissing goblins on the other hand…
You’re in for a far greater adventure!
 “A goblin dating simulator & TTRPG inspired visual novel. Explore the world, meet new characters, and make choices that decide your story!”
Hidden Treasures is a dating simulator AND visual novel that draws inspiration from Tabletop Role-Playing Games. You play as the main character in your own adventure, meeting characters and making choices that guide your story. Also to be clear this IS a dating sim but the romantic and flirt options are outlined so if you wanted to just spend time in a friendly fashion through a character's route you can!
Do you find choose-your-own-adventure books exciting? Are you a fan of dating games looking for something new? Do you just want to date goblins?
If you said no, don’t worry. You may just find this game is a hidden treasure…
You can find our Twitter here AND you can play our demo here!
 In Hidden Treasures, there will be times when you will roll a number based on your character’s attributes to determine an outcome: That’s where the TTRPG elements come in.
If a choice you want to make requires a lot of strength when you make that choice your strength stat and a random number from 1-20 will decide if you succeed or fail. You can make choices that play to your strengths, or take a risk. If between dates you'll have downtime where you can go to different areas in the village or surrounding area and come across plenty of random encounters. Some of them will even start up side quests that will give you an extra side story to follow! 
Even if you fail, that doesn’t mean game over! Failure doesn’t mean a negative outcome. Instead of closing a door, it can open up a new path for you to take and explore!
 Every day you spend in this new world will present you with options. Where will you go? Who will you spend time with? Take goblins on dates, aid them in their quests, or forge your own path. The choice is up to you!
 Hidden Treasures has eight main characters, with their own unique stories. Who will you help? Who will you befriend? Who will YOU fall in love with?
Callo
Krieve
Lynn
Oskar
Siobhan
Stab
Stendra

Your character is your own creation! This game lets you:
 Choose a name for them.
   Choose from three different classes: Fighter (sword and shield), Ranger (bow and arrow), and Wizard (spells and more spells!)
   Pick their personality as you play, with a variety of dialogue options for every situation. No more choosing between just “nice” or “mean!”
   Decide who they romance! Your character will in love with our charming cast of characters… and maybe you will too!
   Enjoy your digital copy of Hidden Treasures! The game will be available for both Mac and PC! 
 Want to take a look at all the concept art designs we've worked on over the development of this project? The artbook will be full of early to late designs, different outfits, sketches, and more by each of the contributing artists! It will be sent out as a digital PDF and if possible we'll contact backers for early versions of a physical version when available. 
STICKERS! A full sticker set, 3x3 in of the main cast of eight for you to put anywhere and take with you! On a bag? Absolutely! On a computer? Of course! On a greatsword? Maybe not functional but it'll look great!
 There's a lot of narrative choices and options that go into this game and we want your help in discovering what does and doesn't work. Even if you go through and the only thing you have to say is that you liked it, that helps! This tier is beta access to early scenes over development to get your feedback and help us shape it to be the best game possible for you!
 Do you have an original character you'd like to show up? At the beginning of the game, which you can see in the demo above, there are 3 characters that appear to chat with you. In the full version of the introduction, there will be random characters that pop up to mention a line or two of dialogue which could be a character of your design! The final character sprite will also be sent to you as a high-quality image to save.
 Not only do you get to create a an NPC to appear in the game but you'll also be able to choose which of the main 8 you'd like them to interact with. Create a situation where another ranger challenges Callo to an archery contest. Do you have an idea of someone who thinks they could out drink Lynn? Is there are a strange creature that Siobhan would encounter in the woods that they can't help but want to catch? Let's find out together!
Let's have a one on one and figure out exactly how this came to be! Gabe will take you out through the power of technology! (Video Call) to a Coffee shop, park, or other general date location of your choice and you'll sit down to hear some of the more personal details of the game. What did it take, what were some of the hardest parts, what parts specifically were inspired by personal events (more than you might think) and how do they fit in?
 ADD-ONS
(If you'd like more than one key, you may add $10 to your KS pledge for a max of 2 keys/$20 for an extra 2 keys sent to you upon release. You may do this at any tier! To do this you go to your pledge and click the manage your pledge option, and change amount. Then you just add in the value!)
 The digital pin-up calendar will not have full nudity and will in fact be PG-13+. It will be from January - December 2020!
 The second act will focus more on the relationship that you've built up and how it helps resolve conflict depending on your choices made in the first act. Reaching the second act will also be dependant on a key choice you'll have to make at the end of the first act.  
 New areas mean sometimes you'll need different equipment and will need to be differently outfitted! We wanted to actively portray that and give you more places to discover, more lore to experience, and more fashion to appreciate. 
 This game has a fairly big cast and whether we want to give them all voice versus whether we can are two different things but at this goal, we'll be able to give each character a voice like we've been hoping to do!


Backer Goals
 First backer goal of 200 unlocked!
So we actually just hit our first backer goal! We wanted to give you more depth on the goblins so because of that, each of the main 8 will be getting a 4-page comic giving you a little bit of background of their younger days for a 32-page digital comic! For all backers!
 Second backer goal of 500 unlocked!
This one for our 5E players!  Explore the HT world at your tables! New subclasses, NPCs, items, and even a little DM chart for adding in some romance aspects for relationships with NPCs and their reactions

Reaching a total number of backers to each of these goals will unlock something special that will be released for free and available for everyone who backed the Kickstarter regardless of the tier. Some of them will be especially exciting for those of you who played a specific tabletop that involves dungeons.  When they're reached we'll announce here what exactly you unlocked!
Have you ever wanted advice from a motherly assassin goblin? Here's your chance! For every 50 retweets on our pinned tweet for the Kickstarter, you'll be getting a little clip animation of motherly advice from romance options Stab's mother! (voiced by Gabe's actual mother!) Some sympathetic, some stabby!
This game is possible because of the hard-working group of people that make up this team. Everyone had a main role but there was no lacking in the team reaching out to help each other to make sure that we stayed on track and could create something astonishing.

'Tis the season! Upon doing a search for pins for Pride, I found that many options are limited to rainbows and unicorns - I wanted to create a pin that was straight to the point, out, proud, and inclusive! These enamel pins represent LGBTQIA+ self-love and allyship and are a proclamation of Pride all year long. A portion of all sales after production will benefit a rotating selection of LGBTQIA+ charities (local and national). Unfortunately for me, this fancy rainbow coating runs a higher minimum than my normal pins - so I'm reaching out to you for pre-ordering goodness!
Pins are soft enamel with rainbow anodized metal and 1.25” (about 35mm) in size, with pink rubber backings. All pins come packaged on a customized backing card.
Your pledge will go toward:
Production of pins and backing cards (90%) 
Shipping and shipping materials (5%) 
GOALS
$500 | Metallic PridePins are Produced! 
$600 | Pride design stickers ship with each order! 
$700 | Surprise MINI PIN unlocked and ships with each order!

Hi! I'm Jonathan Kamens. I maintain ten different add-ons for the Mozilla Thunderbird email app, and I need your help to be able to keep doing that. If you use any of my add-ons and you want to keep using them past 2020, please read on!
Thunderbird is a great application, but sometimes people want it to do things differently, either because they have a different vision for how the app should behave, or because it's impossible for the folks who maintain Thunderbird to include every feature that anyone wants. That's where add-ons come in.
The first add-on I started maintaining, nearly a decade ago, was Send Later. Send Later allows users to write emails now and schedule them to be delivered later, either just once or on a schedule. I wanted to be able to do that, but the original author of Send Later was no longer maintaining it and it was no longer working, so I took on the challenge of fixing it.
Since Send Later, I've either written from scratch or taken over maintenance of eleven other add-ons, nine of which (Folder Pane View Switcher, Show All Body Parts, IMAP Received Date, Enhanced Priority Display, Reply to Multiple Messages, Toggle Replied, userChromeJS, Undigestify, and Remote Content By Folder), are still active.
All my add-ons have always been entirely free. Although I've accepted donations to support development of some of my add-ons, those donations have always been entirely voluntary, and most users do not donate.
Up until about a year ago, the code within Thunderbird that supports add-ons was pretty stable, so the effort required to keep existing add-ons working was minimal. However, about a year ago, the maintainers of Thunderbird start down a path of changes which force add-on maintainers to rewrite all of their add-ons before the release of Thunderbird 78, which is currently scheduled for June 2020.
Those changes began before the release of Thunderbird 68 in August 2019. Although it was difficult, I was able to fix most of my add-ons for compatibility with Thunderbird 68, and therefore most of my users have been able to continue using them as they've switched to the new Thunderbird version. However, the changes coming in Thunderbird 78 are much more extensive, and I will need to do a lot more work on my add-ons for Thunderbird 78 than I did for 68. It's simply too much work for me to sustain continuing to do it for just voluntary donations.
Therefore, I have made the difficult decision to switch to a subscription model for my add-ons. Once Thunderbird 78 is released, my add-ons will require licenses to use, priced as follows:
$5 per year per user for a single add-on
$10 per year per user for three add-ons
$25 per year per user for all add-ons
$50 for a perpetual license for one user for all add-ons
I've launched this Kickstarter campaign because I can't proceed unless about 10% of my add-ons' current users commit in advance to keep using and paying for them.
Otherwise, I'm afraid when Thunderbird 78 is released my add-ons will stop working, except for the ones that someone else steps forward and volunteers to take over and update.
And you know what? It would be awesome if someone else took over my add-ons and continued to maintain them for free, just as I took over Send Later years ago. I love and believe in free software, so that would actually be the ideal outcome as far as I'm concerned. I've tried to find people to do that, but so far I've been unsuccessful. As far as I'm concerned, switching to a licensing model like this is actually the lesser of two evils; it's either this or abandon my add-ons completely and leave all of my users in the lurch, which I'd really rather not do if I can avoid it.
This Kickstarter campaign may actually help me find people willing to take over my add-ons and maintain them for free. If this campaign succeeds, and some of my add-ons do get adopted by new maintainers, then I'll pay them from the proceeds of the campaign. Having that on offer may help me attract new maintainers for my add-ons, so you may get to keep using the add-ons for free even after the licenses I'm offering in this campaign would have expired."

101,929281757,"Overview
The Tempus Fugit is a simple WordClock interface board for your Raspberry Pi Zero or Arduino Nano. The time in words is spelt out on an 8 by 8 letter matrix, with accuracy maintained using an on-board battery backed real time clock chip.
Although the base WordClock will be the English language version pictured I will also include templates and s/w [via GitHub] for a Dutch and Latin version - See the Kickstarter updates more information. 
Interested, but having trouble getting a Pi Zero - then start with a Arduino Nano. It is easy to change this out later on, just unplug the Nano and plug in your Pi Zero. You can also use the Tempus Fugit with any of the other Raspberry Pi computers - there is more detail on this in the following section.
Design Evolution 
The clock started out as a Christmas project for a Pi Zero I had just received. Having got a lot attention from my original blog post, I decided to work it up to launch as a Kickstarter, essentially to fund a production run of PCB boards. While working the PCB layout for the TF I realised it would be quite easy to incorporate the option to run the clock from an Arduino Nano. So spent a bit of time breadboarding it to check there were no problems with the Arduino RTC and display driver libraries, then added a Arduino Nano as an alternative processor option onto the PCB layout.
Finally in the spirit of flexibility I added extra drilling's so you can, with relative ease also mount a Raspberry Pi A / B onto the back of the TF board and then wire them it in using individual jumpers. The only Pi's I haven't  catered for are the very early revisions without any fixing points. These will still drive the board but you will have to figure out your own mounting arrangements.
The guess is that most people wanting to support the Kickstarter will opt for the kit reward level, but I have included 2 additional 'ready built' levels - one which is PiZero ready and one which will include a pre-programmed Arduino Nano clone. The numbers are limited so please don't wait too long to pledge if interested. 
Functionality 
The Tempus Fugit word clock displays the time using the '12 hour' format in words spelt out on an 8 by 8 letter matrix, time is displayed in 5 minute slots [5,10,15,20 ...]. The correct time is maintained when the unit is not powered by an on-board battery backed RTC chip. 
With an 8 x 8 matrix there obviously have to be some compromises, for instance 'HALF' and  'TWO';  
Even with the limits of an 8x8 matrix you can display time to a + / - 3 minute accuracy.
Three rear mounted pushes allow the time to set and adjusted as needed. Instructions will also be included on how to optionally set the TF time via a connected PC. 
In normal operation the TF does not need to be connected to the internet or a host computer.
Pledge reward levels include kit an built versions of the clock, For an example of the detail that will be included in the instructions for the kit version follow this link to the Pi-LCD build instructions, my last Kickstarter.
Technical Description
The finished printed circuit board size will be about 112mm x 70mm, it could have been little shorter but with these dimensions the length to width ratio works out to 1.6 which is often referred to a 'Golden Triangle' -  considered by many artists and architects to be the most aesthetically pleasing form of a rectangle, so I decided to stick with it. 
With the exception of the display and Pi Zero / Arduino most other components are mounted on the rear of the board, - Pi / Arduino could have gone on the back but why hide a thing of beauty ! 
Hardware
Display - 60x60mm red 
No surface mount parts on the TF board, so should not be challenging to solder with a basic level of competence 
Raspberry Pi interface, compatible with old and new Pi's as it only uses the first 26 GPIO header lines
Power for the board is via Pi's micro USB connector or for the Arduino it's Mini-B USB connector [note connecting leads and PSU are not supplied with any of the pledge options]
The real time clock (RTC) is battery backed with CR1220 coil cell, [because of postage restrictions the battery is not included in any of the pledge rewards]
There are 3 monetary switches, these are used to allow the clock to be set and to shut the Pi down cleanly when not connected to a host computer 
The Letter Matrix
To keep costs down I am NOT planning to commission a custom acrylic overlay, to date I have found laser printed squares to work fine, this also gives you the opportunity to experiment with different fonts. I will include a few pre-printed overlays in the kits as well as providing templates on-line.
Addtionally overlays for the Dutch and Latin versions will be included with the pledge rewards
Software
Python code will be available for down load via GitHub for Raspberry Pi setup and as a sketch for the Arduino
Differences between prototype and final production version
Slightly smaller [112/70mm]
The 3 pushes will be rear mounted and changed to low profile parts
Most components with the exception of the Pi / Arduino will be rear mounted
Sockets will be included in the kits to give the option not to solder the Arduino / Pi Zero directly in - with the PiZero I think it is actually easier to solder it directly as you only need to solder GPIO lines used not all 40 !
The RTC will be incorporated directly onto the PCB rather than as separate daughter board 
The power on indicator LED will not be included as both the Pi and Nano have on-board power indicators 
Current Design Development Status
The design is at the working prototype PCB stage, as you can see from the main project picture, the work todate and remaining design activities are detailed in the following bullet points
What’s been accomplished so far
The hardware design is complete
I have identified multiple sources for all the parts
Pi and Nano hardware has been prototyped on breadboards and tested
The PCB layout is complete and tested
The software for the Raspberry Pi version has been running on the prototype for over a month now, but I will tidy it up a little mainly to improve the commenting. The Arduino software still needs some work but I have tested all the functional blocks together. Currently I am using less than 30% of the Ardunio's memory this will grow slightly but I do not envisage any capacity issues
Proto-type Dutch and Latin version are up and running
What work remains to be done
I have now received and tested the prototype PCBs against a Rapsberry Pi boards and Nano Clones. This has allowed me to check the layout and importantly confirm the mechanical interfaces are correct. I am will be going through a second prototype cycle which is allowed for in the overall reward delivery plan.
From the software perspective there is no no significant development work to do so I plan to wait until the prototype boards are available and then complete the software.
Educational uses
One of the aims of the Kickstarter is to be able to offer the Tempus Fugit WordClock as a sensibly priced kit for schools and electronics clubs. This could range from a basic kit build to learn/improve soldering skills, to providing pupils with a ready build card without a processor and then asking them to research and select a suitable processor card. This would be a good example of applying an abstraction process to a real world problem [part of the UK key stage 3 curriculum].
One point I took away from a recent chat with a teacher is offering part built boards, to make the kits more accessible to children / adults with more limited soldering skills. This is something I certainly plan to do with the TF and my previous Kickstarter's.
Notes:-
Pi Zero's and SD cards are not included in any of the pledge reward levels - not required if you are going down the Arduino route
A PSU adapter is not included in any of the pledge rewards, I generally run the prototype with the official Pi PSU, but any PSU rated to work with a Raspberry Pi should be fine. For the Arduino option you will need an Adapter with a Mini-B USB connector or you can connect directly to the board check the Arduino website for details
No case or mounting is included in the pledge rewards but I do hope to make a 3D printing file and some other options available at a later date
Tools and solder needed to construct the kits are not included
Pledge rewards will be sent out by Royal Mail using an untracked service - to keep postage costs down. The exception to this will be the built and tested boards will be sent tracked and / or signed depending on services available to your location. "

In antagonistic roles of a lifetime Diana Bentley and Damon Runyan star as Isobel and Tony; co-starring is Ryan Rogerson as Thomas a sharp tongued if unwilling adversary forced into battle. Tony and Isobel deploy every trick in the bully’s rule-book, and with a killer mentality move quickly to emasculate, humiliate, and undermine Thomas. Without losing a beat Mark Caven rounds out this incredible cast in the role of Carter.

Financial Post:
How a theatre can sustain longterm prosperity is complex. It will require establishing a solid reputation with the work we produce in these early months and years. As we grow we will continue to develop a strategy to support ourselves through each season. We will look to responsible corporate resources and government funding. It probably goes without saying these resources are extremely hard to come by for a new company.
This campaign marks a crucial step toward our future.

To continue bringing together great audiences and productions at the Coal Mine Theatre we need to ask for your support. In return we offer some great perks and this promise: We will always strive to rise you from your seats, thrill you with laughter, to challenge you with sights and sounds and reach you with inspired feeling.
This $5,000 goal comes from our projected ticket sales crossed with a very modest, rock-and-roll indie theatre budget where talent is never sacrificed and quality is always worth more than a penny in the back pocket. Money raised goes toward the following:
Rights - for use of the play.
Lights and sound - so you may hear and see us.
Props and costume - so you will believe us.
Professional fees - so we will live.
Publicity - so we will reach more of you.

“Exquisitely excruciating and relentlessly brutal, a vicious comedy.” – Time Out
""Bartlett applies his down-and-dirty, black-humored and trenchant approach to the concept of business employment as survival of the fittest…the play is like a protracted death scene among a group of wild animals, with the strong ones—a pair of smartly-dressed, smirking thugs—mercilessly circling and taunting the weak until it's time to deliver the inevitable fatal blows."" —Associated Press.
“I think it’s one that a lot of people have to confront every day when they get up and go to work. London is full of people who have to put on a suit, get on the tube, go to an office and win.” -- Exeuntmagazine.com
""Toronto’s indie theatre companies have given us a number of memorable, low-budget production of plays that might once have been reflexively slotted into a Canadian Stage season before it went off in its current, idiosyncratic, interdisciplinary direction. (David Ferry has been responsible for several of these passion projects.) Personally, I’m much happier with the ecology now – even if it requires theatregoers to do a little more work to find the good stuff."" -- David Ferry on theatre in The Globe and Mail

“Could these photos end up in the history books?” BBC
“Stunning pictures of Bristol’s citizens” Bristol Post
“…the results - which he has called Covid Chronicles - are quite frankly stunning” Derby Telegraph 
With over 100 participants, this book documents people in Bristol during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown of Spring 2020. All the images are in black and white as a hat tip to the great documentary photographers of the 20th century whose work I admire and grew up looking at.
Whilst confined to our homes, we all navigated the lockdown in different ways. I used my government sanctioned daily exercise allowance to cycle around photographing the residents from an appropriate social distance. The images portray a wide range of people from all over Bristol and are accompanied by their thoughts from the day. Those thoughts range from pithy short sentences to longer more philosophical musings and show, among other things, humour, poignancy, pragmatism and fun.
From a personal perspective a 100% drop in income was a shock, yet I found the project to be life affirming and uplifting. As I said in a live radio interview about the Covid Chronicles on the BBC - the people I met were trying to see the positives in this time and were displaying a resilience that was both heartening and encouraging.
I probably met more people in 6 weeks than I had done in the previous 6 years. I hope this book documents our brief time together as we lived through an unprecedented time in our history.
And I can’t do it without you!
Photographer David Keenan summed it up brilliantly on his Kickstarter page. ""With the disappearance of so many independent local booksellers and the downward pressure exerted by large chains and Amazon, publishers can no longer afford to take chances on a new artist, in response, a new model has been born: the artist-funded book. That’s where Kickstarter and you come in.”
The world of photography book publishing has changed enormously since I was a young man entering this business. David Keenan is right, photo books are now often self/crowd funded without the involvement from a traditional publisher. I want to produce the best quality book I can as a reminder of this time, as a memory for all of us but especially those who took part and as a social document for others to see in years to come. This Kickstarter will allow me the funds to produce a hardback book containing the images and quotes from those who took part.
Stretch goals.
If I exceed my funding target beyond the original cost of design, production and shipping of the initial print run I hope there will be enough to: 1 Allow more copies to be printed so that it can also go on sale in local bookshops. 2. Fund printing for an exhibition of the images once we get back to a semblance of normality.

Transparency statement about the goal amount.
I've never really considered why photography books cost £25 and upwards. Now I understand why. Short print runs, set up and shipping costs help explain it. Also, Kickstarter takes 5% plus another 3-5% for card processing fees.
Reseaching the goal amount also highlighted design cost, a mock up 'dummy book' for ensuring design dimensions are correct, wet proof(s), ISBN number (so book can be sold in shops), print cost, delivery to me, heavy duty packaging and shipping costs. To be completely upfront there's a small buffer added just incase of miscalculations but it still doesn't leave much change from the £7100 goal.
Obviously, I really want the book to become a reality - I'd love seeing my work in print but it's also an opportunity for those who were photographed in this new socially distant way to have a permanent record - it'll be around forever and it'll be a document of our Spring 2020. Also, it could be a great present for family and friends. ;-) 
I'd love your support and look forward to seeing the series transformed into an actual book, thank you."
104,2021330096,"My goal is to travel to major cities across America and photograph mothers nursing their children. I hope to have as much diversity as I can throughout the book, as well as quotes and stories from mothers throughout the nation, of their experiences/struggles/triumphs.
The purpose of this book is to show that breastfeeding in any form, is beautiful, natural, and amazing. I hope to help empower women, be an influence to women who haven't decided how they plan to nourish their baby yet, I hope to be a shining light to those that are disapproving, to show that breastfeeding is God's intended way for us to nourish our children.
This project will also show that nursing in public is NOT shameful. Nor indecent. I plan to photograph mothers in very public places, such as national monuments, popular areas, Capitals, etc.
When my husband first took photos of me nursing our daughter, I instantly fell in love. As a mother and a photographer, I thought, ""What better way to preserve this special and intimate moment in a mother's life, than to photograph it?"". Breastfeeding being something very special to me, I wanted to do a shoot with several mothers and babies, to show the beauty of breastfeeding. To show that it's OKAY to nurse in public. It's OKAY to nurse your toddler. It's OKAY to tandem nurse. I received interest from several mothers throughout North Georgia, and scheduled the shoot in my hometown, at the beautiful Berry College. The photos were a HUGE success. I believe these photos show that breastfeeding is beautiful, not something to be hidden and disapproved of. 
I received so much praise and thanks for these photos, that I couldn't wait to do more. With World Breastfeeding Week coming up in August, there are dozens of mothers wanting to capture these special intimate moments with baby. So I thought, why reduce this to just my hometown? What if I travelled the U.S. and photographed as many nursing mothers as I could. Even further, why don't I publish a book, showcasing to the world what a beautiful thing this is. 
With each photo, with each book sold, that's another step closer to breastfeeding acceptance. To comfortability. 
It's another mother realizing that even though her family/friends don't understand it or support it, it only matters how SHE wants to nourish her baby.
It's a mother knowing that she's not alone, there are tons of other mothers that also nurse their toddlers.
It's an in-law realizing that just because she didn't do it, that it is a great bond between mother and child, and she should be supportive. 
Whatever your experience with breastfeeding, good or bad, I hope will be showcased in this book. There will be quotes/stories throughout the book from people like you. People that have experienced the same hardships, the same triumphs. Because you're not alone. 
With proceeds I raise beyond the $10k goal, I'll be able to travel to more locations, to photograph mothers that aren't able to travel to the locations set."
105,2051110684,"The green led backlighting seems to accentuate the VFD tubes.
VFD7 with blue led backlighting.
The VFD clock III is the end view version of the IV-11 (side view) VFD tube clock, seen in the project ""The VFD clock"". It uses IV-22 VFD (vacuum fluorescent display) tubes. It can be built from the kit, or pledged for the assembled version, with a homemade enclosure. One difference in the end view IV-22 VFD tubes is that they are plugged into pin sockets, not soldered to the board as the IV-11 types were, so replacement would be much easier. GPS or wifi module option is also available for auto time date set.
With mixed led backlighting.
RGB led back-lighting makes a variety of different color combinations possible, from all blue to green to multi-colored etc. This is demonstrated in the video. Using the led color button, this can be selected anytime. We have created a prototype with both boards professionally made and are also developing a kit for DIY. We designed the VFD clock III to be aesthetically pleasing and sturdily built as well as long lasting. One of the features that sets it apart is the unique homemade enclosure, which I hand make from thermo-formed 1/8"" plexiglass.
The one piece thermoformed plexiglass case.
It is built using entirely replaceable/repairable parts. The components are all standard sized and selected to be large enough to easily handle the wattage generated. Also, the two layer design gives the clock a more solid form than other designs. The power supply is integrated in the bottom layer pc board, so there is no external AC adapter, just a standard electric cord & plug, no ""wall wart"". The input can be set for 120VAC (U.S. standard) or for 240VAC (some countries) by simply setting a small jumper on the bottom board (please see picture).
The two boards give the design a solid look. Shown is the prototype with the square (standard) transformer. The productions run will use a toroidal (round) transformer for reduced EMI & more efficient power.
Battery backup is optional using a nine volt battery. The top layer board contains the micro controller running my original firmware and decoder as well as digit driver circuitry and the IV-11 tubes. GPS module or Wifi module can also be added for auto time date set. Altogether, this makes the VFD clock very unique and attractive, as well as durable and easy to maintain. 
Night phase in blue.
The kit for this clock is available in varying degrees, so the user can choose to start with as little or as many components as they want, and customize it to their own specs.

106,1200921115,"ONLINE FARMER’S MARKETPLACE WITH AN INTUITIVE DELIVERY AND ORDER TRACKING SOFTWARE
We‘re creating an online marketplace that allows customers and restaurants the choice to support their local farms and vendors over big box grocery stores and businesses. By keeping our price low and offering no delivery fee, our customers are more inclined to order locally. We want the local community to always shop local and support their local economy.
Customer Experience
Our Vision is to allow our community the ability to order farm fresh products, a la carte, with free delivery
HOW IT WORKS
  WHAT OUR VENDORS DO:  
They set the minimum checkout amount
They set the delivery distance / radius
They pick one day of the week to fulfill all of their orders
For example, Dwight Shrute’s Beet Farm has a minimum checkout amount at $30. Every Wednesday Dwight will deliver, in a 5 mile radius, throughout Scranton Pennsylvania and fulfill all of his Beet Farm orders. This works great for Dwight because he picked a delivery day that worked best for him, and he is only leaving his farm on Wednesdays to deliver paid-for orders in a radius that he has chosen.
WHAT OUR SYSTEM DOES:
We see your selected delivery zone / areas
We market directly to those areas, customers, and restaurants to increase your sales
We provide a delivery map and detailed weekly order report to make deliveries a breeze
We provide a detailed weekly financial sales report
We have a built-in inventory tracker for all of your product levels
We take care of all transaction fees

WHAT IT COSTS OUR VENDORS:
It costs absolutely nothing to become a vendor. No monthly fee, No annual fee, No sign up fee.
We cover all transaction and credit card related fees. We want to keep our price low so that our vendors can keep their price low. Our goal is to get their products in the hands of their local community as easily and affordably as possible. We want our customers to be able to order through our site and see a price that is what they would expect to find and pay for, had they purchased at the farmers market or their grocery store.
We will collect 8% of all sales made through the website, this will include all processing fees
The 2-sided benefit to our Crowdfunding Rewards
By offering Farm Boxes as a reward, we are instantly connecting our supprters with farms in their local area. Not only will they be rewarded with their fresh boxes, but it also helps us pull in the farms in their area to our site. Farmers will then have a monetary incentive to come online and fulfill prepaid orders!
PLAY

How are we different than a CSA?
Most CSAs deliver a box of random produce to an agreed upon location with a varying frequency that you’ve chosen. Although our rewards are customizable farm boxes, that is not how the typical checkout would be. This is just the reward we are offering to our kickstarter supporters. 
Once launched, our site will allow you to shop just like you were at a farmers market, choosing individual items from each farm. With the bonus of having it delivered directly to your door!"

108,1358997817,"Inspiration
It started with the inconvenience of finding paper clips or alligator clips at the bottom of any pen holder or scattered in drawers. This problem inspired a design that we thought others would enjoy using in their everyday lives. We tried to make a very simple, geometric, pen holder that retains structural integrity while remaining light and minimal.
Production and Design
The initial concept was a very minimalist design and was made to create a space for loose stationery such as paperclips.

Original Concept
 We then went over different functional aspects of the design to include things like multiple slots and changes in size/shape. The results are the progress you see in the pictures below.
PenPost progress (left to right)
 After all the iterations we settled on the final design you see below. It maintains the minimalist design we were aiming for while offering the most functionality.
Final Design
With the funding raised, we'll be able to get started on printing and shipping the base pledge almost immediately. The funding would allow us to print with the more exotic materials and provide custom engravings to accommodate the higher tier pledges.
Colors/Materials/Finish/Customization
The base tier pledge provides you with 5 color options, those being blue, red, light blue, green and orange. These are made from PLA, a material derived from a renewable resource (corn starch) and is also compostable at the end of of its life.
PenPost base reward color options
With the second tier pledge, you can choose which material you would like your PenPost in, which include PLA based carbon fiber, granite, nylon, aluminum or wood (from left to right below).
Render to show color of material options
Finally, if you’re really excited about this project, you have the option of engraving a name/message above the tray of your PenPost with any of the material/color options above.
These fonts were hand picked to match the aesthetic and feel of the PenPost. Engravings will be in either black or white to maximize contrast based on the color/material of the PenPost chosen. One of the following six fonts can be used for your engraving:

109,1886852477,"Hi, my name is John Hursh. I work with a program called Toolbox4Life in Orlando, Florida. We remodel homes in the area for the elderly, veterans, and/or handicapped individuals. Currently, our all-female crew of construction students are working on the home of Mrs. Jones. We do this regularly as a part of our program, but this home has many issues, needs and challenges. There are many needs, in fact, that we’ve exhausted our budget. We cannot give her the thing she really needs, a new kitchen. Her kitchen is in dire need of attention; it’s worn and unsafe. 
Mrs. Jones has served her community for over 45 years and has been widowed for nearly 30. She still works every week at her church handing out meals, clothing and much needed encouragement to others, while her own needs are going unmet.
This is were you come in. Since we have a limited amount of funds for each home we repair free of charge, we can sometimes only do so much. However, Mrs. Jones home needs more resources to make it safe and dignifying. 
For $5000, we can demolish her kitchen, fix plumbing, install new dry wall, paint, replace the worn-out linoleum, install new cabinets, counter tops and new, donated appliances (dishwasher, refrigerator, range, vent hood and disposal).
We are donating our time and sweat; please provide the funds to help us finish this home in  a way that is fit for any aunt, grandma or mom. Consider donating today so that we can have Mrs. Jones back in her kitchen in time for Thanksgiving and the Christmas holidays! 
Thank you for your consideration. We promise to post pictures of the process, as well as the finished product.

110,1712227037,"Support Maya Moon Co.'s mission to harmonize ecosystems worldwide through decadent and nourishing chocolate truffles.
Maya Moon is launching a new line of Chakra Chocolate Truffles, with seven delicious, energy-activating flavors. Over the past two years, we have perfected the recipe for these honey-sweetened, all-natural, decadent truffles. We have also cultivated relationships with organic and fair-trade farmers collectives in Sri Lanka and Peru, and sustainable beekeepers in San Diego. Your backing will allow us to source ingredients and packaging to ship out the first run of gift boxes and to expand into new marketplaces, while supporting farmers locally and around the world.
Help us grow
With your support, we will be able to grow Maya Moon Co. in three phases:
1. Order packaging and source organic ingredients to ship the first run of gift boxes to backers.
2. Launch monthly chocolate truffle subscription program, including monthly meditations.
3. Expand into retail locations and natural markets throughout California.
Ingredients matter
Maya Moon Co.’s ingredients come from three continents, and they support healthy environments and a high quality of life for farmers and beekeepers locally and around the world.
Direct trade, organic cacao is sourced by working directly with farmers in Peru, putting more dollars in their homes and communities (rather than multiple chains of distributors). Organic stewardship fosters healthy soils, clean water and diverse, vibrant ecosystems—keys to natural balance that allows the production of healthy quantities of high quality foods, year after year.
Organic coconut products from Sri Lanka are sourced from a community collaborative that employs more than 2,000 small and medium size farmers and production workers, and invests in eco-friendly cultivation and processing practices.  
Raw honey is sourced from San Diego beekeepers who use sustainable practices, keeping bees away from harmful pesticides and herbicides. The result is healthier pollinator populations and more economic support for local beekeepers.
Each ingredient in our chocolate truffles supports wellness. Cacao is full of antioxidants for heart health and theobromine to naturally boost your mood. Creamy coconut butter is rich in healthy fats. And raw honey boosts the immune system.
Herbs, fruits and spices work to activate and balance energy centers for greater harmony in body, mind and spirit.
Chakra chocolate truffles
Chakra Chocolate Truffles are made from all-natural ingredients and sweetened with raw honey, and contain zero preservatives. They are naturally gluten free, with no dairy or refined sugars. 
We roll the decadent and creamy truffle base, made with organic cacao and coconut, in distinctive combinations of herbs, fruits and spices to create seven delicious, energy-aligning flavors.
Rooted: Raspberry Ginger
Passion: Strawberry Mango
Golden: Bee Pollen
Heart: Cinnamon
Truth: Peppermint
Vision: Triple Berry
Clarity: Vanilla Coconut
Each gift box of hand-crafted chocolate truffles includes a link to online guided meditations. Enjoyed in conjunction with each flavor, the meditations enhance the eating experience and support greater alignment in body, mind and spirit.
Get to know us
Maya Moon Co. was born out a love for chocolate and healthy food, and a vision to support thriving global ecosystems. 
When our founder, Chef Kathryn Rogers, couldn’t find decadent and nourishing treats made with high quality ingredients and zero refined sugars, she began experimenting to make her own. Over the past two years, she perfected the recipe and flavors for our Chakra Chocolate Truffles, with the help of many taste testers along the way.
The chocolate truffles were first produced in small batches for special events. Now, Maya Moon Co.'s production has grown to a 2,400-square foot commercial bakery. In addition, Kathryn has hosted Chakra Chocolate Meditation experiences with hundreds of attendees across the West Coast.
Maya Moon Co. continues to cultivate relationships with organic/sustainable farmers and beekeepers in San Diego and worldwide. Each ingredient in the chocolate truffles supports more vibrant and thriving ecosystems - starting in our own bodies and expanding to communities around the globe.
Maya Moon Co. also supports San Diego artist Sharon Belknap, who hand-carves the designs for the mantra cards inserted into each box. And each guided meditation track is produced by musician Nate Eng AKA Enigma Beats.
Our vision
We strive to create a more connected, conscious world through energy-activating chocolate truffles. We envision a thriving global ecosystem where all people, plants and animals are living open hearted and in harmony with themselves, each other and Mother Earth.
Join us in creating healthier, more vibrant (and delicious) futures for all!"
111,1901077195,"Odin’s Court (a ProgRock Records artist) prides themselves on making quality songs with strong musicianship, an “underground” approach that is contrary to the “cookie cutter” pop of the music scene in the United States today. As such, bands like Odin’s Court often struggle to make ends meet, as the music is created out of passion and love, versus a manufactured approach to make millions at the expense of killing genuine art.
The latest “single” by the band “The Warmth of Mediocrity” has attracted the most fan attention to the band yet (with its introduction of an additional vocalist and a new bassist and drummer). This song is representative of the direction the new album contains, although Odin’s Court has their usual diversity contained within the album. This fundraiser is intended to help the band see the latest, exciting project to fruition so that the band’s fans, friends, and family may enjoy what is happening in Matt Brookins’ brain (wait, do we really want people to know that?!).
Since Odin’s Court records and mixes all of their music in Brookins’ recording studio D2C Studios, this helps the band save money in a large way (plus, it allows Matt to record in his knickers – wait, he is not British); however, there are still significant expenses to release a new album. This campaign is intended to raise enough money for the CD replication, including a booklet with up to 14 pages (including cover art by selected artist JP Fournier, artist for bands such as Edguy, Avantasia, and Dragonforce). The $2,000 goal will cover this expense. It will also cover the cost to replicate the DVD described in the rewards.
There are additional expenses, such as art and mastering, so we have a stretch goal of $3500. If we reach $3500, our artist JP Fournier will not only do the planned front/rear cover art, but we will commission him to do inner tray, outer tray, CD face, and the 14-page booklet art as well!
It has been 8+ years since we made new shirts, so we have an additional stretch goal of $5500. If we reach this goal, everyone who pledges to the $25 and up level will receive an additional reward – a free shirt with new art by JP Fournier from the new album!
The album itself will contain up to 13 songs. These songs are more melodic and musical than ever, but they still contain complexities and interesting composition (for the musician and savvy music lover to appreciate under the surface). While most songs will be “shorter” in nature (e.g., less than 6 minutes), there will be one epic song at close to 20 minutes in length!
To spread out the enjoyment, the band will plan a staggered approach for delivery. This includes releasing the “reboot” EP first, the cover EP second, and the DVD and brand new CD last (sent together with other physical rewards to save shipping cost). Any “unique” (e.g., cover song of your choice) or “travel” (e.g., private show, attend a practice) rewards will be planned with each individual contributor in a staggered schedule throughout 2014.
Here is some more information about the rewards (which aside from some packages with existing albums, stack!):
Exclusive updates – these updates will include details about the new album, such as song titles, subject matter, lengths, instruments being used, etc. It will also include video updates, audio samples, and artist sketches (showing the albums’ progress and approach). This information / videos will be available through Kickstarter only.
Signed 5x7 picture of the band – a full color photo of the band in the buff, wait, never mind. We are clothed, just some of us forgot to button our shirts. We’ll sign this for you across our abs
Exclusive Digital EP – since the band lineup and some song arrangements have changed, we are rerecording some previously released songs. From Human Life in Motion: Affect Us, Silent Revolution, and Feathered We Fly; from Appalachian Court: Paradise Lost: Chapter 1 Acoustic; and from Driven by Fate: His Dark Materials
Koozie and shirt – a holder for your beverage with our name on it and a shirt from our library (Driven by Fate or …Court is Now in Session). If we hit our top stretch goal, this will also include a shirt with the new album art
New album – our latest creation as performed and captured by the new lineup at D2C Studios; mastered by C.S. Brown (Ghost Circus, Stuff Room Studios) with art by JP Fournier (Edguy, Dragonforce)
DVD – all of our music videos from over the years captured in one place. Additionally, this will contain a short live set from a festival we played in Atlanta in 2011, captured in hi-def!
Digital cover song download – some cover songs by bands that inspire us done in the Odin’s Court style. The planned list will be announced later, but will likely include some of the songs Odin's Court has played live
Private listening party – you will be invited to attend an advanced playing of the new album at D2C Studios! The band will be present and willing to sign your bare chest
Your choice of a cover song – we will record your choice of a single cover song to be delivered to you and you alone. Artists limited to Lady Gaga, Right Said Fred, or Weird Al only. Never mind, it can be any artist you want. This will be professionally recorded and mixed at D2C Studios. The song length must be roughly 6 minutes or less in length (sorry, no Dream Theater “A Change of Seasons” requests)
Witness your cover song recording – you may be present at D2C Studios with the band to observe your cover song being captured “on tape.” You can ask questions about the process, but only if you speak in Hungarian (well, Mandarin is acceptable too)
You get to play with the band – you are not only present at D2C Studios while we record your song, you are participating! What is your instrument? Bring it along (or use the studio’s selection of available gear) and perform with the band on the song. It is preferred that you play the jug and washboard, but I guess the hammer dulcimer is okay too…okay, we’ll accept other instruments (including guitar, bass, drums, keyboards, vocals, violin, etc.). We will do up to 3 takes of the song and allow you up to 3 opportunities to “punch in” or overdub parts (in other words, this cannot be an indefinite endeavor)

112,87984212,"We (Coco & Tish) were in New York and Los Angeles last year for a well deserved break for me following a mini stroke I suffered of which luckily was not that serious and fully recovered, was just a huge scare. 
Whilst they we randomly bumped into a couple of we recognised from th and got talking, long story short we got talking about our passion and dream to have our own fun chat show in a vintage style but modern twist being on the couch with the guests chatting over tea and cakes, relaxed and fun, daring and cheeky. They said if we ran a pilot on the show on a YouTube channel and had big enough support and viewing that they would love to be a guest; that was after we done a quick sample of what we had in mind. Obviously this is a big thing for us and will do whatever it takes to make this work. To get a feel for who would want to be a guest, we approached some people and we have managed to get several yes's from some well known uk actors, music artists and two uk actors who are now LA based as well as music artists that have contacted us directly. We are super excited that these people are interested but the catch being we have to fund the project ourselves meaning we need to buy the equipment which is why we ask you to please be generous with your pledges. This could really take off and need your help. The LA guests are wanting us to be available to fit in with their diaries around their filming in February 2016 so we are keeping our fingers crossed to hit our target which will cover equipment needed, all uk filming and trip to LA for 3 days to film. Please please help us get this going....."

 Prologue:
Year 2045, humans create advanced robots almost identical to humans to fight their wars. Stronger, faster and resilient ROBOTS are the ultimate war machines.
May 2045 Robots begin to rebel against humans, acting on their own. And no one can understand how.
In December of the same year the Robots declare war on humankind.
”Robots are extremely envious of humans. This was one of the, if not the, first reason they declared war against them"".
""Robots can not dream. Cyborgs can dream and even record it!""
 In September 2049 Humans where already the minority, while Robots were multiplying exponentially. They used most of the natural resources and didn't have any respect for the environment.
  The World quickly became a WASTELAND with a vigilance of Robots that looked like humans and they were after the few real humans who remained.
It happened so fast and seemed to be the end... But there was still hope.
Some groups of people created ""Anti-Robots Bunkers"" that secured survivor shelters deep in the ground. They tried to organize and fight back.
The mysterious ""SMOKE""
Some of these Bunkers were discovered by the robots, some people died of starvation, some by diseases, but there were just a few that were never found. On the Surface with the many years passing a new generation of uncivilized humans were roaming in the wasteland.
Robots captured and enslaved most of them, just for the sake of it. Forcing the savages to do barbaric things.
But once again, there was still hope...

Before the Robots found the bunker and destroy everything, 10 Cyborgs were built by a scientist called ""Doctor 00"". The ""CYBORGS"" Team was created.
This team quickly became famously known as the last hope for human kind to survive. The Robots tried to hunt and kill the Cyborgs, but this new war was far from over.

[English/Español]
Dyoo it is a project born to provide the benefits of new technologies such as facial recognition and brings this technology to all users home or business, taking care of each user's privacy.
What can Dyoo do?
Thanks to the facial recognition, we can identify people automatically; this allows Dyoo to be your virtual security guard identifying unknown people around your home.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dyoo es un proyecto que nace con el objetivo de brindar los beneficios de las nuevas tecnologías inteligentes como el reconocimiento facial y ponerlo al alcance de todos para usarlos en su hogar o negocios cuidando la privacidad de cada usuario.
¿Qué puede hacer Dyoo?
Gracias a el reconocimiento facial permite identificar personas de manera automática, lo cual le permite a Dyoo ser tu guardián virtual e identificar cuando personas desconocidas se acercan a la puerta de tu hogar.

The power to monitor your home and business in your hand

[English/Español]
Nowadays, people are in a hurry; we are busy at work, school and physical activities, many times we do not know what is happening in our homes or businesses, if our employees are working or if our family made it home yet because the truth is what really matters is our family safety.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hoy en día las personas tenemos un ritmo de vida muy ocupado, estamos ocupados en el trabajo, escuelas, actividades físicas o recreativas y debido a esto no sabemos que es lo que ocurre en nuestros hogares o negocios, si los empleados están trabajando o si nuestra familia ya está en nuestro hogar, porque lo más importante es nuestro bienestar y el de nuestros seres queridos.


[English/Español]
Currently, we are having the highest perception of insecurity in the history of Mexico, we know that not only our businesses are vulnerable but also our homes, we cannot be vigilant and taking care 24 hours a day.
We do not limit ourselves to México since anyone who wants to incorporate facial recognition into their home is only required to have Internet access.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Actualmente  estamos teniendo la percepción de inseguridad más alta en la historia de México, sabemos que no sólo nuestros negocios están vulnerables sino también nuestros hogares, no podemos estar vigilantes y cuidando las 24 horas del día.
Simplemente en México en base al estudio ENVIPIE 2018 del INEGI que  tiene estadísticas alarmantes en cuestión a seguridad como que 12 396 778 fueron hogares víctimas de algún delito de 34 773 760 estimados.
No nos limitamos solamente a México ya que cualquier persona que desee incorporar reconocimiento facial en su hogar sólo es necesario tener acceso a internet.
 How it works

[English/Español]
That's why we created Dyoo, a system that uses facial recognition with artificial intelligence algorithms to have a virtual guardian 24/7 in your home or business.
Dyoo is a cloud service accessed through a small device called DSBOX-1.
This device connects to the video surveillance system and the cloud through the Internet, sending the critical information securely to Dyoo where artificial intelligence algorithms monitor events of interest based on facial recognition.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Por eso creamos Dyoo, un sistema que utiliza reconocimiento facial con algoritmos de inteligencia artificial para tener un guardián virtual 24/7 en tu hogar o negocio.
Dyoo es un servicio en la nube al cual se accede a través de un pequeño dispositivo llamado DSBOX-1.
Este dispositivo se conecta al sistema de video vigilancia y a la nube a través de internet, enviando a Dyoo de manera segura la información clave a los algoritmos de inteligencia artificial donde se monitorearán eventos de interés basado en reconocimiento facial.

 Using the power of Artificial Intelligence

[English/Español]
Like the fingerprint, each person has specific facial biometrics that allows to differentiate them from others, which is why we develop algorithms based on an artificial intelligence vision system to extract these characteristics.
When obtaining these characteristics, we use artificial intelligence algorithms to perform facial recognition that allows Dyoo to recognise individuals.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Al igual que la huella dactilar cada persona tiene biometrías faciales específicas que nos permiten diferenciarlos de otros, por lo cual desarrollamos algoritmos basados en visión artificial para extraer estas características.
Al obtener estas características empleamos algoritmos de inteligencia artificial para realizar el reconocimiento facial que permite a Dyoo reconocer individuos. 
[English/Español]
Dyoo also can recognise between individuals and grouping them, whether the user has labeled them or not; this will helps to solve questions such as:
-How many people pass through our business?
- Does anyone watch our home?
- The delivery guy is outside our door?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dyoo permite reconocer entre individuos y agruparlos, hayan sido identificados por el usuario o no, esto ayudará a resolver preguntas como: 
-¿Cuántas personas pasan por nuestro negocio?
-¿Alguien vigila nuestro hogar?
-¿El repartidor está fuera de nuestra puerta ?


 Dyoo Cloud
[English/Español]
The events filtered by the DSBOX-1 are automatically backed up in the cloud offered by the Dyoo service, safeguarding the privacy of our users.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Los eventos filtrados por la DSBOX-1 son respaldados automáticamente en la nube que ofrece el servicio de Dyoo, resguardando la privacidad de nuestros usuarios.  
[English/Español]
We know that the most important thing is the privacy of each user, so all the videos captured by each DSBOX-1 are encrypted thus they are only visible by the system's owner and in this way has total control of their information and privacy.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sabemos que lo más importante es la privacidad de cada usuario, por lo cual todos los videos capturados por cada DSBOX-1 son encriptados, de manera  que sean únicamente visibles por el usuario que emplea el sistema y de esta manera tenga el control total de su información y privacidad.
[English/Español]
The DSBOX-1 is user-friendly since its installation is simple; it is compatible with most video surveillance cameras on the market.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
La DSBOX-1 tiene como objetivo ser amigable para cualquier usuario, ya que su instalación es sencilla, es compatible con la mayoría de las cámaras de video vigilancia del mercado. 

Dyoo's App 
[English/Español]
The Dyoo's app allows the user to generate rules to analyze relevant events and send notifications in real time of them.
- Who visits our home when we are on vacation?
-Does any stranger remain outside the home for more than 10 minutes?
- Our employees arrived on time?
-John arrived after 1 am at home?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
La aplicación permite al usuario generar reglas para analizar sucesos relevantes y mandar notificaciones en tiempo real de ellos.
-¿Quién visita nuestro hogar cuando estamos de vacaciones? 
-¿Algún desconocido permanece por más de 10 minutos fuera de nuestro hogar ?
-¿Nuestros empleados llegaron a tiempo?
-¿John llegó después de la 1 am a casa?"
115,502108073,"I have seen so many absolutely gorgeous mermaid pins that it discouraged me from even approaching the subject for quite a while.  How could I make something even cooler than what was already out there?  What did I have to add as an artist? 
The answer came to me while I was designing weapons and armor for an unrelated project.  What if there was a mermaid-themed RPG setting?  How cool would that be?!  Sure, real life hydrodynamics kind of mess things up, but this is FANTASY--it doesn't have to be real!  
So with that in mind, I began my task.  I liked the idea, but the original pin designs were so detailed and small that you couldn't really see what was going on and the faces were unreadable.  I needed them to have bigger heads... A nod to the anime/manga chibi aesthetic was a perfect solution.  So I reworked all of them into what you see today!
Each pin: 
is hard enamel.
is 1.5 inches tall (except for Octo-Die, who is 1.1 inches tall)
has gold-colored metal plating.
has two posts/clutches on the back to hold it securely in place and prevent spinning.
The lighter yellow/gold color on the mermaid pins will be recessed metal.  This technique allows for a striking end result as the edges catch the light!
Octo-Die - Unlocks with initial funding.
Sea Witch - Unlocks with initial funding.
Black Fathom - Unlocks at $1,000 
Deep Defender - Unlocks at $1,300 
Tide Breaker - Unlocks at $1,600 
Song Warden - Unlocks at $1,900
I did a fair amount of world building while working on this project.  I felt it was necessary for me to understand the overall world for which I was creating the pin designs, as well as get an idea of each mermaid's identity.  It seemed like a waste to keep all that information to myself, so here is a little bit about each class!
Fun Fact:  In this setting all mermaids are direct descendants of royalty; and thus all wear some sort of crown signifying their royal heritage.  
Octo-Die is a non-combat pet and friend to GM and PC alike. Always up for a good adventure, he is never seen without 'Old Lucky', his magic d20.   
Sea Witches are a combination ranged damage and healing class. They are usually found further away from the main action, weaving the threads of fate into damaging spells for their enemies or life-saving heals for their allies.
Black Fathoms are a high damage, low armor melee damage class. While they would be perfectly happy to stab their enemies in the face, they have learned that it is much safer to sneak around and stab them in the back.
Deep Defenders are the protective force of the party. They can take a beating, thanks to their heavy armor and shields, all the while keeping the focus of the fight on themselves through a variety of threatening and taunting tactics.
Tide Breakers are a combination melee damage and support class. Typically at home in the fray, Tide Breakers deal devastating damage with large two-handed weapons and boost their allies' stats through inspiration talents.
Song Wardens are a ranged support class with a musical flair. They tend to hang in back, boosting their parties' stats while lowering those of their opponents with the magic songs of the deep. At level 5 they can become a combination melee damage class through the 'Enchant Creature' talent.
My name is Joshua R. Pinkas and I am the creator and owner of Frost Dragon Designs, LLC. After years of working on projects for others through freelance work and private commissions, I decided to start building something for myself and started Frost Dragon Designs.  
I am a seasoned pin creator and have designed, had manufactured, and delivered hundreds of beautiful enamel pins. All of my designs are my own original creations. I start my creative process with traditional drawings in sketchbooks. Even the simplest of designs will usually go through a dozen or more revisions before I recreate it digitally and prepare the files to send to my manufacturers.  
I love launching new projects on Kickstarter because this is where I got my start with my company, and because I have found a wonderfully supportive community here who genuinely care about creatives.

Child Z by award winning playwright, Sarah Hehir, is a hard hitting new play which gives voice to a young girl trapped at the centre of a child grooming ring.  It is powerful, provocative and timely, contributing to one of the most sensitive and controversial public debates of the moment. 
Sarah was galvanized into writing Child Z in response to the Rochdale child grooming scandal in 2009. Despite many opportunities to intervene, social workers, police and the CPS repeatedly failed to protect the girls involved. The play has been informed by extensive research and interviews with the father of the girl at the centre of the Rochdale case as well as the crisis intervention worker who worked closely with many of the girls and gave evidence to Keith Vaz's select committee into the Rochdale case.
'It's good to know my difficult interview with an appallingly abused young woman has inspired such a play.'   Dame Jenni Murray (Woman's Hour Radio 4)
CHILD Z will have productions in London and the North of England in June 2015 and will take the CHILD Z Platform of workshops to Birmingham Rep, Icon Theatre Medway, Canterbury College, The ID Project Swale, The Will Adams Centre, Gillingham, North Lincolnshire and Abraham Moss School Manchester. More venues to be confirmed.

‘It is hard to describe the appalling nature of abuse that child victims suffered. They were raped by multiple perpetrators, trafficked to other cities in the North of England, abducted, beaten and intimidated. There were examples of children who had been doused in petrol and threated they’d be set alight, threatened with guns,made to witness violently brutal rapes and threatened they would be next if they told anyone. Girls as young as 11 were raped by large numbers of male perpetrators.’ (Independent Inquiry into CSE in Rotherham 97-2013, Alexis Jay OBE)"

Hello,
Just before you move on to read about the campaign content, I want to thank every single backer who has helped us reach target this morning! We have so much news and activity to share with you and rewards will be dispatched in the next few days. 
Today, I can reveal that we are absolutely delighted to be programmed in this year's Vaults Festival London. This will be our first performance of Giving Up Marty and we are so excited to be included in this incredible festival, a great platform for this work. 
As we are down to the final few hours of crowd-funding here, I'm not specifying stretch goals, but the more we can invest in marketing the play and the potential to live stream a performance, so more people see it, will cost. So forgive me, not detailing the numbers, as I wasn't sure today would happen or not, but we are a creative team of eight people and this campaign was always to support the start of this project. We have grant applications to go. Thank you so very much for making this happen. We still have some lovely rewards to offer anyone who would like to pledge today. 
THANK YOU!!

WHY I WROTE THE PLAY
I am adopted and was reunited with my birth family many years ago. Every storyline I have ever seen on television, film and to a lesser extent stage (if, at all), has never resonated one ounce of truth for me. 
I am not alone. 
We received an Arts Council grant last year to research and develop the play. We played to Coram (adoption charity) - the response was overwhelming with so many adopted people and families associated with adoption grateful for a play that spoke a truth!
The play, like most of my writing, contains a humorous touch. You couldn't get through this subject without it. I have written the play to encourage people to think about adoption, specifically reunion which rarely has the fairytale ending, so often depicted in media and televised dramas. But the play is also not without hope, love, and reaffirmation.
Now, I want to bring to the stage with an amazingly talented creative team, a story that resonates and is respectful to everyone connected with adoption. The play also speaks to a wider audience and the relationships within the play are just as relevant to non-adopted families. This is a universal play and one we really want to share with you!
(Note:  all quotes are taken from our audience members at Coram, Paines Plough Roundabout and Soho Theatre).  
Dorothy Lawrence (MARTHA) & Danny Hetherington (JOEL)
WHY DOES THIS PLAY MATTER...?
We want to challenge the myths and perceptions held about adoption and we believe it's time for an authentic voice on the subject. We believe theatre is the most powerful way to tell this story. It can act as a catalyst for change and influence legislation to improve anyone's life affected by adoption. 
'I found the play very powerful, I texted my daughter when I arrived at Coram to say I was nervous, the message back said ‘Mummy, I’m proud of you, this is your world.’ So right'. 
Danny Hetherington (JOEL) & Alexi Leighton (KIT)
IS IT JUST FOR ADOPTED PEOPLE....?
No. It's for everyone. In our R&D we produced rehearsed readings for adoption and non-adoption audiences at Coram, Soho Theatre and Paines Plough Roundabout. It was partly to see if the play worked beyond the adoption community and, to our delight, it was received with equal enthusiasm. In every family, whether adopted or non-adopted there is a dynamic, a tension, love and curiosity; it's not unique to adoption, it's part of our human experience.  Giving up Marty is a story for everyone. 
'Joel's journey is really a rollercoaster of emotions and situations. The character is extremely relatable even for an audience member who has not experienced adoption.'
Annie Sutton - DIRECTOR - Karen Bartholomew - PLAYWRIGHT
THE TOUR
Spring 2020
This will be our first tour of ten performances to theatres and non theatre venues in the South East region. We want to extend our audience reach and provide accessible programming. Our charity performance will be with Coram (London) and open to professionals and the general public. Each venue will be offered a facilitator led post-show discussion and drama workshops (subject to funding) exploring themes of identity, connection, displacement and the myriad of complexities that adoption throws up. We will also be offering a paid Intern position for a young person who has been in the care system who is interested in forging out a career in professional theatre. 
'Congratulations to all! I’m looking forward to seeing this play in its entirety. It’s not an issue that’s covered in this way very often. Secrets and Lies was the last thing I can connect this topic to and I feel this whole area of adoption needs more of this kind of intelligent and truthful exploration and discussion'.
Ugo Nelson (FEMI)
THE FUTURE
This tour will leverage us into a stronger position to secure production support, work with an established producer, capital to tour the UK, link internationally, primarily with the USA who have a very different adoption system to the UK. We will invite international companies to consider an exchange programme with us, to share and learn more about each other's cultural, political and social practices of adoption. Motormouse Productions are committed to a long-term involvement with the adoption community, providing valuable workshops, panel speaker involvement, and a future book from the playwright about her own adoption reunion story. 
'Anything that demystifies adoption is good thing'. 
WHERE YOU MAKE THE DIFFERENCE
Our backers are a significant part of this journey. It's your support that can allow this production to happen. We'd love you to be a part of the difference we truly believe this play can make. We hope you can come and see the play, and meet us, we'd love to say thank you in person.
If this campaign is successfully funded, it means we can guarantee putting the play on! This would contribute to a vast chunk of our artistic spending budget, meaning we can pay the actors and crew to produce the show. We are in the process of funding bids which would allow us to expand upon the planned tour listed. However your pledge will allow us to rehearse the play in London and provide the necessary resources to run ten performances with post show discussion. We offer a variety of exciting rewards and, for our most generous supporters, an invitation to our Launch Party!
Your pledges are simply that important. Thank you!
Our R&D was funded by Arts Council England, Really Useful Group, Kent Arts Investment Award and Unity Trust Theatre.

DOROTHY LAWRENCE - playing MARTHA the birth mother. Dorothy has worked as an actress in theatre, TV and film since the 80's. Throughout her acting life, Dorothy has been passionate about new work, running a parallel career as a theatre-maker. She is a founder member of The Lions part and one of the co-devisors of hit show, Lilies on the Land, which ran in the West End and toured the UK many times. - I was attracted to Giving Marty because it gives voice to a story you may think you have heard before but then it goes off in a direction you were not expecting. It is relentless in its honesty and I like to tell tough stories. Karen’s writing is robust, spare and gutsy and her play takes no prisoners. I hope the audience will come away appreciating just how complex the subject of Adoption is.'
HANNAH WOOD - playing MELISSA, the birth sister. Hannah was born and bred in Newcastle upon Tyne and trained at Birmingham School of Acting.Credits include: Downton Abbey (ITV), series regular Matilda in Home Front (BBC Radio 4), and was a member of the BBC Radio Drama Company, performing in numerous radio plays for BBC.

UGO NELSON - playing the FEMI, the social worker. I'm an actor across both stage and screen, currently working on the final parts of a my web series Vaude Ville. Having been part of the team that completed the initial R&D phase for Giving Up Marty, I am hugely honoured and excited to be moving forward with Motormouse Productions and this ambitious, quintessentially human project. As an actor/writer, I have a real appreciation for the strength of a story, and one like this about a little-known, never discussed corner of our society is a truly magical experience to be involved in, and a topic we'll all strive to handle with the delicacy it deserves.
DANNY HETHERINGTON - playing JOEL, the adopted son. Graduated from the Royal Central school of Speech and Drama in 2016. Recent theatre credits include Roseline (directed by Ross Drury) and Midsummer Night’s Dream (directed by Claire Dunlop) and most recently Bentley Drummle in Great Expectations (directed by Phil Wilmot). When cast in Giving up Marty I was delighted to be part of a team telling such an important and necessary story that sheds light on specific realities of adoption and reunions which seem to be so often neglected on screen.
ALEXI LEIGHTON - playing KIT, the adoptive mother. I have worked as an actress and director performing at Citizens Theatre, Tron Theatre, Northampton Theatre Royal, Theatre 503, Drill Hall, BBC Films and STV. Always attracted to new writing and innovative subject matter, I was thrilled to be cast as Kit, the adoptive mother, in Giving up Marty. The project had a strong appeal as the subject matter has personal resonance and I relished the challenge of being involved in the R&D process. Giving up Marty gives a voice to all the protagonists in what is a very complex and emotionally charged issue. I look forward to their stories being told.

118,458184835,"What is it?
...a Project to realize and freely distribute dozens, maybe hundreds, of original 3D models. This work — created over the last several years — is currently hanging around on my hard disks in varying degrees of finish & refinement. Radio Free MeshWorks seeks funding to complete the models and make them freely available to the public — as digital 3D models — under Creative Commons Licensing.
Note: For a better look at some of the images in the video above, please drop by: The Radio Free MeshWorks Pre-Launch Site
Most of the models are already well developed — about to the stage of modeling and preliminary meshes as seen it the top row of the image below. The goal is to bring them to a level of refinement and finish seen it the bottom row, and prepare .OBJ-formatted meshes suitable for use by other modelers & artists. 
Alright, who's responsible for this?
I'm Darrel Anderson, a lifelong designer & scribble explorer. I first came to art as a means of realizing & visualizing ideas — only to discover that art could be a tool for discovering ideas.
The pursuit of ideas & imagery — and creating art tools that aid it — has kept me busy for a few decades (starting long before I ever touched a computer).
Here's my informal Bio/CV.
An Agile Old Pioneer
…at least I like to think so — regarding the agile bit — nothing I can do about the old part. My first professional, published digital illustrations & 3D content date back to the mid 80's — 3D Content for the Atari ST & Antic's Cad3D (Cad 3D soon after evolved into 3D Studio, and 3D Studio Max). However, there is nothing nostalgic or legacy about the works in this project. While certainly drawing on my decades of work and play with 3D design, these are all recent works.
Toolmaker
I created my first Digital Art Tools (perhaps a stretch to call them 'Graphics Applications') in the early 80's — first published 3D tools were part of the original IPAS 3D Studio plug-ins — around 1990. My current, ongoing graphics tool project is GroBoto — a unique and playful/artistic tool for designing & creating 3D models. GroBoto was the primary tool used for all of the models in this project.
Why not?
Why do I want to give away this original intellectual property?
Because I'm mortal, and the work need not be.
Because — try 'tho i might — I can't work 100 hours a week.
Because of a lifetime subscription to the idea of artistic collaboration.
There is no way I'll ever realize the full potential of this work. It's a wonderful property of digital art — especially 3D models — that once the modeling is done, countless variations can be derived. Texturing, lighting, scene creation, additional modeling, inclusion in other 3D scenes, animation — all lead to new works. Even if I had infinite time and energy, solo development of the work would never be as rich and varied as the collaborative results.
It would be a waste to leave this work languishing in virtual closets (my hard drives & CDs) — with just a smattering of images, scattered across the web, being the extent of their realized potential. Getting this work into the hands of other Artists, Modelers & Animators skirts that foolishness.
The work's value is in the ideas, imagination and love put into each piece.
The value is in its potential.
That value is best extracted by freely sharing the work and inviting other creative people to explore, expand & enhance it.
Why Kickstarter?
I need help. GroBoto, the primary tool used in the creation of all of the models in this project, eats up much of my time these days. I will personally do the creative work needed to get the models ready for release, but there are big technical tasks, and small administrative tasks, that need doing as well.
KickStarter funding will not be paying for the original work-to-date (which amounts to 1000's of hours). Rather, it's for the completion, refinement, reworking and delivery of existing models — everything needed to make them useful & available to other artists, designers, modelers and animators.
Setting the Work Free
Over the course of a year (starting January 1, 2013 if funding is in place by that date), at least 60 original models will be readied for free distribution (see Stretchy-ness below).
Form & Function
All models will ultimately be saved and distributed as meshes in the Wavefront (.OBJ), file format. All of the work already exists as 3D digital models — as GroBoto models and/or meshes. Some are very nearly ready to go, most will receive further modeling refinement and/or detailing prior to release. That final refinement usually happens in modo®, 'tho some ZBrush® work may be in the mix.
The finished models — in .OBJ format — will be made available through the project's website, and we will invite all major 3D sites (forums, developer/publisher sites, CG news sites, etc. to join in the distribution). All of the final models produced will be free under Non-Commercial Creative Commons Licensing. Specifically, the 'Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike' license as described here:
http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/
Commercial Licenses are one of the project's rewards. See the Rewards section below for details.
Decisions, Decisions...
There are more than 60 designs to choose from. The majority of the models featured in our Kickstarter presentation (Video and other materials) will be released — others, not shown, may be included as well. We will seek feedback from Backers throughout the project to make certain popular works are produced and released. If the project exceeds its Kickstarter goal, we will add more models (see Stretchy-ness below).
S t r e t c h y - n e s s
We are committing to the release of at least 60 models (shooting for a bit better than one per week over a one year period). If KickStarter funding exceeds our initial goal, we will include more models, released at a faster pace. We hope that the project will continue, become self-sustaining, and ultimately include completely new works and works by other artists.
Rewards

•
GroBoto 3D App
GroBoto v4 — $50 to $250 Rewards
GroBoto is the software used for the initial design & modeling of all of the models in this project. Make your own stuff, discover that 3D modeling can be playful & exploratory — a place to think, see & invent.
Please See the GroBoto website for more info
•
3D Prints
Limited Edition 3D Prints — $350 to $2000 Rewards
Three designs — each in two sizes, and several materials — are be available as rewards. You chose the design & material, size is based on the reward level.
EnzoMite
EnzoAeronaut
Clockwork GoggleHead
The renderings below are simulations of the 3D Prints ...and I'm still working on the models.  
I thought it would be fun to share the evolution of these pieces over the course of the project. Please stay tuned to our Kickstarter update pages for progress and photos of test prints. As you can see, EnzoAeronaut is a hybrid of EnzoMite &  Clockwork GoggleHead ...a wonderful bit of serendipity, so common in digital 3D — illuminating why getting these designs out there in the artistic mix so vital.
Tea Stains?
The Tea Staining technique (see below) is new to me — yes, it literally means staining with tea. I've used it before on different materials, but not on any sort of 3D print. I was inspired to include it after seeing this work.
I'll post my tea-stain test results in updates here. Seems like it will be fine. If it doesn't look viable for any reason, I'll remove it as an option — but thought it was too cool not to try.
Total edition of each Design is 50: 
30 copies at approximately  11.0 cm • 4.3 in. 
20 copies at approximately 15.3 cm • 6.0 in. 
Sizes vary slightly with each design.
To honor the Limited Edition, these specific versions of Clockwork GoggleHead and the two Enzo's will not be among the freely distributed project models. Different versions of the same concepts will be released as Radio Free Meshworks models.  ...which makes sense anyway — 3D printing and useful models for rendering, animation, etc. have different requirements.
•
Publishing Rights
Commercial Publishing Rights Rewards — $1400 to $2000 Rewards
Need an original design for your own creative endeavors? These rewards allow you to choose from any of the models and concepts in this project.
These rewards give you International, unlimited, perpetual, commercial publishing rights.
Non-Commercial Creative Commons Licensing is provided as part of Radio Free Meshwork's model distribution. That means all commercial licensing will be — by definition — non-exclusive. However, commercial licensing is available — and that's what these rewards offer. 
Wrap it Up already...
Broadly Brushed Closing Bits...
Collaboration & sharing of ideas, tools, techniques is cool, satisfying & productive — it's been at the heart of my artistic life since the days of graphite & linseed oil.  Early on — when computer graphic imaging was mostly a nerdish hobby — generosity & collaboration thrived.
CGI is now intertwined with the mega-million dollar industries of gaming, film, and advertising. That influx of cash and human resources has lead to extraordinary advances ...a wonderful development. Nevertheless, a current of sharing still flows beneath that costly surface, and — through this project — I hope to be a tributary. 
What's GroBoto got to do, got to do with it?
Everything and nothing. GroBoto is a 3D app I built with a couple of friends. It was used as the primary design and modeling tool for every model in this project (most have had, or will have, additional work in other 3D apps). This Kickstarter project has nothing to do with GroBoto development — rather, it's entirely about the art, designs & ideas."
119,1628973098,"ALL STRETCH GOALS UNLOCKED!
ALL PLEDGES OF 6 ITEMS OR MORE WILL RECEIVE A MYSTERY SECONDS PIN FROM THIS COLLECTION!
I’m Charlotte, owner / designer of Alice Vitrum. This is my third Kickstarter and I am focusing on one of my passions; the Wizarding World and its greatest headmaster including enamel pins, tote bags, socks, vinyl stickers and A6 prints!
The initial funding goal is for the sherbet lemon pin only. If we exceed that, I can start unlocking the below stretch goals!
The project will be due to be finished within 20 days ending on the 21st of January in hopes that all items backed will be ordered from the manufacturer as soon as possible! With this in mind, I hope to ship everything within March
Pledge RISK FREE and PAY LATER
*** Pledges are not collected from Kickstarter until after the campaign ends giving you opportunity to amend, increase or decrease your pledge throughout the time the campaign is active! Pledge now to secure your items at discounted rates and pay at the end! You will only be charged after the 21st of January. If we don't reach our initial goal you will not be charged!! ***
If we unlock stretch goals you will have the chance to select which designed pins or accessories bag that you would like out of the designs that have been unlocked.  Stretch goals can’t be unlocked without active pledging so if there is a design you want – pledge for more! This will increase the likeliness that goals will be unlocked.
To change your pledge tier OR pledge amount; click on ""Manage Your Pledge"". Then click ""Change your pledge"" - this will allow you to change the reward tier or pledge amount!
Why pledge?
By pledging, you will receive exclusive prices and discounts that won’t be seen on my shop! For this Kickstarter, I have given each tier a discount so that the more pins you pledge for, the more you will save! Once these designs are funded and uploaded to the shop, they will be £7-10 per individual item – so you have the opportunity to get one or two pins free at certain tier levels! This includes the tote bag / socks rewards! You will simply be able to select the bag as part of your reward survey instead of pins at the end.
Every pledge will include vinyl stickers and higher tiered pledges will receive an A6 print – saving you even more!
SHIPPING
Shipping amounts have been calculated to cover socks and tote bags if chosen in reward surveys. There will be an opportunity to upgrade your shipping in your reward survey after funding ends!
If your parcel is lighter than anticipated I will automatically upgrade your shipping but please leave your paypal email in the reward surveys just in case!
Info on pledges:
Pledging towards this Kickstarter enables me to raise funds towards the manufacturing process. Having to buy the pins / totes in bulk to be able to sell them at an affordable price can sometimes be difficult, however pledging helps to bring these designs to life. The majority of the money from the pledges puts the items into production. The remaining money will go towards packaging, individual stickers and a percentage goes to Kickstarter for allowing me to run this campaign!  
The Kickstarter rewards have been priced so that the more you pledge for, the more you save! Even pledging for two pins and/or a tote bag gives you a very small discount and allows you to save money overall.  
This Kickstarter is for one initial design, where there will be the opportunity of adding 13 extra stretch goals! It is a bit ambitious however if any designs are not funded, they will be made into reward stickers at the end of the campaign so that each illustration is brought to life!  
At the end of the campaign you will have the chance to choose exactly what designs you want to grab out of those that have been unlocked. In the above banner and information, you will be able to see exactly what is available – unlocked designs will be in bright colours, whereas locked designs will be dimmed with a lock symbol below. 
What are the stretch goals?
Sherbet lemon pin - £250 - FUNDED
Socks pin - £500 - FUNDED
Phoenix pin - £800 - FUNDED

£66,666 Extended Hacking - Funded!!!
Look at you, hacker, a pathetic creature of meat and bone... Go full rogue with extended hacking perks, letting you take over bots, unlock camera feeds, get access to more restricted resources and reveal more of the story. This will involve an ASCII minigame, and those that choose to specialise in this area will find themselves with a more varied gameplay pace.

£70,000 Pure mode
No story, no branching areas, nothing to distract you from kills after kills. This is a streamlined mode for the most gameplay obsessed players. We’ll also throw in more challenge modes and achievements!

£75,000 New zone: Io
Have an optional route through Jupiter’s most violent moon, Io. Rivers of lava, moonquakes, unstable mining machinery, new environmental hazards and some tough as Hell enemies will make this a special challenge for our more extreme players.

£80,000 Audio Logs
Many log files will now be in audio version rather than just text. This is better for gameplay, as you can listen to the files as you continue to play instead of taking a break from blood-soaked mayhem. You can also access all audio files discovered across all games through an archive menu.

£90,000 New zone: Space Station
Have an optional route through a claustrophobic space station, with scientific research facilities and a better chance of finding some of the more exotic items in the game. Just be careful of some of the more exotic creatures you might find...

£100,000 Procedural Weapon Variations
Borderlands 2 has a Guinness World Record for the number of weapons it has, at 12.4 million. Think we can beat that? Does it even make sense to? Maybe not… Regardless, with this goal we can increase weapon variety by designing and coding procedural variations, with some exotic weapons having particular strange mixes of abilities. They’ll also look cooler!

£110,000 New zone: Ganymede
Have an optional route through the vast facilities of Ganymede. This will be one of the more randomised zones in the game, with an unpredictable mix of facility types and a range of possible enemy encounters.

£130,000 Procedural Enemy Variations
If we’re successful enough we can build a procedural enemy variation system, with different components to each monster type. This will be reinforced with different stats, behaviour and special effects associated with certain variations.

£150,000 Full Procedural Destruction
While many elements in the game world (crates, furniture, doors, etc) will be destructible by default, this tier will allow us to invest both in the art and technology needed to unlock full procedural destruction, enabling you to leave no wall untouched. Just try not to blast yourself into space... 

Further stretch goals will be announced the closer we get to the end of the campaign!
Jupiter Hell is a tactical roguelike game in a 90's flavored sci-fi universe. Set on the moons of Jupiter, the game pits a lone space marine against overwhelming demonic forces. Rip and tear undead, demons and unmentionable monstrosities, using classic weaponry including shotguns, chainguns, railguns and the trusty chainsaw. All to the shine of CRT monitors and the tune of heavy metal!
Dive deep into a true form of the 30 year old roguelike game genre that has resurged in popularity. Experience turn-based, grid-based permadeath and fully procedural levels, all in glorious 3D visuals. Get ready for the spiritual successor to D**mRL, the parody roguelike that years ago streamlined the traditional format and popularised a new wave of accessible roguelikes. Distilled, hardcore gameplay, fast-paced challenge and limitless death all await!
Welcome to Jupiter Hell. 
Classic roguelike! - Turn-based, grid based, procedurally generated environments and permadeath. 
Several difficulty levels and dozens of challenge modes - no matter what skill level, there will be always something more to achieve, something nastier to master 
Dynamic animation system - despite being turn-based, you never wait for the player to move, play as fast as you like and see the animation adapt to it 
Streamlined UI and gameplay - no need for manuals, just jump in. Whether you want the easy way of playing by mouse, or the fast way by keyboard, the game offers both. 
G(l)orious visuals - explosions, blood, dynamic shadows, effects galore. 
Randomness! - from the big to the small, Jupiter Hell will never feel samey - the plot and missions will vary each game, the procedural levels will provide new tactical challenges, and even small finishing touches like background furniture will have variety to give a handmade feel. 
Loot - Raid corpses and plunder secret corporate storehouses for kick-ass new weapons and armour.
For a hands-on feel of what Jupiter Hell's gameplay will feel like, you can download and play for free its predecessors, D**mRL and AliensRL. Whilst Jupiter Hell will be deeper and more visually appealing, it will use much of the same mechanics and game design ideas.
Jupiter Hell, despite its appearance, adheres to all the traditional rules of the Roguelike genre. It is turn-based, grid-based, has permadeath, and features randomly generated environments. Hell, it even has a pure ASCII mode!
ASCII version (WIP)
But that doesn’t stop it being accessible, with intuitive UI, flowing gameplay and polished aesthetics. We are truly aiming to bring classic roguelike gameplay into a modern gaming environment.
For those unfamiliar with the traditional roguelike formula, it offers an engaging and replayable gameplay experience vastly different from most modern games. Permadeath, the deletion of your character save after death, means that decisions really matter and threats feel absolutely real. Randomised content makes each playthrough feel different, and adds unknowns and tensions as you explore the computer generated environments. The combination of these makes you focus on the gameplay in ways that transcend most genres.
Jupiter Hell is turn-based, but with an adaptive animation system that lets you play at your own pace. You can dash through easy areas and mow through simple enemies in fractions of a second, but then stop to properly think and plan when meaty challenges rear their head. It also features resource management and decision-based character progression to add further tactical and strategic depth.
The roguelike genre has lasted for decades with a dedicated core following, and roguelike elements have found a resurgence in popularity in recent years. Jupiter Hell will bring the classic formula to new audiences and make a new generation addicted to death.
A mega-corporation conducting mining operations across the Jovian moons has somehow opened up a gate to… somewhere else. A lone marine is now the only one who can stand against the demonic forces of Hell and shut the gate before they overwhelm the whole Solar System.
The game starts with the player, a lone marine, arriving at a base on Callisto and being confronted by demonically possessed former soldiers. The player will shoot, blast and chainsaw their way across the moons of Jupiter, discovering the secrets of corporate money-grabbers and ancient cults, before arriving at Dante Station, a mysterious structure in orbit above Jupiter’s Red Spot.  
You can find more details and depths of the story and how it will be told in Update #2.
Jupiter Hell will be available for Windows, Linux and MacOS on Steam and later hopefully on GOG.com.
Vote for us in our Greenlight campaign to get Jupiter Hell to Steam!
Jupiter Hell is built from the ground up on an entirely custom engine. It includes dynamic lighting, quick procedural composition, and most importantly an animation system which adapts to the speed of your keypresses, letting you play entirely at your own pace. The custom engine also gives us much greater flexibility in development than anything off the shelf.
Development of Jupiter Hell is centered in Wroclaw, Poland, but we have an international team dedicated to crafting a polished and widely appealing game. 
Jupiter Hell is not the sort of game you will see funded by any AAA publisher. It is niche, daring and unrepentant in its goals to produce a highly polished traditional roguelike. We believe there is demand for this and with the right support it can achieve huge popularity. Kickstarter lets us both prove this and gain all the necessary funding to get the project through development.
Crowdfunding is also a wonderful way of bringing together dedicated supporters and getting them involved in the game development journey. Roguelikes traditionally are made and polished over many years with significant community involvement, including testing and ideas generation. Using Kickstarter lets us build a community rapidly and shape the game’s development around what you, the players, want to see. 
Backer forum includes access to development polls when we face a particularly troubling decision in terms of game design.
Get EARLY ACCESS to the game once it goes live on Steam or wait a bit and get a DRM free key at full release! Includes access to the backer forum with development polls.
Rock and roll to the heavy metal tunes of Roland La Goy, not only when slaying Demons!
Feast your eyes on the full process of visual creation in Jupiter Hell, from early sketches, through more and more detailed concept art, to finished digital paintings, both used and unused in the game.
Help us shape the game! Gain access to the BETA, which will follow the initial ALPHA and INNER CIRCLE period. In BETA we will be still shaping major parts of the game, and will ask you for in depth feedback and suggestions! BETA forums will be hidden to allow us to easier go through *ALL* the suggestions. BETA is expected to start mid-2017.
You want to be remembered and we’ll help you with that! Your name and surname will be put on the list of random starting soldier names (if the player doesn’t type anything, or presses random).
If you’re willing to help us one step further, we’ll not only add your name to the credits list in a SUPPORTERS section, but you’ll get a *SIGNED* postcard from us, directly from hell. Jupiter Hell.
Name in credits and soldier creation not enough? Fear not, we’ve got you covered! Your name will be added to the list of usable names in the random assignment/mission database. In this game, everyone is dead. However, you will see your name in an e-mail on a terminal, or on a randomly found memo. This is pot luck though, one game you might be a hero, many games later a villain! If you don’t want to reveal your name, you can use a chosen name/surname with your callsign (subject to approval).
ALPHA access starts at least 6 weeks before BETA, so we hope it will start around April 2017. Many parts of the game will still be in flux, and your suggestions in the alpha forums are guaranteed to be taken into account by the development team. This is a prime level if you want to have a tangible effect on the game! To celebrate that, you’ll be listed as an ALPHA TESTER in the credits. Link for the Thank You section is subject to screening (no scams, porn, gambling etc).
Throughout the game you will be able to find special “treasure chests” in the form of … dead fellow marines. When looting them you’ll recover collectible dog tags bearing short inscriptions. Backers at this tier get to choose the tag name and the inscription. Collecting them all throughout several playthroughs will be a game Achievement!
You’ll also get an EXCLUSIVE KICKSTARTER ONLY PHYSICAL JUPITER HELL poster to remind you of this campaign! These will be super rare items. Shipping is on us!

You get access to the prestiguous INNER CIRCLE forums where the earliest prototypes are posted. You’ll get access to our current builds, as soon as we wrap up kickstarter, and the Arena Mode in January. You’ll help us shape the systems of the game and contribute to ongoing development. Quite possibly, there’ll be bits in the final game where you’ll be able to say -- it’s thanks to me! To celebrate that you’ll also be listed in the Design Consultant section of the credits.

You’ll also get an EXCLUSIVE KICKSTARTER ONLY PHYSICAL JUPITER HELL poster to remind you of this campaign! These will be super rare items. Shipping is on us!
You’ll get a physical softcover artbook which will include concept art, early models, some of our favourite final shots from the game, and a photo of Kornel working very hard on coding. Signed if you want!
You choose the name of a weapons/armor manufacturer in the game. Think Kalashnikov, H&K, or e-sport players branded game tech! We cannot guarantee it will be a very common item brand, and the name is subject to approval.

Also, you’ll become a ChaosForge VIP. If you’re in the neighbourhood (yeah, we know Wroclaw in Poland is far away), you’re welcome to a studio tour! If we ever hold any GDC, PAX of whatever private or public party, you’ll be invited :)
Come up with a poster, be it of your own game, product or corporation, either submit it to us, or send us a concept. We’ll “Jupiter Hell”-ize it, and with your approval it will appear sometimes instead of the standard Callisto base posters. Oh, and we’ll print it and stick it into the poster package too!

Additionally, your artbook will be Hardcover!
Help us design and name an enemy or weapon of your choice. Send us an idea, or closely work with us on the execution, your choice. We’ll need to make sure that it fits the game, but we’ll work hard for that to happen!

122,580643714,"What’s the story?
In the age of big data, when advertisers know more about you than you know about yourself, there are certain personal experiences that aren’t being tracked. In response to the drive to record every detail of every action a person takes, we are focusing on what remains untouched, starting with the most intimate: the kiss. Through careful scrutiny of her memories and journals, Galen has collected data for her first kiss with every person she’s kissed—from their biographical information to how much she enjoyed it—which John transformed into interactive graphs for you, the user, to manipulate. The result is an infographic, an experimental narrative, and a digital performance piece rolled into one.
A graphic breakdown of the age and sign of everyone the artist kissed
We’re walking the line between digital and print media, poetry and visuals, art and design, and data points and story-telling. We were inspired by the trendng use of infographics to illustrate statistical data, most of which is large-scale and impersonal. Combining this trend with Galen’s faithful journaling through the years creates a story through data without the storytelling essentials—no villain, no conflict, no contrived resolution. We do have the Who, What, Where, When, and Why of a story, but it’s up to the reader to manipulate the data in a way that’s meaningful for you. Kiss List asks the question: How does breaking people and experiences down into data points affect the stories we generate? What can we learn from isolated facts, and what narratives are left untold?
The breakdown of one individual kiss
What will my money fund?
The money we raise here will fund the costs necessary for completing Kiss List, including hosting the site for the next year. In addition to creating the website, we are printing a Kiss List book. This book will further explore the narrative possibilities of statistical research in a beautiful, full-color publication. We are planning a launch of the whole project in Chicago this February. The launch, which will take place at an independently-owned bookstore, will include a reading, live music, and rented ipads where audience members can explore the site.
Your money will allow us to:
Keep the site running for the next year
Professionally publish a printed book version of the website
Produce a launch event
Kiss enjoyment versus communication after the fact
Why should I fund you?
Kiss List is Etc. Gallery’s first endeavor, and we hope it is the first of many. We created Kiss List as a labor of love, but we need your support to continue our work. In order to launch additional projects, we have to know that they will have an audience. By supporting us now, you are promoting our future."
123,1602973289,"Are you vanillaist?
Vanillaism is a series of social enterprises based in Bali working all across rural Indonesian communities bringing support, education and opportunities by our innovative pay it forward adoption and sponsoring schemes. We want to showcase beautiful Bali to our supporters when they visit Indonesia and spread vanilla activism through tourism...
Vanillaists are vanilla oracles teaching the world how to be better humans through the medium of sustainable organic farming in developing nations. Our concept evolved because we wanted to help small scale farmers in Bali and Java to prevent watershed ecology, improve water table and prevent soil erosion. 
Vanillaism is a chance to invest in your children and your grandchildren's future, which will reduce your carbon footprint to zero when our carbon neutrality is certified.
Rice Paddy, Beautiful Bali
From many field visits to farms, rice terraces and rainforest all across Bali whilst discussing the problems communities face we now see planting vanilla vines as a gateway crop to help farmers work their way out of poverty and to help us help the environment by supporting their work. Removing the unscrupulous middle men vanilla traders we offer a much better price to farmers which gives them the opportunity to work their way up the social ladder and send their children to university. We walk the talk, we do not just pay lip service to sustainability! 
Vanillaism is the gateway to be that difference!!
Who we are
Who are we? We are the Vanillaist movement. A non religious almost-cult for people who want to make a difference. Through our water conservation projects across Indonesia we are conserving water, assisting natural regeneration of deforested areas, offering educational opportunities for local indigenous farming communities all through the medium of growing vanilla vines and producing pods and other craft items from our farmer's crops.
Chief Vanillaist
Indonesia is critical in the fight against global warming and the effects of climate change on Earth. There is no plan(et B), we must do more to protect the one that we have. They are a truly magical gift which we must protect and conserve for future generations.
What do we believe in??
Fairness, social inclusion, tolerance, body positivity, mental health positivity, education, openness, mindfulness, yoga, freedom, sharing, helping others, organic principles, good vanilla vibes, meditation, blessings, ceremony, culture, tourism, activism, positive change, farm to fork, farming co-operatives, everything in moderation, eat local think global, sustainability...
Our list is constantly evolving, but all we ask if you join the movement that you promote the cause selflessly because you want to not only make a difference but #BEthatdifference.
Where does your money go?
Preserving community skills for future generations
Every contribution helps  our communities not only plant vanilla vines and other crops, but pays the farmers to tend the vines and teach them how to grow the best pods.
Then we cure and condition those pods and we create other employment opportunities to produce the most consistent, top quality pods with the highest vanillin content in the market. 
Controlling every aspect of production allows us to create true ""rainforest to fork"" vanilla pods.
These pods help build long term sustainable growth for the community you are supporting.
We urge you to ask your vanilla supplier where the pods come from. If they can't answer basic questions then ask yourself why??
Sustainable Teak Coaster
Can I see what you are doing on the spot? 
We are building our series of Vanilla tours which will be available in January 2019 where we will take our supporters out in the field. Learn all about the magical vanilla orchid, see the difference your support is making in the communities. Meet the people you are helping and have a once in a lifetime vacation that money can almost just about buy! 
From Vanillaism HQ your tour will visit our orchards, where you can ask Qs about the area, enjoy fresh coconut, snake-fruit, mangosteen right from the tree. Learn about rainforest management, eco system diversification, water conservation from one of our agro ecologists and take more amazing pictures than you can ever imagine!
We can reverse the effects of climate change, but Indonesia's rainforests are the lungs of our planet and we need to help them to help us!!

 95% of the funds that are raised will go directly into the production of the game. Finally, 5% is paid to Kickstarter for providing their services.
Why KickStarter
With the Kickstarter community’s help, we will deliver a game you’ve never seen before. This game will be released as a quality product, but with your help, we can improve it and maybe even expand our team.
Turning to Kickstarter ensures that we have access to a constant stream of feedback and ideas, while maintaining control over the development. We have the skills and experience needed to complete the game and we've been working on Farmer`s Life non-stop for the past five months, but we need your help to make it even better!
The initial goal of 15kCA$ will allow us to cover the costs of living for the team and assets that will allow us to finish the game faster, and to hire additional help - graphic artists, animators, level designers and sound technicians - that will assist us in making Farmer`s Life a complete game. All funds over 15kCA$ will go directly into making the game better."

126,1226660346,"The Story
It is that time of year again.  My little sketches frequently visit topics well suited for Halloween!  I had so many to choose from, but the two I settled on really captured my heart.  (If you are curious, here is a link to  last year's Halloween pin design.)
It started with some sketches of witch hats, then the cat started showing up (I named him Magister), then I started wondering whose hat he was playing with and I ended up sketching out a cute little witch girl that I've been calling Vivian.  Out of all of my sketches of them these two were my favorite and I hope you love them too!
I had a friend ask my if it is a tiny witch or a huge cat in the Cat Rider design, and well my best answer is a bit of both are happening in this pin.  Their size and relative scale changes from drawing to drawing to suit the mood I was trying to get.  I am even working on a moody/dramatic digital painting where Vivian is a normal sized/proportioned woman (with a badass spell-sword) and Magister is portrayed as a black panther.  So it's really more about wanting to show them in a cute style for these pins.  
The Pins
Both pins:
Have hard enamel
Have gold colored plating
Have two posts/rubber clutched to prevent spinning
The Cat Rider pins is 1.5 inches wide and 1.5 inches tall.  
The Cat in the Witch Hat pin is 1.5 wide and 1.1 inches tall.
About Frost Dragon Designs, LLC
My name is Joshua R. Pinkas and I am the creator and owner of Frost Dragon Designs, LLC. After years of working on projects for others through freelance work and private commissions, I decided to start building something for myself and started Frost Dragon Designs.  
I am a seasoned pin creator and have designed, had manufactured, and delivered thousands of beautiful enamel pins.  
All of my designs are my own original creations. I start my creative process with traditional drawings in sketchbooks. Even the simplest of designs will usually go through a dozen or more revisions before I recreate it digitally and prepare the files to send to my manufacturers.  
I love launching new projects and designs on Kickstarter because this is where I got my start with my company, and because I have found a wonderfully supportive community here who genuinely care about creatives.  
Every pin you back helps fund the production of new original designs!"

128,2008225117,"What if there was a show that combined Grand Illusions with Irish stories, Celtic Music, Gaelic Myths & Legends, Interactive Comedy, Action, Drama, and a wee bit o' Danger?

If there was, that show would be called ""Celtic Magic."" 

And we need your help to make it a reality.
My name is Daniel GreenWolf and I have been performing professionally for 15 years as a Magician and slightly-Mad Irishman. I have had the honor of working in so many wonderful venues including many Renaissance Faires across the USA, and places like The Big E, The Mark Twain House, and even the United States Coast Guard. 
I was able to learn Magic from some of the best, thanks to living in Connecticut, which is close to amazing magicians in CT, NY, and MA. I've also had the pleasure and life-changing experience of being a 7-year camper of Tannen's Magic Camp and, for the past 9 years, a guest performer & counselor who gets to teach other young Magicians.
WHAT IS CELTIC MAGIC?
In all of this time, I've had one dream in mind: To take the show that I have been performing for a decade to the next level. The problem is, a show of this size is expensive and almost impossible to do alone, especially when you're spending your time performing to make rent and such. So for two years, I've been thinking about and planning and losing sleep over one idea: an illusion show with an Irish Theme.

No one has ever really done it like this, which has always surprised me. The history, art, and music of the Celtic Isles is so beautiful and interesting, that Magic seems like a natural fit. 

What Celtic Magic will be is a Full 90-minute Evening Show that combines Grand Illusions, Escapes, Smaller Stage-sized Magic and Sleight-of-Hand with High energy Irish Music, Celtic Myths & Legends, and sets, costumes, and props designed with an Irish Theme.

There will be audience interaction, comedy, drama, and even some dangerous feats. It's going to be a full theatrical experience. 

But I need money to make it happen. A lot of money. And I know that there are enough people out there interested in something like this that the idea of Kickstarting this show is just crazy enough to work.

And I'm not creating this alone. To get all of these elements to work together, I needed a team just as mad as I am. And aside from my crew of fantabulously talented people, whom I have worked with for years, I've brought in some of the most creative minds in Magic and Theatre to help bring my dream to the stage.

The Celtic Magic Think Tank:
Hiawatha Johnson, Jr.
Magician, Director, Producer, Choreographer, Actor, & Musician Hiawatha Johnson Jr. has been creating Magic and shaping Magicians for decades. He serves as accompanist /composer-in-residence for the Department of Dance at Randolph Macon Woman's College (Lynchburg, VA), he founded the KTMA Performing Arts Ensemble, worked as Chief Consultant for Siegfried & Roy Present Darren Romeo at the Welk Resort Theatre in Branson, Missouri, and has been a teacher and counselor at Tannen's Magic Camp for over 20 years.
David Garrity
Illusionist, Director, and Producer David Garrity has been the performing Magician at Six Flags New England since 1992. Facing the demand of creating a brand new Illusion show every season for decades, David is an international performer who has made Magic in every conceivable type of venue since the early 90s. David performs over 500 shows annually. 
Vinny Giordano
Vinny Giordano has been the secret ingredient in some of the world’s top magic and illusion acts. Transitioning from a young performer to working backstage at magic shows since he was 15. This propelled Vinny into Theme Park, Corporate Event, Off Broadway, Las Vegas Productions and most recent, “The Masters of Illusion - Live World Tour” He is a magic consultant/designer, theatrical prop fabricator and illusion technician.
Scott Hitchcock
Scott Hitchcock is a great entertainer with an utterly unique style. His enormous creative range encompasses magic, dance, music, complicated verse, impersonation and improvisation. Presenting juggling and improvisational comedy on the streets of New York , sleight of hand at private parties and trade shows throughout the Midwest, and magic & illusion in nightclubs in LA, he has received numerous awards and critical acclaim. Not limiting himself to the United States , he has performed for audiences in Europe and Asia on many occasions. Scott has also appeared on NBC, CNN, TNN , USA or E!. He was also featured in the November 2009 issue of “MAGIC Magazine”.
Terri Cook
Magician, Producer, Director, and ""Mamma Magic"" herself, Terri Cook has been an integral part in forming the future of Magic for 30 years. Aside from being a full-time professional performer, Terri is the director of Tannen's Magic Camp, the premiere camp devoted solely to the art of Magic. Terri has also worked with some of the most influential Magicians in modern history, and has become rather influential herself.

Where Is All This Money Going?

These are all estimates... but you get the idea.
 You can see that a majority of the funds are going to fabricate props. Magic illusions are expensive. REALLY expensive. There's going to be some illusionists that will think I'm crazy trying to put a show together for only $40000 and truly, it is the minimum I need. This isn't counting other incidentals like costumes, additional audio, and more. But this Kickstarter is meant to help get the show off the ground. Whatever is raised above and beyond the goal will go right into the show. We promise.
Some Set Design sketches and Prop Concepts 
These are just to give you a flavor of what we're looking to do with the look of the show. (Please note... I'm absolutely not very good a computer-based art... these are rough ideas)

Performed at Zoo Venues in The Monkey House: daily @ 1450 - 1545 7th – 31st Aug
What's the play about?
How long ‘til someone is missing? How long ‘til gone? How long ‘til dead?
A rusty old ute clangs down the highway. Meanwhile a girl sits in a sticky motel room, curtains drawn, counting the turns of the ceiling fan. When Mel’s best friend, Sarah, goes missing at a music festival she wonders if she is the only one really searching...
Inspired by true events, Miss Sarah looks at the debilitating nature of hope, focusing on the unseen victims of missing person cases, those left behind.
A Lynchian nightmare, a psychological thriller, one girl’s search for Sarah.
Who are we?
Why the Edinburgh Fringe?
It is the worlds largest arts festival. Don’t believe us? Over the 25 days of last years Fringe, performers from 51 countries presented 3,193 shows in 299 venues. Selling 2,183,591 tickets. Basically thats a lot of shows and a lot of people and lot of tickets!
It’s also where you will find the biggest collective of producers, theatre owners and other companies looking to buy, tour or invest in emerging talent.
There is even an award that could bring our show back home to perform at the Adelaide Fringe!
Why we need you!
The Edinburgh Fringe Festival is an expensive venture and although we have already secured a performance venue, accommodation, and have all managed to get ourselves into the UK, there are many more costs to consider such as: 
So how do we make up the difference? 
We have been applying for grants and were shortlisted for The Charlie Hartill Theatre Fund sponsored by The Pleasance Theatre Company (so someone must believe in us). We will continue to conduct fundraising campaigns, including your classic jelly bean guessing competition. And then there is this; the Kickstarter campaign where we aim to raise £8000 pounds.
With your donation you are not just investing in one show but in the future of a new company.
What to do next? 
You can donate by following the link on this page or just share this campaign with all your friends. Everything helps us get that little bit closer to our goal!

Hello everyone!  My name is David Lamb, producer/director of this brand new style of show that we would like to bring to you!  I have been a photographer/videographer for over 5 years now, and have been involved in the deaf community for around that long as well.  The more I watch tv/movies with my friends who are deaf, the more I realized that they did not have many choices that related to them on television. Hence, the idea was born to create a show completely in American Sign Language (ASL), and essentially ""flip"" the roles of the hearing person being able to watch a show, while a deaf person has to continually read subtitles.  We have a plan to create a show ran by people living in the deaf community to ensure proper representation of their culture. 
We plan on running the 1st season with a minimum of 6 episodes to stream online.  This is the most exciting project I have ever worked on due to it being BRAND NEW!  ASL is the 3rd most popular foreign language taught in American schools, with around 1,000,000 functionally deaf persons living in the U.S., yet, we do not have a show in ASL for those people who know ASL to enjoy.  Help us make our dream a reality by contributing to this amazing cause!  Thank you for your time and generosity!"

Scottish stencil artist and 2014 Stencil Art Prize finalist Lone Wolf aka Gary Cairns, is producing a number of paintings and mixed media collaborations especially for this Glasgow based gallery exhibition 'exiSTENCILism'.
The exhibition will feature original work by Gary as well as collaborations with photographers Jawn McClenaghan and George Hastings, intending to be the first long term show of its kind in Glasgow city centre. 
The host gallery for the event will be The Virginia Gallery on Virginia Street in the Merchant City area of Glasgow, known for being a hub for creatives and trend setters alike. 
We have started the kickstarter project to help fund the final stages of putting on the show as we have had issues getting sponsors to commit who had previously intimated that they would support our event, mostly process driven or that they have over committed on projects and no real fault of their own. This leaves us with a void to fill financially, to buy things like frames, paint, printing & other costs. 
So, we thought what better way to do this but to offer up some special limited availability services like custom paintings as well as some of the things that will be available to order at the gallery. 
Think of it as a pre-order for a band cd or think of it as being a great source of support to creatives looking to display their skills, provide a 3 week source of entertainment for you all and visitors to our fin city and a great party on opening night (yes their will be food and drinks ;) so don't worry on that score.)
Anyone who pledges will automatically get a full preview of the work featured in the exhibition 7 days before opening night by way of a pdf look book. This will allow you to make your selections of paintings, prints or whatever else you have been kind enough to pledge to. 
I hope you can all get on board and support us, we really want to make this a great experience and not just a bunch of stuff on walls to quickly look at as you pass.
Thanks in advance guys!
One Love.

Learn and Create in Virtual Reality
Stories are what make us human. RealityNext enables students to become producers of their learning experiences—instead of consumers—through the creation of stories. We use role play, narrative, and theater for students to become engaged in world-building and story-making. Unlike any other supplemental education program, our methodology allows for the creation of VR Story-Games for kids by kids in a series of collaborative workshops. 
Parents have legitimate concerns about the online content their kids consume, but we need to recognize that it’s shortsighted to remove teens from technology. Instead, we must meet our kids virtually—inside the computer—and lead them on a path of organic development through active exploration.  
An introduction to project development and group dynamic
Engaging immersive research resources
Narrative-building tools
Recording and replaying through a motion capture interface
Role playing and character exploration
Manipulation of virtual objects
  Help Us Build Our Next Story-Game for Your Home and Your Classroom!  
During our workshops, students:
Watch refresher videos and do research on a single or interdisciplinary subject
Collaborate to solve a series of challenges related to the subject
Choose characters and genre, then storyboard a narrative on the subject
Improvise, rehearse and record a self-designed story-game with the help of Unexpected Productions, using Motion Shadow technology
Present and share their creations with parents and friends and you, our supporters!
Our mission is to transform learning from a passive practice of absorbing facts to learning through active, hands-on participation in making—to update the knowledge delivery system and speak the same language as our kids. If we succeed, the education of the future will provide mixed modes of interdisciplinary experiences that make kids eager to learn and have fun doing it.
   We are Alex and Joel, and with our partners Unexpected Productions and Shadow Motion, we help student make their own virtual reality learning games. Using role play, narrative, and theater, students become engaged in world-building and story-making—coding without coding!   
By supporting our mission, you become a co-producer of original VR story-games made by teens. Your funds make it possible for us to hold our next story-game workshop and move RealityNext's mission forward—to support a new generation of self-learners and courageous explorers inside the virtual worlds of their own making. Contribute at the $250 level and above to receive charter member benefits in our immersive workshop program for teens.  
  We pledge to share the resulting VR story-game adapted for PC and consoles as well as for Oculus, Vive and Windows Mixed Reality users, a chronicle of events, and behind-the-scenes footage with our contributors. Learn more about our projects and initiatives at realitynext.net.

136,1054095031,"Founded in 1927, Yamamoto Noh Theater is the oldest existing Noh theatre in Osaka, designated as a Tangible Cultural Heritage of Japan. We perceive Noh as a classical and yet living performing art - a vessel of universal ethical and aesthetic values from which both actors and audience can learn, irrelevant of their age or cultural identity. We strive to present Noh to the international audience as a Japanese classical art that belongs to the world. We aim to harness Noh's potential to be a bonding material between cultures and generations, by creating and performing a new Noh play, based on a myth that is shared among all Balkan and European countries.
We plan the first performance of the new Noh play ""Orpheus"" to be on the stage of the ancient Roman Amphitheatre in Plovdiv, Bulgaria. By comparing the Japanese and European antiquity we aim to draw ethical parallels, thus facilitating a deeper understanding of both cultures. ""Orpheus"" will depict one of the key figures in Balkan and European cultures through the lens of Japanese tradition, and will focus on the connection between the human soul, love and nature, as well as the conflict between the ambition of personal achievement, one’s true feelings and cultural identity.
The creation and premiere of the new play ""Orpheus"" will involve Bulgarian and Japanese actors, directors and children from local schools. A key priority of our project is expanding the local actors’ abilities with techniques from Noh, as well as the creation of a favourable networking environment for professionals from different nationalities and fields of interest.
Another priority of our project is the difficult task to present Noh to the widest possible range of spectators, regardless of their knowledge of Japanese culture, while maintaining the canon of the ancient performing tradition. We aim not only to entertain, but also to educate the international audience and inspire interest in the classical culture of Japan. Furthermore, the creation and performance of the new Noh play ""Orpheus"" seeks to create a gateway to the culture of Japan, that will remain open long after the realisation of the project. This is the first step in Yamamoto Noh Theater's plan to train local actors and perform the newly created play in a number of European countries sharing a common ancient culture, thus transforming the Japanese tradition into a bonding element for intercultural understanding."
137,737677403,"Project Description
I want to show the beautiful NW region through my eyes with time-lapse photography.   While traditional photographers like to see their work on print, I want to see and share my work on a digital picture frame.  Time-lapse is a dynamic picture that shows movement and constant changes of light.  A print can’t display those movements in nature.  The frame can show time as the storyteller.
Currently on the market, there is no time-lapse displayed on a digital picture frame.  But I have come up with a solution and developed a prototype.  I have already partnered with a manufacturer to make the frames that will fit my needs. I want my work displayed in 1080p resolution. Stores only sell frames with a resolution lower than 1080p.  The manufacturer requires me to purchase 250 frames before they can start production. 
The price goal that I am requesting is too meet minimum purchase of 250 frames, Amazon fees, Kickstarter fees, and licensing fee to include the music.
Price breakdown per frame:
1080p resolution frame $98
shipping to me $2
music license $25
Charity
Pledges have the option of donating a frame to charity. I will document and post the presentation of the frames on my website.
I would like to share my artwork in hospitals. I believe this is the perfect place for the display. Patients can enjoy the beautiful visuals along with a soothing song. I want patients to let their mind escape and enjoy the time-lapse. 
Digital Frame Specifications

The story...
Our studio is part of American Steel Studios in Oakland, a community of artists and artisans working in art and industry. We are excited by the possibility of contributing our glass skills to this diverse community. (For more details check out this great article about the West Oakland Industrial Arts corridor!)
American Steel Studios
Building our own kiln will allow us a.) to work at a larger scale ( 2’x 4’ x 2”)  and b.) create a kiln tailored exactly to our needs. Although we both are actively teaching and creating art neither one of us has our own personal equipment. Having a kiln would enable us to create our personal work, fabricate work for others, and share our love of glass through classes, collaborations, and informal instruction.
Left: Project with Co-op Image Group, Chicago, IL Right: Public art installation, Brooklyn Public Library, Brooklyn, NY
Why support us?
Invest in two teaching artists! We promise we will put your investment to good use. In return you will get great glass art and/or personal instruction and the satisfaction of knowing you helped launch an independent artisan studio!
So, how will we use your money?
Previous kiln built for Chicago Hot Glass, Chicago, IL
The Kiln:
We will be welding the frame and building the interior and exterior of the kiln. Previously Jeremy has built two gas-fired salt glaze kilns, two high-fire electric ceramic kilns, an architectural glass kiln, a molybdenum glass furnace, glass annealers, and repaired a multitude of furnaces and kilns.
We will need:
Refractory:
IFB K20s, insulating firebrick used for the kiln floor
Fiberblanket, an insulating spun ceramic fiber blanket used for the insulation of the sidewalls and top of kiln.
Rigidizer, colloidal silica, used to strengthen fiberblanket and keep fibers from becoming airborn.
IFB Mortar, used to adhere IFBs together
Mullite shelving, used as support for kiln shelf
Kiln shelf stands
Fiberboard, a rigidized refractory board used as large kiln shelf
Ceramic peepholes and plugs
Electronics:
Elements: heating elements for the bottom sides and top of the kiln with all insulative hanging accessories.
Digitry Kiln Controller: a digital controller with user presets, computer connectivity, and possible expansion for the controlling of up to 5 kilns.
Relays:  relays are used to control the on and off of the higher voltage electricity for the kiln’s element with control voltages from the Digitry kiln controller.
Thermocouple: for reading internal kiln temperatures 
Electrical Wire: for control voltages and 480v 
Various electrical components: safety switch, connectors, breaker, bus bar, etc..

139,1876259591,"Nixie XII with the mixed led lighting.
We developed the six digit version of the B7971 at the request of a friend, and thought to make it available to any who want to DIY or have the tubes (these tubes are somewhat scarce, and becoming expensive). This version uses a microcontroller that is only available in small surface mount form, however, in order to make it as accessible as my projects always are, I used a socket for the chip which is easily handled and soldered, being large enough. As always, this makes replacement and repair possible by the novice with moderate skills, since all the other components are the usual standard size, no small surface mount types.
Green phase.
Some features that can be reviewed are the options for wifi/gps connection or manual time set, 12/24 hour clock option, optional colors for the led underlighting, auto/on/off for DST, optional display of date or text message (only with wifi connection) every minute from seconds count 43 to 00. Currently, only wifi or gps connection may be used, not both. All the settings are stored in EEPROM so they will be saved in a power loss. The clock will reboot and re-connect to wifi/gps when power is restored.

The big nixie tubes are in individual pin connector sockets, so they can be removed and replaced very easily. These tubes are somewhat rare now, but can still be found for sale. Unfortunately, I do not have any of the tubes for sale at this time, but the project is for the kit or the assembled clock without the tubes.
The assembled version includes everything needed (except the tubes): the pc board with sockets for the tubes and the homemade plexiglass case, ready to ""plug n play"".
The DIY kit is available in several levels, from all-inclusive (except for the tubes) to the bare minimum of a pc board and a preprogrammed microcontroller.
I have a personal request in with Dalibor Farny, a modern day renaissance man who is currently making new nixie tubes, to ask that he create an alphanumeric version. Perhaps this project might spur his interest in doing so! I think a re-creation of the original B7971 version would be fantastic!

140,1764571496,"UPDATE : We re-designed the printer accordingly to some backers suggestions. You can find below a 360° 3D view of it :D
We've reached 100% of our goal with two weeks left to go! With this achieved we can now make the TRIUM 3D printer real.
Take a look at what can be done if we reach our stretch goals :
From now : 
free additional laser pre-cuts in the aluminum top cover for 2 extra extruder motors. This is nice to have in case of diamond head upgrade. Not mandatory : only for those who want to have it.
free extra tip blower for PLA prints
€56K - 1KG PLA Spool 
for all new backers and already existing backers : 
1kg PLA spool of the color of your choice.
OR
Magnetic Ball Rod Ends upgrade (due to extra development needed, people choosing this upgrade might be delivered later (estimated :+1month) )
All the money of the campaign will be used for developing the printer. If we reach our target (or even more) any exceeding will be put in the TRIUM 3D of our backers without price increase :
multiple head extruder
camera in the printer
extra hotend tip blowers (for even better PLA prints)
and so on 
The more we are, the less the printers cost. (you can find a link to the estimated cost in our FAQ, at the end of this page)
So help us creating the best printer, for the lowest price. 
 All ideas to improve the printer are also welcome. Do not hesitate to speak with/email us :)
Reach the accuracy of the best 3D printers (and the most expensive) available on the market, with a layer thickness which can go down as low as 20 microns (0.02mm). Check out our photos gallery below !

Whereas other companies offer you self printed plastic, wooden or acrylic pieces as part of their 3D printers, we use EU tailor made parts. It requires complex tooling like aluminum extrusion matrices, powerful laser cutter and bending machines to offer you a high quality full aluminum frame.
This specific design allow us to :
Simplify the assembly
Dramatically reduce the number of needed parts (like screws, nuts, washers, sliding rails, connecting parts)
Reduce the final price
Our frame design also allow to fully close the printer, to keep the temperature inside.
As this innovative design requires specific tools for production, we need your help to invest in these tools.
Update : Below is a draft of the re-designed aluminum printer frame (all parts are not in the preview, model size was getting too big)
Our 3D printer includes all a 3D printer requires, no need to choose between tens of options. They are all there :
A 0.5mm nozzle for good compromise between print speed and accuracy. 
ALUMINUM heat bed up to 130°C for better first layer stickiness
ALUMINUM rotational spool holder on top of the printer, matching most existing spool.
Bed auto leveling with inductive sensor to get a perfect level for the first layer and ensure a good print quality
A big circular print area of diameter 220mm * height of 220mm (or ugraded version @440mm height)
A full ALUMINUM frame for stiffness, easy assembly and good looking
A LCD screen and a SD card reader to be computer-free and print directly from the printer (but works as well with computer via usb connection)
Choose between the Kit version, for those who like building/DIY projects and the Plug'n Play version, for those who want to use it right out the box.
 With the 3D printing technology, you can almost do everything :
Repair everyday objects

141,434898193,"Hey all you Bone-Nerds. Enjoyed Gideon & Harrow the Ninth, did you? 
Looking for some cool as heck merchandise to rep your favourite Houses? We got you. 
Let's talk enamel pins. 
Graciously endorsed by Tamsyn Muir, show your pride in the Nine Houses and celebrate Gideon & Harrow the Ninth with these (so spoopy) enamel pins! 
ABOUT THE PROJECT
""Gideon the Ninth is about lesbian necromancers in space. Obviously, it's perfect."" - Vox
The idea to design and make merch for The Locked Tomb series sprang pretty much as soon as Mayticks closed the back cover of Gideon the Ninth. Tamsyn Muir's incredible world-building and loveable characters lead to a solid attachment to the images of the Nine Houses and the people they represent. So - long ago, all the way back in the days before Covid-19 hit Australia (January, 2020), an email was sent to request permission to run a kickstarter. Thanks to Tamsyn Muir's gracious go-ahead, here we are with 10 kick-ass pin designs, and the hopes of making a whole lot more stuff..! Iron-on patches, earrings, and even 3D printed skulls are all on the cards, if we can find sufficient numbers of Adepts and Cavaliers in support! 
1) $5000 - House Pins Group #1 - UNLOCKED!
The first goal of $5000 unlocks the first group of House Pins, which includes:
The First House
The Sixth House
The Seventh House
The Ninth House
The Ninth House (Gideon mod)
Each pin will be approximately 4cm high, made in black base metal with white hard enamel fill, and will feature recessed metal details. The First House pin will also feature glitter enamel!
Production image from my manufacturer.

Look, at the moment the postal situation is pretty crazy-butts. Costs are necessarily high in order to avoid long sea-journeys and excessive loss of items. All pins will be sent with tracking via AusPost. Within Australia, shipping times can be expected to be 3-7 business days. Internationally, please anticipate 4-6 weeks.
TIMELINE
With the designs essentially complete, as soon as the Kickstarter has ended and funds are transferred, production can begin! We expect to be shipping rewards by mid-January, which means that all backers should receive their goods by March. Backers will be kept well-informed of any changes to the timeline!
EDIT 26/9: Due to the fact that this KickStarter has been so wildly popular, this timeline is likely to be pushed back. The sheer amount of merchandise we'll now be dealing with is far beyond anticipated! Please give me an additional month...! I will keep you up to date on any other changes as things arise!"

↟ Funding ↟
Funded at the goal of $600 USD is my Lepus Constellation enamel pin and sticker design. The pin will be shiny gold metal with hard black enamel. The sticker will be a white design with a black background.
Most of the total goal will go towards manufacturing of the pins and stickers. The remaining costs go to shipping, shipping materials, backer cards, and Kickstarter fees.
When the goal amount of $600 is reached and I have the final numbers, the order and artwork will be supplied to manufacturers, and the proofing process begins. It takes approximately 1 month from time of art approval to me having pins in-hand. Once received, all pins will be inspected and put onto backer cards, safely packaged and then mailed.
 ↟ Thank You ↟ 
Thank you for supporting my project. It means so much to me that people love what I can create! Be sure to let your friends know about the Kickstarter!

  Everyone knows that nobody can start at the top. I am asking for help, just so i can start walking my way up. The funding I am asking for would go to pay the apprenticeship fees set before me, a good set of machines, inks, needles, power supply, etc. I have been studying every form of tattoo art that i could find, from countless books, and multiple reputable tattoo artists.
  I have SO much time invested into just learning the absolute basics, that now I am absolutely starving to start preforming the art of tattooing, and giving people a timeless, living, breathing, piece of art.
  There is a tattoo shop nearby that is willing to apprentice me, and he has even lowered the original apprenticeship price by $3,000 (NO apprenticeship is cheap) since I have shown SO much dedication to the arts. I have found a tremendous emotional support system through all of my adventures since i started taking steps to be a tattoo artist, and I KNOW that I can make something of myself if I can just get a good start. If i were able to raise the funding from the loving people that visit this site, I would have NO way of putting my absolute gratitude into words for helping a man reach his dreams, and fulfill a life of happiness. THANK YOU all for caring, and reading what I have to say.
May you all find love, and blessings in your day to day lives here are a few of my artworks. I hope you enjoy looking at them as much as i did making them =]

--- Original Start ---
When reading our name did you think just another copy of something famous? Hold on, yes we might have not been very creative with our name, but believe it, we are very creative with our hard and software. We just did not spend much more time with the name to have more time for development.
Were do we come from ...
Originating from different areas in the semiconductor industry we meet by chance the Arduino Uno and quickly recognized it is a great tool for a lot of projects. One thing we recognized in our work is: We frequently needed for newer sensors not 5V I/O but 3.3V and therefor a level shifter. Also SRAM is a bit tight when you want to store lots of sensor data. So we decided to make our own version to add this features. Of course the easy approach could have been to run simply from 3.3V but that would have been not perfect either, as there are also other sensors e. g. like a lot of gas sensors requiring 5V and in addition we would have lost speed. We call this board Uno335 to point to the levelshifters.
As we were working (and hearing of the cool ESP8266 with Lua firmware), we thought why always use a Raspberry for the Internet gateway lets plan a WiFi shield to cover not very complex stuff. No sooner said than done Niko our PCB designer started  the first prototype.This board will be called Uno8266 as it is a shield with Uno footprint and a 8266 wifi module.
After having two boards we thought further and liked the idea to add a sensor board UnoEVS for environmental monitoring containing of temperature, humidity, pressure, various gases and a (optional) CO2 sensor. The gas sensors and especially the CO2 sensor will be optional as a good CO2 sensor is more expensive than all the rest of the boards we want to make.
Now we covered computing, connectivity and sensing so what is missing? Yes you are right! A actuator! We started to work on UnoSWU a SWitchable power plug with an Usb power supply. The great thing is that UnoSWU switches by providing a small voltage 3-30Vdc so you can use the the USB supply to power Uno335/Uno8266/UnoEVS and use a digital output to switch UnoSWU. Guess you got the idea ...
To us (and hopefully you as well) that will be helpful so we stood up funded a company and prepared this Kickstarter project. Again, given our mostly technical focus the names are not very creative, or do you think different? But now joking apart, lets look on the great specs. 
The Specs
The technical details
Uno335
The Uno335 is built based on an Arduino Uno R3 and inherits all the basic features that you love, including the completely same formfactor. Indeed you can use your Uno335 exactly as the original Arduino Uno by setting jumpers, but this is not the mode we have made the Uno335 for.
Given the point above the Uno335 is programmed using the Arduino IDE. Download here.
We added 512kbit serial SRAM to increase storage capacity. This memory will connect to the microcontroller using the SPI interface. A library will be provided to access the serial SRAM.
I2C at 3.3V as many newer sensors just work based on 3.3V I/O we added the classical NXP circuit for levelshifting I2C at Pins SCL, SCA close to AREF. On A4, A5 still the regular 5V I2C interface is available, means you can use I2C parts at both voltage levels. Setting jumpers you can switch of the levelshifting.
SPI at 3.3V we added a TI TXB0104 bidirectional levelshifter to the digital pins 10, 11, 12, 13 enabling the SPI interface at 3.3V. As the onboard serial SRAM is running on 3.3V as well, it uses the same levelshifter. To keep digital pin 10 (slave select) for external use we have a voltage divider on pin XXX that can act as slave select for the internal serial SRAM. Also these features can be enabled/disabled using jumpers.
Uno8266 
 ESP8266-12 module wih PCB antenna
Arduino Uno shield formfactor
Programmable either using NodeMcu firmware or through the pluging for Arduino IDE.
Can be programmed wirelessly
SD card socket.
Board is designed  for dual use either as shield on top of a Uno335 or standalone powered by the ESP8266 MCU programmed in Lua. We will see if it works on top of Arduino standard pinout as well.
Voltage converter to 3.3V LM3671 (buck converter 1A output)
74LVC1T45 (Levelshifter for RxTx Uno335) Interface: UART
UnoEVS 
ATmega328 running at 3.3V programable using the Arduino IDE
BME280 (pressure, temp, humidity) connected with I2C
LTR303ALS01 (ambient light sensor) connected with I2C
ML8511 (UV light sensor) analog out connect to ATmega328 ADC
TSSP58038 für IR remote control (IR Receiver)
VSMB10940 für IR remote control (IR Sender)
Supply voltage 5V from Arduino Uno335 V
voltage converter to 3.3V mit LP2985
4 connectors (2x I2C, 1x analog, 1x digital) to Seeedstudio Grove, this way you can add more than 100 additional sensors and other useful things.
CO2 (NDIR near infraread absorption based)  sensor optional
We consider the CO2 sensor very important as this gas has no color and does not smell and even at only slightly higher concentrations (>600ppm compared to the typical 350-450ppm) you start to feel not perfect anymore. To tak action you first need to kown the CO2 level and here the EE893 sensor can be mounted on the prepared  UnoEVS comes in.
Key features
E+E dual wavelength NDIR CO2 working principle
Measuring range up to 10,000ppm
Auto-calibration for excellent long term stability
Temperature compensation
Highly insensitive to pollution
Very low current consumption down to 60 μA
Digital output
Very small size
Comes from Austria.
You can find more info here.The only reason why we have made it optional is, is it very expensive compared to the reast of the UnoEVS (roughly about 3 times the price of a UnoEVS). You can think of intersting projects combining especially the UnoSWU to do something against high CO2 level (e. g. turn fresh air supply on).
UnoSWU 
Connector system: safety plug (CEE 714) or rubber connector plug
The current switching status is indicated by a green LED Load and control circuit have a safe electrical isolation over an Optotriac
Protection: IP20, only for dry rooms #
Load Switches = relay: very robust against possible voltage stress peaks and problematic 230V consumers (with highly inductive or capacitive load shares, high inrush currents, etc.)
Load circuit
Operating voltage: 230V ~, 50Hz (optional 115V ~, 50Hz)
Maximum switching capacity: resistive loads like light bulbs or heaters: 2000W (8.7A) inductive loads such as motors, transformers, etc.: 2000VA (8.7A)
Control circuit
Control voltage: 3VDC ... 30VDC
Control current: 3mA ... 9mA
USB Power Supply
Femal USB Type A connector
500mA @ 5V minimal target
Working with system voltage is not our core competency so we are partnerning with an engineering company in Germany to develop UnoSWU, below you see a picture of a similar product they already made.
power plug (not ours)
Some things you can make 
In the following we show you a few things you can make, but for sure we are sure you will have better ideas and we would love to add your greates proposals here too, so please tell us:
Use Uno335 to interface with sensors just speaking 3.3V like BMP180 or BME280
Use the onboard SRAM of Uno335 to stor measurment data until wifi (Uno8266) becomes available again.
Use UnoXXX to control moisture level for our plants Uno335 calculate when to water, UnoEVS sense humidity, moisture level (through a attached Grove System sensor), UV intensity and ambient light. Uno8266 sends data to the cloud (Thingsspeak etc.) and finally UnoSWU can control pumps, humidity or/and a roller shutter
we want to add you suggestions ...
Use UnoSWU for PWM type control of high voltage tools
The following picture shows the ingredients of UnoSWU (switchable plug plus USB powersupply) in action to control a ventilator
The duty cycle of the ventilator was low earlier (26°C) and is now much higher (almost 30°C - today it is hot in Bavaria).
In the following you see two videos and you can see and hear (as the relay switches) the increase duty cycle.
PLAY

Where we are now (and what is still todo)
What we have done so far
We have designed the Uno335, manufactured prototypes and tested these thoroughly.
We have finished the designs for the other boards and sent them for prototype manufacturing.
We built lots of test circuits on bread and breakout boards to start software development to see the hardware in action and polish the design. Most of the software we will later publish on our website.
The partner for making the UnoSWU has made similar products and is very confident that the specs are easily doable.
All major functionalities are proven.
What we still need to do
The Uno335 is fixed from feature point of view, here we are just continue to test and fix problems for the preproduction design.
For the other three boards prototypes are on the way, but features are not totally froozen (see the specs section). Here we need to freeze the features soon (YOUR COMMENTS ARE VERY WELCOME) to order the final prototypes
Continue testing to makeeverything massproduction ready.

146,1329000338,"Hi! I'm Rosie. Most people who know me, know that I love talking about mental health. Working with mental health, I feel like I've picked up some neat lessons, and my favourite one is that self-care is incredibly important. The things that we deny ourselves, like time off, a good cry, a break, or the help that we need, can really mess things up.
These pins are cute reminders. Little mascots to remind you - it's okay to be sad! You deserve the help! And you're already good enough, so take a break. 
Pin no. 1
The first pin in the series is a cute pup - ""You're Already Good Enough"" - possibly my favourite message of the three. If we reach our minimum goal of £250, this pup will go to manufacture and be made.
Stretch Goals
Stretch Goal no. 1
This fluffy kitten will be made when we reach our first stretch goal of £500. ""You Deserve the Help You Need"" - I can't tell you how many people have insisted that other people deserve help and care more than them. This kitten knows better.
Stretch Goal no. 2
Because self care isn't all fun - sometimes it's letting yourself be sad. This pin will be made if we reach stretch goal no. 2 - £700."
147,923681546,"The Project
In our ever-changing world, habitats are relentlessly disturbed and fragmented by humans. These habitat changes have major consequences for native species. In some cases, these changes can lead to the origin of biodiversity (speciation), but they can also lead to the collapse of species boundaries and, ultimately, to a loss of biodiversity. My graduate thesis work at the University of Denver addresses these critical questions using a small freshwater fish, the threespine stickleback.
Male threespine sticklebacks typically display a flashy, bright red throat area to attract females. However, in locations along the Pacific coast of North America, males from several rivers have lost this iconic mating signal and instead display a solid black body coloration during the breeding season.
I am investigating whether these two color types mate (Are they different species?) and the potential mechanisms that keep these two color types apart (How are there two color types maintained in the same streams?).
I suspect that changes in land use have altered water color in some Washington streams, causing a shift from red to black. For example, male sticklebacks with black coloration are more visible in tannin-rich water. Color is often involved in animal mate choice and helps females to decide which male(s) they will accept as mates. This means that environmental disturbances - especially human induced disturbances - could be problematic for threespine sticklebacks and other organisms that rely on color signals for reproduction. These changes can cause a species to split into two or destroy boundaries between them. Other common disturbances to freshwater habitats (like habitat degradation and climate change) might also affect the exchange of individuals between populations, directly impacting the genetic differences between them.
Human activity is the leading cause of global species extinction and endangerment. It is crucial to study these populations to better understand how human behavior affects biodiversity. My research will further our understanding of the barriers that maintain biodiversity and contribute to conservation efforts by revealing how human-induced threats impact reproductive interactions and boundaries. 
How You Can Help
My pilot trip to the Pacific Northwest proved that my paddleboarding approach is very effective for stickleback collection and helped me establish the methods I need to return to locations in Washington and Oregon that are crucial to my work. Forget white lab coats and fancy hotel rooms! We experience the wild side of science by trekking riverbanks in waders, paddleboarding through creeks, measuring fish on a fallen tree, and camping every night. Your support will help me pay for campsites, paddle board rentals, and a rental car to transport our fish in addition to contributing to my genetic analysis, behavioral measurements, and environmental work. 
I cannot thank you enough for your help! This would not be possible without you. You can visit my website for additional information about me and my research, to follow my progress, or to contact me if you have any questions!"
148,1230612832," So Crystal and I have done it.
We've developed a lovely plan for this chapter of our lives. As you all may or may not know. Crystal and I are both minimalists & naturalists. I'm a professional musician who has been offered recording contracts in the past, but really didn't want to be trapped in the city or so far from my family. So we've decided to start vlogging our progress on a wonderful idea that would allow us to be free to travel, bring communities together and introduce them to local farmers, which would help bridge the gap.
We would buy our flatnose school bus 🚌, convert it into a tiny home on wheels using as much re-purposed and free material as possible. Then we reach out and coordinate with communities for a farm to table pop up dinner (food provided by local farmers) accompanied by a mobile house concert (music provided by yours truly). This idea brings communities and farmers together while providing entertainment. We will be vlogging all of this, so stay in touch and like FrenchShip Bus for future posts on the matter!
  With that said. We know that this bus will take many steps to completion and potentially be costly, even though we intend on using free, re-purposed and donated items for the conversion. We know that this project will be just that. A project. We need your help, but we are not solely relying on donations, as we are also funding this endeavor with our good old fashioned paychecks. We will begin Vlogging on YouTube very soon and keep everyone up to date with purchases and building progress. We are going to continue to fine tune the details, but are really looking forward to seeing this become a reality! Frenchship is something we all need! ♥
  First we buy the bus as is, which will be in between $3000-$8000, then we start the conversion process! (Which will be a blast to watch on YouTube)
We predict it will take a year to convert and by 2020 we will be hosting these Frenchship Pop-up Dinner/Mobile House Concerts.
  We will be making a plack for the back of the bus honoring those who donated. The plack will have you name and a small message of love you'd like for those to see.
Add your name with a $500 donation! We can't wait to see this change peoples lives.  Join us on our journey!

Zak Stevens, formerly of Savatage, started Circle II Circle in 2002. ""ZAK IS BACK ON THE ATTACK!"" CIIC has been running wild all over the globe since the release of their latest album ""Seasons Will Fall"" in January 2013.  This album is considered to be one of their strongest from both a musical and production standpoint.  That is until CIIC releases their next album which is tentatively scheduled for a spring 2015 release!
This documentary ""Dreams That Never Die"" will be following CIIC from recording their new album in the studio to the road on their world tour. During this journey we will be looking back, covering the stories from the Savatage years to our current/upcoming 2015 world tour. We will take you behind the scenes from the studio to the stage, from our hotels to our living rooms to capture the realities of a touring band in the music industry today.  Dreams that Never Die will capture the raw emotion, triumph, victory, pitfalls, and struggles of one of the hardest working bands across the globe, andwhat it takes to get our music out to you, the fans.
Update #2 100% funded! But this is not the end, Zak talks about our new goal for US Tour support
Update #2 Message from Zak
Update #1 US Tour
Being on the road is a great opportunity for interviews that we otherwise wouldn't be able to film. The funding will support bringing the film crew on tour with us and also send them to additional locations when opportunities arise. This is not just another tour footage documentary. We want to to tell you the stories directly from the storytellers themselves. We need to be able to provide flights and hotels so we can send our team out to gather these stories. Without your support we can not collect these stories and bring them to you.

Why $10,000?
This covers the bare minimum of the cost to have a dedicated crew to travel with the band through the up coming tours in Europe, Brazil, Dubai, and possible North American shows. We need to be able to provide airfare, hotels and to feed them on the road. 100% of the funding is going directly to the cost of filming. We need the ability to jump on opportunities and travel to the people you want to hear from. With this funding we have dedicated crew that will be working on this 24/7.
Our goal covers the bulk of the expenses. Other expenses, such as gear, time and effort, sweat, blood, and tears are being absorbed by the film maker and CIIC. As well as the huge effort to edit this into a documentary once the footage is complied. All of which is being absorbed by the film maker.
We can do this with our funding goal, because of the help we receive from our family, loved ones and friends who believe in what we are trying to do. No one is drawing a salary or profit from this campaign. This is why we can bring you the documentary ""Dreams That Never Die"" ... 'cause they don't! 
Successful Funding
Successful funding is not the end of the story! If we go beyond our goal, this means we can talk to you about greater ideas we have in mind for this project and for you fans in North America!
Fulfillment Schedule
DVD, Download Link, Memory Stick - ""Dreams That Never Die"" is scheduled for a 2015 release and will include interviews and tour footage.

             In the wake of COVID-19, the performing arts have been hard to access in a time where people need art. I am working on a project designed for eleven dancers that will outline the course of the pandemic through movement. I will be looking for dancers varying in gender from different cultural backgrounds. Most entertainers have been unemployed throughout this entire pandemic. It is my goal to give them meaningful work and pay them a fair wage, getting dancers back to their careers again.
         The piece will be forty minutes in length with an original score composed by Simon Greenberg. It will include athletic dancing, props, projection, and lighting design. I intend to use a plethora of saran wrap that will manipulate, support, trap and encase the dancers' bodies. The project will abide by the regulations put in place by the CDC. This will include social distancing, individuals only making contact if they are in the same pod, masks being worn, and taking a mandatory COVID-19 test before the project ensues. I am not only passionate about bringing performance opportunities back into our society, but bringing them back safely.
             I will film this work upon its completion, and plan to put it on a streaming service where the public can watch it for free. My mission is to make the arts accessible and to reach a wide variety of people. The projected dates for production rehearsals and filming are November 29th, 2020, through December 12th, 2020. 
        As my company is newly formed, I will need some additional funding to make this project possible. The money will be used to pay for rehearsal space, and pay the dancers, sound designer, and videographer for their work. I believe that this project will leave a lasting impression on viewers from all over and will be a powerful beginning to DMD's future. The arts are needed now more than ever, and I plan to bring this experience to your own living room. Thank you for taking the time to look this project over. Your time and your support are very appreciated and will not go unnoticed.

A Stabber-Comedy
When five members of DIK (Delta Ironic Kappa) go to Chad’s lakehouse for a weekend getaway, toxic masculinity isn’t the only thing lurking in the shadows, as the legendary Hyde and Seek Killer emerges and hunts down the boys one by one.

We are raising money to submit this short film to film festivals across the nation including South by West Film Festival, Tribeca Film Festival and many others. Our goal is to raise money to cover the film festival entry fees. The funds will also cover the cost of the composer for the film and miscellaneous post production costs. 

This past summer in the Fool's Pajamas Productions office we had an intern, Tyler Parrish, who came to us with this very ambitious idea called ""Frat Splat"". Our schedule was much less busy due to the coronavirus pandemic, so we took this opportunity to create this slasher comedy written and directed by Tyler. As we assembled our cast and crew, we knew this project was going to be something special. We worked long nights and even kept shooting through the night on a tight schedule.

We want to give a special thanks to our amazing cast and crew for all the hard work they have and continue to put into this passion project. We are creating this kickstarter project because we believe that this short film has the potential to be everything we want it to be. "
156,151500671,"The Beauty Clause is a book project and social media initiative dedicated to discovering, understanding, and celebrating authentic beauty in cultures around the world.
The Beauty Clause as seen on The Huffington Post
Our plan is to travel the world, seeking out women in each of the countries we visit who can help us better understand the standards of beauty unique to each of their cultures. We will be compiling their stories along with photographs of our travels into a coffee-table style book.
 Here's a glimpse of a few of our advocates here in the U.S. and the stories they've shared:
Our hope is that by bringing awareness and understanding to the different standards of beauty in cultures around the world our readers will be able to more easily recognize beauty in other people, as well as in themselves. By sharing these stories and photographs, we hope to build a community of compassionate individuals focused on promoting empathy amidst diversity and comradery upon similarities.
What people are saying about The Beauty Clause:
The Beauty Clause is dedicated to bridging the gap between cultures and people around the world. The ability to recognize and celebrate beauty in the unfamiliar is not only critical to the advancement of the human spirit, but imperative in stopping the personal detriment caused by being outcast by the world around you.
Q: What about men?
A: We absolutely, 100% believe that everyone is beautiful and is worthy of feeling included in and noticed by a world that can all-too-often be quick to judge and quick to outcast people who are different than them or different than what they know. With that, for our first book, we plan to focus on women. Being completely inclusive is something that we discussed, and is and will forever be important to us, but we strongly believe that different groups of people are weighted by issues and standards that are specific to their group. The arguments about beauty that surround men are oftentimes very different than those that women face on a daily basis and so we decided to choose one target demographic for this project and the first book. With that, we are dedicated to being as inclusive as possible within this demographic. As our project and efforts gain momentum, we hope to have the ability to give full focus to both women and men.

I've spent the past few months working on this new body of work that deals with the topic of the unknown. It is a meditation on living with the unknown as a constant companion. On the liberating but often times paralyzing and reality-altering feelings of what it means to wander along a vague path with no set destination. Staged photographs are set up against alienated snapshots and together create a visual poem that talks about a topic that's familiar to anyone.

About Esthaem
Self Portrait with Odin, 2016
Esthaem (b. 1992) is a photographic artist based in Linz, Austria. He holds a BA in Graphic-Design and Photography from the University of Art and Design Linz and is currently studying Visual Communication.
Drawn to nature, life itself and the human body, he uses the latter and treats it as a sculptural object, allowing him to explore topics such as identity, intimacy, (de-)construction of sexuality, gender as well as the self through his photographic work.
He wanders along the narrow path of theory and its discourses, photography as art and his personal point of view, all while maintaining a distinct photographic vision which is often being referred to as „visual poetry“.
His images are a mirror of his own constructed reality, portraits of difficult to grasp subject matters that aim to translate his analysis of the world into aesthetically pleasing imagery full of fragile moments, sensuality and symbolism.

The website of Charlie Hebdo went offline shortly after the shooting, and when it returned it bore the legend Je suis Charlie on a black background. The statement was used as the hashtag #jesuischarlie and #iamcharlie on Twitter."
161,1872928681,"In June 2015, the first-ever crowdfunded forensic investigation of a state pension—the $8 billion Rhode Island system—was successfully completed and the report Double Trouble: Wall Street Secrecy Conceals Preventable Pension Losses in Rhode Island delivered to the public via multiple media sources. The investigation revealed that investment decisions that were obviously wrong from inception—reckless piloting of public retirement assets into secretive high-risk investments and leakage related to lavishing ever-greater investment fees on Wall Street—were the greatest factors undermining the solvency of the state pension. Mismanagement and “politicization” of pension investments were the chief culprits. Due to potential violations of the federal securities laws identified during the investigation, the report was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"").
Now the nation’s leading pension investigator—former SEC attorney and Forbes contributor Edward Siedle—will conduct a forensic investigation of the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS), America’s largest public pension plan with over $300 billion in assets. Over the course of his career Siedle has conducted $1 trillion-plus in forensic investigations. He was recently named as one of the 40 most influential people in the U.S. pension debate by Institutional Investor for 2014.
This project will culminate in the release of an extensive forensic investigative report prepared by Siedle for publication via across media. In the event any actual or potential violations of the federal securities laws are identified, the report may be filed with the SEC.  
With 1.72 million members relying upon CalPERS for retirement benefits and a funded status of only 69.8 percent, prudent management of the state pension's investments is of grave concern to all stakeholders—including California's 11 million taxpayers. Given its huge size, CalPERS is closely watched by other public pensions in the United States and investors globally often follow its lead. Poor investment decisions at CalPERS can, and frequently do, result in harm to investors far outside the state of California.
CalPERS’ investments have been controversy-ridden since the early 2000s, including a “pay to play” scandal that implicated the CEO and some board members. In 2011, the fund paid $11 million to a Washington, D.C., law firm and its advisors to conduct an internal review which found support for allegations of corruption, bribery and influence peddling. CalPERS defended the substantial fees paid to the law firm, noting that it used the findings to negotiate $215 million in fee reductions from private equity managers. In September, 2014, the CalPERS announced it would shed its entire $4 billion investment in hedge funds as part of an effort to simplify its assets and reduce costs. While CalPERS stated that the decision wasn't based on the performance of the program, the hedge funds earned 7.1 percent during a fiscal year when all of the fund returned 18.4 percent. The annualized rate of return on its hedge fund investments over the last 10 years was 4.8 percent.
Recently CalPERS unveiled a plan to slash the numbers of outside money managers it uses, arguing that their performance couldn't justify the expenditure.  
In short, corruption, bribery, influence-peddling, excessive fees, lack of transparency and underperforming high-risk alternative investments have plagued America's largest public pension for at least the past decade. It's time the CalPERS Board and stakeholders got a much-needed expert ""second opinion."" 
Our mission is to provide CalPERS stakeholders with an independent, expert review which can be used to improve the structure, investments and performance of the plan.  
Today CalPERS stakeholders pay the cost of the experts it hires for advice regarding retirement plan matters, yet lack access to experts of their own choosing to review the decisions that are made. Without the information and specialized knowledge required to evaluate the retirement plan, stakeholders lack an effective voice in plan matters. A retirement planning paradigm which specifically excludes the very individuals whose money is at risk makes no sense. 
While few stakeholders can afford to hire a nationally-recognized investment expert on their own, through crowd-funding using our proprietary forensic protocol, participant or stakeholder dollars can be combined to fund a high-impact independent review at a far lower cost than even an employer would pay. We know it can be done because over the past 30 years we've reviewed over $1 trillion in assets.. Of course, you don’t have to be a worker or participant to contribute to this investigation. The identities of the crowdfunding donors are confidential.

162,943100773,"Most people are unaware that there are currently 15,000 Americans in need of a bone marrow transplant, while only 2% of eligible Americans are registered donors.  To become a potential donor, all it takes is a simple swab of your cheek and you could give someone a second chance at life.  
While filming the recovery of my good friend and mentor, Joselyn Miller, a bone marrow recipient, I became increasingly intrigued with the need to increase potential donors and I myself joined the Be The Match registry.  Due to Joselyn's appreciation of her second chance at life, a friendly competition developed between Joselyn, her husband Todd, and I, to cross off items on our respective bucketlists. One item on my bucket list was to walk across America. During the walk, I will be documenting encounters with bone marrow recipients, donors, family members of recipients, doctors as well as the people I meet in towns along the cross country adventure.
The film will feature my personal challenge of walking 3,200 miles from Atlantic City, New Jersey, to San Francisco, California, and the experiences that unravel along the way.  I have been trained to personally swab and register potential donors, which you will see in the film.  My goal is to increase the number of registered donors by 600 by the end of my cross-country walk.  
Your donation will be split 50/50 to help me pay for the food, water and the occasional housing that I’ll need to complete the 7 month walk from coast to coast; the other half going toward the cost of post production of the documentary, which will include editing, music rights, animation, the production of DVD's and more. I have assumed responsibility for all upfront costs of equipment for the trek such as a tent, push cart, sleeping bag, proper clothing etc.  I have also assumed responsibility for the cost of all film, lighting, and sound equipment for the film.
I hope you will still consider contributing to my project even if the funding goal has been met.  All additional funds will help to enhance the quality of the film and expand awareness about the need for bone marrow donors and the ease with which one can become a potential donor.  "
163,1771063270,"You are reading this and I would like to thank you for doing so. This Kickstarter campaign is a fundraiser/pre-sale for my second CD Summer Sands & Sleeping Bears. It has been five years since the release of my first CD and I have been busy writing and recording original instrumental finger-style tunes. Yes, it takes me a bit longer because the music thing is a spare-time gig.  I am an educator by profession having taught in Northern Michigan for the past twenty years at the high school and college levels. When time allows I play guitar and write music because I can’t imagine not doing so. It is a release, a necessity (akin to breathing) and a joy to create music. 
As a non-touring musician the expense of producing a CD is a bit daunting. I managed to keep my head above water on the last CD with the support of all the people who were kind enough to purchase Borderline Normal and by placing a few tunes on the PBS Program RoadTrip Nation and satellite music providers in the US and Canada.  Summer Sands & Sleeping Bears is another homegrown project. 
 I keep the costs down by doing much of the recording in various rooms of our home. With this KickStarter campaign I am hoping to raise enough funds to cover production costs and the initial pressing of the CD. If we surpass the initial goal (be still my heart) funds will go towards a third CD and to compensate those who have contributed skill, time and help along the way.
 Summer Sands & Sleeping Bears is in the process of being mastered and should be ready for release in June. Sound Engineer and guitarist Steve Reinthal is hard at work mastering the CD in Brisbane Australia. Steve teaches Sound Design for film and TV at Griffith University, one of Australia's most innovative tertiary institutions. He is also an enormously talented and innovative guitarist. Steve was kind enough to add some fret work to ""A Loon's Lament"" on the CD.
Summer Sands and Sleeping Bears also features the musical talents of three other very special musicians:
Leslie Anne Harrison  the expressive flautist from the band New Time Ensemble and the folk duo Folk Ragoût.
Tim Lorsch, accomplished session and and recording artist, plays fiddle and octave violin
The incomparable multi-instrumentalist Zac Leger contributes whistle to a couple of tunes.
Several of the tunes on this CD were inspired by travel to places as far away as the United Kingdom  and Hawaii as well as places close to my Michigan home in Northwestern Lower Michigan where my wife and spend much of our summers beaching and cycling. One of the title tracks refers specifically to the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore and both Leland Harbor and the Schooner Inland Seas(thanks to Tom Kramer and WIAA) make an auditory appearances in the tune “Foamfollower.”

Another Northwestern Lower Michigan connection is the artwork of acclaimed local artist Glenn Wolff. Glenn created an original pen & ink and watercolor drawing entitled Summer Sands & Sleeping Bears for the cover of this CD. His unmistakable artistry is instantly recognizable in this work.
I have put together some packages to kick the pre-sale of the CD into gear.  I hope you will find one that will encourage you to get on board and contribute. A big incentive is the chance to get an original and exclusive limited edition giclée print of the cover art for Summer Sands & Sleeping Bears by celebrated and critically acclaimed Northern Michigan artist Glenn Wolff.  
There is also the chance for one lucky person to claim the original pen & ink and watercolor drawing “Summer Sands & Sleeping Bears” matted and framed from Glenn Wolff himself...very cool!!!
There you have it. My primary goal is to raise $1,000 through this campaign and have the CD in your hands by the end of June. If we can go beyond that goal,  funds raised will go towards a fancier packaging for the CD and towards the recording of the next CD. All those who contribute to this campaign at the ""Sand Between the Toes"" Package level and above will have their name included in the next CD project.
Please know that your support for this project and the first CD are greatly appreciated.
With wishes for glad tidings, cheer and plenty of summer sands,

166,1951782425,"Working on the devotional
Hi. I'm Jaden. I'm almost 12. I've been on Christmas break from school and have been reading the Bible every morning. Two mornings in a row I felt like I needed to write a book for kids my age and told my mom. She prayed with me and helped me get started. 
As I was working on devotionals, I asked my mom if I could do more than just one book. She told me that if God called me to it, she would help me do it. I'm almost done with the first devotional that has 30 days of verses from Proverbs with stories, questions, and prayers for kids to walk through and learn how to apply what the Bible says to their life. 
I want to give this book to all the kids in my youth group at church. There are about 35 people. My mom figured out the cost to order those books, which is about $150. That's what I need help with from you. My Aunt Denise and one of my mom's friends already helped by sending some money, so all I need now is $110. 
This is from the back cover of the book:
I Love God: A Devotional for Tweens and Teens is written by Jaden Laster, a tween following God's call in his life. The stories and lessons have contributions from Simon Gabriel, Jaden's younger brother and companion in all the things!
The Bible is the mainstay for knowledge, but understanding real world application is tough. This devotional helps bridge the gap between God's word and the world. Many adults in Jaden's life have helped him through guiding conversations that provide a deeper connection with God and a desire to lead his life by faith. After a series of mornings spent reading in Proverbs, Jaden felt called to share his experiences in this must-have devotional for all kids living in an age of anger, greed, and distraction.
I posted this on my mom's Facebook and her friends said I should really do a Kickstarter campaign.
Hi. My Mom is letting me write this message. 
I want to do something this year for all the kids my age. I need some help from you. I'm writing a devotional series based on what I see happening in the world. I want to give it away to all the kids in my youth group. There are about 35 people in that group. That's around $150. Will you help me cover the cost?
My Mom says I should also think bigger than just my youth group, so if you have kids that are between 10 and 14, they might want one too. Can I send them a copy?
Here's an example of what I have so far.
""Come and listen to my counsel. I'll share my heart with you and make you wise."" Proverbs 1:23, NLT
I had a friend that wanted to throw knives at the snow. I had a bad feeling inside of me that told me ""No! Do not do this!"" The feeling inside of me was like a stomach pain. I was sort of queasy. I told my friend I didn't want to do it and he did it anyway. I didn't want anyone to get hurt so I ran home. He hasn't wanted to be my friend since, but I pray for him anyway.
Read Proverbs 1:20-23
Have you ever had this uneasy feeling?
Did you listen to it or not?
Do you think that feeling is the Holy Spirit?
God, please help me follow the Holy Spirit so I can make good choices. Amen.
My first devotional will have 30 devotions and space for kids to write their answers. My mom says that if anyone wants to help me, to send her a message and she will give you information on how. I'll have this finished next week and the first books will be ready for delivery at the end of the month.
Thank you. Jaden"
167,1190486323,"Hello space-farers and desert dwellers! 
This is my first Kickstarter project and I'm excited to share some Dune-inspired art with you.  Dune is one of my favorite book series of all time, and even though years can go by without rereading it, I still feel the concepts and imagery flowing through my mind.  ""Riders on the Worm"" was a joke shared by the first roommates I ever had after moving out west, but the first sticker I made based on it wasn't very satisfying.  Time to make new art and a better print job! 
Sticker design!
There were quite a few  sketches before getting the design exactly as I pictured it in my mind.  I usually work with ink, but I wanted the lines to be especially clean, so I used Procreate on the iPad.  I didn't use Illustrator because I wanted it to maintain a slightly more organic look.
The goal of this campaign is to fund the printing of high-quality stickers that are both UV resistant and waterproof.  Each sticker will be 4"" x 4"" - large enough to enjoy the smaller details in the artwork, printed on waterproof and UV-resistant 4mm vinyl.
The minimum amount I would like to print is 500 stickers - that's where the best price break is.
Here's a breakdown of the costs -  
 Printing  -  $220
 Taxes & Fees - $105
 Shipping - $60
 Other things like possibly buying new shipping materials, extra stickers in case some get lost in the mail, etc. - $10
 Total - $395

 Launch in mid-May 2020
 Campaign ends in late-June 2020
 Order stickers in late-June 2020

This year, I told myself I would go beyond borders, into the unknown of the wild places I have yet to discover. I had a lot of countries on my mind for my next big adventure but after watching ""The Ivory Game"" on Netflix I quickly turned my eyes to an issue that totally shattered my heart, poaching. 
Elephants are constantly killed : 96 a day, 672 a week, 2,688 a month, and 32,256 a year.
We estimate the global population to be around 300.000 elephants today, compared to an average of 4-5 Million in the 30's - 40's There's only an estimated 30.000 individuals in Kenya, intensively tracked and brutally murdered for as few as 3 dollars US.. If things don't change we might only be able to see an elephant in a history book.
Orphans elephants at the David Sheldrick Trust for Wildlife in Nairobi, Kenya captured by Michael Nichols
 I am currently pitching a huge trip in Kenya that involves anti-poaching campaigns, learning about wilderness conservation on location as well as meeting the people involved in this fight against wildlife terrorism, taking part in the de-snaring walk , and most of all, I'll try my hardest to capture the most beautiful and wildest scenes Kenya has to offer, I'll be making portraits of local tribes and villagers and learn more about the people living there, the animals and how we can all help to protect them. I will document all the wildlife efforts and not only touching elephants!
This isn't a small project and this will require a lot of professional gear and a cinematic camera to make a short film about this adventure to transpire as clearly as possible how I've seen this country and the experiences I had. As well as a little book about this journey, with exclusive images and personal stories limited to a small amount of copies. Now why and how could this contribute to the protection of these wild animals or be beneficial in any way? The more advertising of Kenya and its issues, the more people will be aware of it, tourism is one of the largest income when it comes to wildlife protection there. Also, I will use my social medias (Instagram ,YouTube, Wordpress) to broadcast how beautiful of a place Kenya is and how the wild animals have the perfect resources to thrive there. I will also talk about the important issues and how people can contribute to this cause. 
What the fund will be used for:
Professional recording equipment, camera with high frame rate for cinematic video footage. (Sony A6500, only one that has in-body image stabilization which would be required in the bush) 
Used Nikon Full-Frame body (D750 or similar, weather sealing needed)
One fast telephoto-lens used 
Backup External Hard Drives to secure all files
High Speed Memory Cards
Realization and printing/Shipping costs of the books and prints
I will also make sure to give a little something to every local from little villages and farms I meet along the way in exchange of their time for a photo or two.
A percentage of the money will be used to foster orphans Elephants, Rhinos and Girafes via The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust in Nairobi, Kenya for a period of at least one year.
My goal isn't about profit, as a quick number add up will show that I won't make any, also I've included the 8-10% fee of Kickstarter as well as took into account bank fees to wire the money and also convert it to the currency needed for me to use in Kenya, if you know me only a little through social media and the content I post, you probably know that I'm used to live a nomadic lifestyle with little to no money at all. I do this kind of photography because transporting people through images and stories is the only thing that matters to me. It's my first time doing this, I've been thinking about it for months, if this project isn't funded I will sadly have to put it aside for now. Meaning I will not witness the wild beasts crossing happening once in a year in late June among other things let alone let this wild dream to experience and share this wild journey with you through Instagram and such. However if this gets funded more than I expected it to be I will donate to Wildlife trusts around Kenya.
Alright I feel like I talked a lot but you still don't really know much about me, if you'd like to checkout My Instagram that would maybe give you an idea on what I do. I'll be posting updates here as well once the project is funded. It probably doesn't mean much to you but I will be eternally thankful to anyone who have given something to contribute to this great adventure.
THANK YOU!

170,1992609436,"Hi, I’m Dany Krom, photographer storyteller and visual artist, with over 12 years of experience covering stories about people, social conflict, cultural diversity and the environmental crisis in South America. In 2011 I began a story in the Uyuni Salt Flats of Bolivia, about the salt workers and their harsh working conditions, due to the nature of this mysterious land.
The Uyuni Salt Flats is the largest salt desert in the world, and most recently has become known as the location of the largest lithium reserve of the world. Lithium, a cleaner energy source, has the potential of shifting the rate at which we are currently contaminating our earth with fossil fuel, by offering an environmentally greener option. A lithium extraction and industrialization plant was launched in this Salt Desert, as a response to the effects of global warming.
THE BOOK
The pictures taken during this initial journey where published in National Geographic’s highly coveted website (Picture of the Day, Editors' Spotlight and Daily Dozen Dec 6 2013), obtaining several distinguished mentions, and attracting the interest and acknowledgment of hundreds of viewers. This inspired me to go back to Uyuni in early 2015 to continue the story. During this second phase of the journey I saw important progress within the lithium plant, and the effects this progress was having within the small communities that reside and work in this area.
Upon finishing this 2nd phase of the story, I had the privilege of showing the results to a great mentor and friend, the Magnum and National Geographic Photographer David Alan Harvey; who confirmed that the story could be of interest to National Geographic Magazine, but that I still had more work to do, and I needed to go back... this time for a longer period of time, to deepen the story, and really offer Nat Geo’s readers a window into the life of the people who live in this mysterious land, and the effect’s the Lithium expansion was having in their day to day lives.
Photo: DKTLP-003
So, here is where Kickstarter comes in. In order to finish the Lithium Planet story, and share the story of this cleaner energy source in the media giant that is National Geographic, I need to raise the necessary funds to complete the expedition.
As a gift to my backers, I will share the adventure with you, by: 
Creating a photo book of the expedition, containing interactive tips, maps, resources, logistic and travel advice as well as stories and photography anecdotes of the expedition. 
 Offer printed and signed photographs of the project in different sizes and print qualities 
Give you access to our interactive blog, where I will post videos and pictures so you can participate in the journey as it is happening.
For those of you interested in photography, stories, exploration and adventure, I have 2 highly coveted spots open for 2 backers to join the team on the journey during the first 2 weeks of this 2 month expedition. 
I am also offering a Meet and Greet the Photographer event in New York, to share about the experience, story and KickStarter campaign, for those interested in learning more about this type of photography projects. 
The details of all the perks, are described in the rewards section to the right. 
DKTLP-001
I am very close to reaching my dream of publishing in one of the most interesting and important magazines of the world. I invite you to support this project and become a part of this expedition. My hope is that through the photo book and interactive blog, you will enjoy the journey and be inspired to create your own Lithium Planet adventure.
The funds of the Kickstarter campaign will be used to: 
Fund the expedition from New York to Uyuni- Bolivia: Covering logistical and transportation expenses, including a driver, guide and lighting assistant for the duration of the journey. We will be staying within the small communities, in hotels when available, and outdoors when not. We will need camping equipment for extreme weather and well as supplies, food and cold weather gear. We will also need to purchase some special equipment in order to capture the unique places in the area, such as dark caves, ancient cemeteries (chullpas) within a cave, etc.
Editing and Printing the photo book, prints and postcards offered as rewards to our Backers: The pledges will go towards editing the photos, designing and printing expenses; as well as any additional expenses in fulfilling the rewards 
The funding goal is our minimum requirement in order to embark on this journey, however as this goal is surpassed, we will be able to upgrade the experience for our backers, and provide better logistical and safety conditions for our team.

A male and a female golden toad, showing sexual dimorphic coloration.
 The Project: The Golden Toad, was a unique Costa Rican amphibian that was thoroughly studied from 1964 – 1988. In 1989 it’s population suddenly dropped, and by 1990 it was feared extinct. While it was never clear exactly what caused its obvious decline, the Golden Toad and it’s story became the poster child for Amphibian Declines world-wide and modern extinction in general. We feel that while the case of the Golden Toad has received a huge amount of attention, there was never a coordinated attempt to rediscover it within its original range, or to search for other localities nearby where it may have fared better than within its known range. Neotropical reptiles and amphibians can be notoriously difficult to locate, and when they inhabit montane habitats they tend to have disjunct and scattered ranges. Our goal with this project is to check the historical localities of this toad during its active breeding season, as well as look for it in new potential localities which we have already assessed via google earth. If we are able to rediscover this species, it will help to raise awareness about the demise of amphibians around the world, but also to call attention to the fact that for many species which would appear to be extinct, their remains a glimmer of hope. This is a search and recover mission, to check every possible Golden Toad habitat still intact in the Tilarán Mountains and to determine whether our suspicions are correct, and that the toad is still hopping around in the cloud forests in the spring. WE ARE NOT LOOKING TO COLLECT THIS TOAD, ONLY TO VERIFY ITS CONTINUED EXISTENCE AND PROVE IT WITH PHOTOGRAPHS AND OBSERVATION DATA. We will not be collecting any specimen on this expedition, only cataloging with photographs, video & audio.  
The infamous male Golden Toad, in all its splendor.
 The Toad: The Golden Toad, Incilius periglenes, is a small Costa Rican amphibian first discovered by scientists in 1964 in a stunted montane cloud forest huddling the continental divide. Immediately upon discovery, the scientists knew they had found something special. The one and half to two inch toad showed remarkable difference between males and females. While females possessed a blackish or greenish ground color with red and white spots, the males were unicolor bright traffic cone orange. The golden toad exhibited an explosive breeding behavior, which took place when the weather in Costa Rica changed from the winter ""dry season"" to the summer ""rainy season"". The toads would only breed right after the first couple thunderstorms had fallen, but before the forest became saturated. These breeding periods rarely lasted more than four or five days, & afterward the toads would disappear for the rest of the year.  The toad's unique appearance, coupled with its extremely unique breeding habits, made it a favorite study subject for scientists working with Costa Rican amphibians, yet very little is know about these toads outside of their brief appearance to bread.
When the Golden Toads were extent, they formed large breeding aggregations where many males would try to breed one female.
Golden Toad Habitat, Monteverde Reserve, Costa Rica.
 The Story: In 1987 researchers working with the Golden Toad, as well as different amphibian species around the world, started noticing a drop in populations. The drop of the toads in Monteverde was especially alarming, because the habitat was intact and appeared to have no negative human influences. However, the drop in these toad's population was one of the most extreme, to the degree that approximately 1500 were seen in 1987, however only 10 were seen in 1988, one in 1989 and from then on no others were verified. Since the early 1990s, undoubtedly no scientist has seen this frog in the wild. It was officially declared extinct in 2004, after more than 15 years of not having been seen anywhere. Due to its unique appearance, habits and rapid extinction, the Golden Toad quickly rose to be the poster child of amphibian declines worldwide, and also to raise awareness about extinction in general. 
Stunted Cloud Forest along the Continental Ridge with heavy epiphyte growth.
The Plan: With recent rediscoveries of various animals previously thought to be extinct, we have decided to organize a coordinated effort to rediscover the Golden Toad, in Costa Rica, in 2014. We plan on taking with us four neotropical herpetologists, from the USA and México, and sample at least five different sites during 5 weeks of the breeding period of the Golden Toad, which starts in late March and runs into early May. The sites to be sampled will include two of the historic Golden Toad localities, where they were common before their purported extinction, as well as over a half a dozen potential sites. The potential sites we have chosen share similar conditions as far as habitat, vegetation, elevation and rainfall go, which are the main indicators for where a species can or can not occur. Our goal is to check each site at least once every three days, in order to not miss even the shortest breeding episode should it occur during the time we are there. When there is rainfall & events necessary for breeding to occur, we will focus on the “historic sites”, afterwards we will scour the “potential sites” for eggs and tadpoles, which would be evidence of on-going breeding which we may have missed.

The Team: Our team has spent the last twelve years actively searching out new species or populations of species of tropical reptiles and amphibians throughout Mexico. We have also worked on rediscovering several populations or species which have thought to be extinct. Among these we have specifically worked with venomous snakes and explosive breeding amphibians. We have been lucky enough to rediscover the Manantlán Long-tailed Rattlesnake in 2008, which had been considered extinct since 1966. We also rediscovered populations of the Sheep Frog in Sonora in 2002, the Montane Burrowing Treefrog in Jalisco in 2007, and the Rowley's Palm Pitviper in the Selva Negra region of Chiapas in 2013. We have discovered approximately seven new species of frog of the genus Syrrhophus, scattered throughout Michoacán, Jalisco, Colima and Guerrero, as well as at least one new species of rattlesnake in the states of Guerrero, Morelos, Michoacán and México. Furthermore we have added more than 30 species to the known herpetofauna of Colima, and published another 50 or so new range extensions or state records for around México.

Where Your Donations Are Going: What we are planning to raise is the money needed for the airfare costs for our team to go to Costa Rica, as well as auto rental costs for a 4x4 truck and gas and transportation costs. Our equipment cost, food, stay and time we will cover ourselves, as we have done with other projects that we have funded. Our progress and preparation for the trip will be posted weekly on a Facebook Group for our participants and funders to follow along on. Our results and successes will be posted on our own Save the Golden Toad project website, to be launched before the trip and to be thoroughly updated throughout the trip. Of course if we are able to over fund this project we will be able to cover more expenses and have more field hands, which can increase the chances of success.

GunFight! is hard at work on the follow up to 2010's Frontier Land, AND IT'S GOING GREAT. We are working with the oh-so-talented producer and engineer Jeff Berner (galuminumfoil.com), AND we're hoping--for the first time ever--to press this new record to SMOOTH, DELICIOUS VINYL!
Oh... but, uh... we're outta money. (Oops.)
FEAR NOT, for we have a saying over here at Camp GunFight!: ""When life sweeps the leg, counter with an illegal crane-kick to the face."" It means, ""ask your friends for money"" (like the mysterious, handsy old man next-door told you to).
Real talk: if you've reached this Kickstarter page, it's likely because you have seen us live, heard our music online or own our first album. Maybe you've gotten sweaty with us at a loft show, or broken the ""NO DANCING"" rule at your regular watering hole. Maybe you witnessed Tony playing bass in his underwear or even hopped on stage to join us for a drunken encore. In any case, your good times are the greatest gift we could ever ask for. But we do need to ask one more favor of you to keep the good times rolling. We kindly ask that you support us with a donation toward our new record.
Not only will your generosity keep the GunFight! legend alive, but you'll also be rewarded with one (or more!) of the gifts listed on the right-hand side of this page. They range from a digital copy of the new album, to the vinyl version, to a fancy dinner with the band and mucho more. It's totally worth it, man!
Most importantly, we'd like to thank you for the years of love and support, both in spirit and in wallet. We treasure you. (We really, really do!)

173,60470906,"Death Bay is an Anthology film based on North Bay, Ontario Canada.  The film will be made of four (4) short films directed by different directors.  Each film will be based on different elements of North Bay.
The breakdown of the films, what they are based on and directed by who will be:
 The Shack - After years of going ice fishing on the last weekend of February, Hank sticks to his tradition, even if it kills him.  Directed by Darren D. MacDonald  (Director of  
 The Itch - After not heeding to the caution of others, Chad finds himself in water that gives him the itch... on the inside. Directed by Kiefer Friday  (Director of short film 
 The Shad-fly - Shad-flies have a life span of 2 days, these shad-flies, mutated by pollution, make every death count...This film does not yet have a director as of yet.  If we do not find a director interested in the production Darren, Kiefer and Renee (Directors of the other films) will collaboratively direct and create this short.
 The Monster at the End of Trout Lake - After hearing of the legend of the Trout Lake Monster, Flora brings her travelling Myths and Legends Vlog to North Bay.  Is this one myth she can't bust?  Directed by Renée Cleroux (Director of  
Why I Care About The Project
One of the main reasons why I started the project was because of the green message that is present in all of the short films.  The concept of these is at a surface level about elements of North Bay and the surrounding area, but it can’t just be that.  There needs to be a message and a core belief in the shorts.
With all of the nature present around  North Bay, it’s a message that makes sense with the surface idea.  This is the message of each film:
The Shack is a film about environmental climate change and how it can impact people, specifically Ice Fishers.
The Itch is about respecting the seasons and about respecting the environment.
The Shad-fly is a cautionary tale about pollution.
The Monster At The End Of Trout Lake is about respecting animals and the boundaries of nature.
How we Plan to Make it Happen
With your help and a group of like-minded artists, we will make this project possible. While I will be overseeing the whole operation, I will be giving the directors of the shorts the free range to make the film that they want to make, while making sure that it fits within the mood and the theme of the overall project.
We will do this by having regular contact between the directors of the project and myself.  To make sure that we don’t bite off more than we can chew we will be tackling one film at a time.  With the nature of the films taking on a different season each, it also makes sense to do this.
With one film being a lot of work on its own, this makes sure that there will never be too much going on at one time.  This will allow artists directing other films to help out on films that they aren’t directing, creating a community with a singular goal of completing the project.
The Impact
The project will solely be funded by crowdfunding, so the contribution that we gather will be vital for the production of the shorts.  It will be thanks to our contributors that will make everything we make in this project possible.  
Other Ways You Can Help
If you cannot contribute in a form of contributing, we are always open to collaborating!
Can you do Special Effects?
Do you live near us and want to help with the production?
Do you paint and want to make posters?
Do you know other languages (other than English) and can make other language subtitles?
And much more.
Then contact us at LightsInTheSkyProductions@gmail.com and let us know how you can help.  Even if you think whatever you have to offer is stupid, contact us, because it might just be the thing that we are looking for.
Thank you for your time, and I hope you consider helping out make The Death Bay a possibility."

175,1719875514,"After injuring myself in a hiking accident, I cannot skate nearly as much as I would like, nor how I'd like with enduring a serious amount of pain. I therefore decided to use my fine art skills on my own brand of skateboard decks, which I dubbed grafsk8. 
Spray paint has always been an important medium to my fine art gallery works, and I decided to apply it to a skateboard. When I was complete, I loved it. All I could think of was doing it again; creating another deck. I then started thinking about the cookie-cutter decks out there today, and especially the price people pay for them. 
After running numbers, with a start-up I can easily produce customized, hand-painted decks for cheaper than the larger companies. My overhead is in blank decks and paint--I am confident that in a first order of twenty blank decks, and the paint--my cost would be roughly $12 a deck. 
In the market at $25 a deck, I can undercut competitors with hand painted originals, rather than assembly line graphics, by quite a bit, and still retain a decent profit margin.
The business model remains sound, unless the demand outstrips the supply--in which case, there is already a plan in motion. There are two other artists I have on standby to help me create new decks and deck concepts--no two will ever be the same. 
The money now is specifically to place an order for blank skateboard decks, stencil paper, paint, and polyurethane to create a stock based on the template board I have gotten such great feedback about. "

180,1608517572,"Twenty-eight years after its founding during the height of the AIDS crisis, MIX continues to galvanize, promote and distribute the work of queer culture-makers, with a goal of providing high-quality queer programming that is not only immersive, innovative and experiential, but that also builds a sustainable queer community that is reflective and participatory. MIX fosters a highly-engaged, politicized, and enthusiastic audience that is hungry for imagery and programming that directly speaks to, highlights, addresses, challenges and inspires the community to see and think in new ways about issues such as AIDS, censorship and representation, safe sex, drugs, dating, coming out, violence, homophobia, racism, family, and non/assimilation. 
COMMITMENT TO MAKERS
When given the chance, MIX provides audiences with access to emerging and established artists whose work focuses on radical and alternative notions of gender and sexuality, while also uprooting traditional categories of form and content. As an organization, MIX is a laboratory and incubator created to explore work that has never been seen before, or that has been rarely presented. MIX has also provided considerable support for emerging makers. Jonathan Caouette submitted his unfinished film Tarnation to MIX in 2003. Then co-director Stephen Winter identified the film's potential, and shepherded it to completion, bringing on Gus Van Sant as an executive producer, and another editor. The film premiered at MIX and then went on to Cannes and the New York Film Festival and subsequently worldwide distribution. 
COMMUNITY SUPPORT

Suffice it to say, $12,000 is a very conservative estimate!
MIX would not exist without the support of our community, through volunteering their time and energy and attending the festival in record breaking numbers every year. The past two (almost three) decades prove that there is a need for a platform for work that represents and resonates with our audiences.
Given the challenging nature of the work presented at MIX and the strong integrity behind its curatorial process, the corporate sponsorships that fund most film festivals are not readily available to us, so we are asking for your individual support. While we have an amazingly dedicated team of volunteers and staff, it costs a good deal of money to put on the festival and your financial gift will allow us to deliver the 28th installment of the MIX NYC - NY Queer Experimental Film Festival (#MIXNYC2015).
(estimates)
Every dollar pledged will make a difference as we will lose it all if even a dollar short of our goal. The MIX NYC team have worked hard to curate a selection of fantastic rewards from committed artists and individuals in the MIX NYC community.
HANDSOME REWARDS
Pledgers will receive many handsome rewards in return for their support. We have sourced unique memorabilia, archives of the festival's programming, tools to create and inspire, and an impressive array of offerings from legends such as John Cameron Mitchell and Barbara Hammer to thrilling new designs from fresh young designers such as the bold and revolutionary king of showmanship, BCalla, and our very own creative visionary Diego Montoya.

Firstly, we are communicating with you through our discoverer, translator, and sometimes business manager, Prof. Nigel Quentin Fontanelle Dumblucke IV. He, for some uncanny reason, is able to communicate with us telepathically. This bodes well, as we don't speak, much less type. Typical HCTM sounds include grunts, howls, and the occasional dusty fart (whooosh).
HCTM is now putting the polishing touches on CRYPTIC  our sixth studio album. It's all happening at the Crypt™, our kick-ass secret lair/ studio. It is coming out seriously badass (like those dusty farts) and the *new songs are some of our most infectious to date.
Here's the rub, y'all: (Dr. Dumblucke, you better translate your lab-coat-covered ass off here!) The cost associated with producing and promoting CRYPTIC with an eye towards getting radio play is simply mind-bottling. Even for this very successful, efficient, independent band, a large-scale, coordinated marketing blitz, including hiring a reputable PR firm, has been out of reach. 
So, we hope you accept this sexy-ass mission: Take HCTM to the next tier (trail of tiers?). Push CRYPTIC off the jaunty edge… of the lip… of the fringe… of the precipice into the wild blue. Just ask our rabid fans, HCTM is poised to take off! We will reward you handsomely for your efforts, baby. RRRRrrrrrgh!
Smooches, 
HCTM

182,2112307601,"He came to the stage in a time when women in Kabul wore mini-skirts, foreigners flocked to Afghanistan on the “hippie trail,” and progressive change swept the country. Ahmad Zahir rocketed to stardom in the 60s and 70s, his voice capturing the soul of an entire generation. No other icon in Afghan history can allow us to more deeply explore a country that could have been, and unravel what such a progressive legacy means for the world today.
Despite being a household name for tens of millions of Afghans across the globe, and an inspiration to many others, to this day, there has never been a film about Ahmad Zahir... until now. 
This Kickstarter campaign is to support the production of the first-ever film about Ahmad Zahir. Executive produced by his daughter Shabnam, and directed by Oscar-nominated Sam French, the film will explore this icon of Afghan culture in an intimate yet universal way.
Join us and become an essential part of making the first film about Ahmad Zahir!
او درزمانی به صحنه آمد که زنان در کابل دامن کوتاه میپوشید و خارجی های زیادی که از دسته هیپی به افغانستان سفر داشتن به که این اتفاقات کشور افغانستان را به سوی ترقی و تغییر سوق میداد
احمد ظاهر در دهه ۶۰ و ۷۰ آغاز به خواندن نمود و با صدایش گیرایش روح تمام هم نسلانش را تسخیر میکرد
با اینکه در هر خانواده افغان حداقل یکی از فرزند ها به افتخار به نام او نامگذاری میشود با همین حال تا بحال هیچ فلیمی درباره اش ساخته نشده
به همین دلیل ما کمپاین کیکستارتر را برای حمایت از تولید اولین فلیم درباره احمد ظاهر براه انداخته ای ایده تولید این فیلم توسط دختر اش شبنم طرح شده وقرار است با کارگردانی سم فرانسوی تولید شده تا به شیوه ای ماهرانه و جهانی به تصویر شود.پش باما بپوندید و بخش اساسی در ساختن اولین فیلم در مورد این استوره باشید
WHO IS AHMAD ZAHIR? 
احمد ظاهر کیست؟
Ahmad Zahir is born into privilege, the son of Afghanistan's Prime Minister under King Zahir Shah. This makes it highly unlikely and controversial that he would pursue a musical career. But from an early age, he is obsessed with music, and starts collecting records from all over the world.
Ahmad Zahir goes on to study under famous Afghan folk musicians, and he also travels widely, becoming exposed to the burgeoning musical revolution of the 60s in America, Europe and India. These varied musical influences, along with his love of Afghanistan's most notable poet, Rumi as well as ancient Persian poetry, lead him to forge an entirely new musical style, synthesizing Western rock with traditional Afghan music.
Sporting Elvis-like sideburns, his flamboyant, loud style and poetic lyrics create an atmosphere of intense enthusiasm during his live shows. No one had ever seen anything like Ahmad Zahir before. In the late 60s, recordings of his shows are being passed around on tapes from person to person, played in living rooms across the country. Ahmad Zahir takes the country by storm.
احمد ظاهر در خانواده نخست وزیر سلطنت ظاهر شاه به دنیا آمد که به همین دلیل علاقه اوبه موسیقی یک امر خیلی نامطلوب و بحث برانگیز بوداما با وجود این او از همان اوایل به موسیقی علاقه مندبود و به جمع آوری نوار های ضبط شده موسیقی از سراسر جهان آغاز نمود
احمد ظاهر به تحصیل رشته موسیقی اصیل افغانی پرداخته و بعدا به طور گسترده به سفرکردن به دور جهان روی میاورد مه این سفر ها در دوره رشد موسیقی ۶۰ ساله در آمریکا، اروپا و هند بوده مه تاثیران موسیقی متنوع همراه با عشق اش به شاعران برجسته افغانستان ، رومی و اشعار باستانی زبان فارسی باعث شد که او به ایجاد یک سبک موسیقی کاملا جدید موسیقی غربی و سنتی افغانستان دست بزند
حرکات زیبا، سبک بلند و اشعار زیبا در جریان اجرای زنده فضای با شور و شوقی ره ایجاد میکرد طوریکه تا آن زمان اجرایی به اون زیبایی نادر بود. دراواخر دهه ۶۰ نوار های ضبط شده از اجرای زنده او از شخصی به شخصی منتقل شده و در هر خانه به نمایش گذاشته میشد و طوفان به پا می کرد
By the early 70s, he has become a household name, singing live shows on the radio and recording his first studio album “Dilak Am” in 1973. But the world is changing, and events are about to thrust Afghanistan into political upheaval, forever altering the course of its future.
In 1973, mere months after Ahmad Zahir’s father resigns as Prime Minister, Daoud Khan overthrows the current government and installs himself as President of the newly formed Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. Ahmad Zahir initially supports this new government, which attempts to lessen the country’s reliance on the Soviet Union and build up Afghanistan’s military forces. But as he begins to see promises unfulfilled, he starts to speak out through his lyrics, agitating for social reform. In his song “Ajab Sabri Khoda Darad” (1976) Zahir sings:
If I were God… when seeing one shivering and naked and another clothed in a hundred colors, I would tear up the earth and sky.
All the while, Communist sympathies are on the rise, and in 1978, Daoud Khan is overthrown in a bloody coup backed by the Soviets, who install a puppet government. Ahmad Zahir refuses to recognize the government’s legitimacy, and his lyrics become even more political. In one of the last songs he recorded, “Man Nagoyam,” he sings of a bird trapped inside a cage: 
Liberate me, liberate me, liberate me. Oh, how the thought of homelessness haunts me. Please save my home.
His voice captures the spirit of the resistance. As a result, the Soviets blacklist his music. Then, on June 14, 1979, he is suddenly killed in a car crash near the Salang Pass. His only daughter Shabnam was also born this day. While a car accident is the “official” line, most Afghans believe he was shot in the head, murdered by the communist regime. 
What really happened in that remote mountain pass remains a mystery to this day.
Upon learning of his death, schools across the country close, and men and women in the thousands pour onto the streets to follow his coffin. An era has ended. 
در اوایل دهه ۷۰ بخش زنده از طریق امواج رادیو نشر میکرد و همچنان اولین آلبوم اش به نام دلکم را ضبط کرد
در همین جریان جهان درحال تغییر وحوادثی در حال رخ دادن بودکه باعث تحولات شدید سیاسی در اففانستان درحال رخ دادن بود. در سال ۱۹۷۳ تنها چند ماه پس از آنکه پدر احمد ظاهر از سمت اش به عنوان نخست وزیر استعفا داد، داوود خان دولت فعلی آن زمان را سرنگون کرده و خود را به عنوان رئیس جمهور جدید دولت جمهوری دمکرات افغانستان اعلان کرد
احمد ظاهر در اوایل از دولت جدید حمایت میکرد و به این عقیده بود که دولت جدید در تلاش است تا وابستگی افغانستان را به اتحاد جماهیر شوروی را کاهش بدهد و درکنار آن میکوشد تا نیروی نظامی افغانستان را تقویت کند اما با گذشت زمان ناکاری این دولت آشکار شد طوری که بشتر شعار ها فقط به عنوان شعار باقی میماندند و عملی نمی شدند این اوضاع باعث شد تا احمد ظاهر بر علیه دولت وقت سخن میگفت و از هنر بر علیه این دولت استفاده مکرد. او آهنگی به نام عجب صبری خدا دارد را به رابطه اوضاع دولت آن زمان سرود ۱۹۷۶
اگر من جاي او بودم
كه ميديدم يكي عريان و لرزان، ديگري پوشيده از صد جامه رنگين
زمين و آسمان را
واژگون ، مستانه ميكردم
در عین حال در سال 1978، داوود خان در یک کودتای خونین تحت حمایت اتحادیه جماهیر شوروی ، سرنگون شد. احمد ظاهر از پذیرش مشروعیت حکومت خودداری می کرد و اشعار وی سیاسی ترقبل می شد
او در یکی از آخرین آهنگ های که ضبط کرده است (من نگویم)، درباره یک پرنده‌ای که درون قفس را به دام افتاده است میخواند
من نگویم که مرا از قفس آزاد کنید
  قفسم برده به باغی و دلم شاد کنید
در صدای او روح مقاومت موج میزد که در نتیجه شوروی سابق موسیقی او را در لیست سیاه قرار داد.و سپس، در 14 جون ۱۹۷۹، او به طور ناگهانی در یک تصادف موتر در نزدیکی کوتل سالنگکشته شد
تنها دختر اش شبنم نیزدر این روز به دنیا آمد
این حادثه فقط به عنوان ""کاغذ اداره رسمی"" ثبت است، در صورتی که اکثر افغان ها معتقدند که او توسط رژیم کمونیست به قتل رسیده است
آنچه واقعا در این کوتل کوهستانی دور افتاده اتفاق افتاده است، تا امروز مثل یک راز ناگشوده است
پس از باخبر شدن ازمرگ او مکاتب در سراسر کشور تعطیل شده و هزازان زن و مرد برای مراسم خاکسپاری او به خیابان ها ریختن
Ahmad Zahir’s death presages events to come. As the Soviets cement their hold on the country, the US-backed Mujahedeen forces take up arms and mount an insurgency. Afghanistan becomes a hot front in an otherwise Cold War. The Soviet government is overthrown in the mid-80s, sparking a civil war which is eventually won by the Taliban, who install a severely conservative religious government. 
The Taliban outlaw music and free expression. As a symbol of the new rules under their regime, they publicly burn Ahmad Zahir’s tapes and desecrate his grave. 
In 2001, after the events of 9/11, a US-backed coalition overthrows the Taliban, plunging the country into ever more conflict, which continues to this day. 
But through it all, Ahmad Zahir’s voice lives on in the hearts and minds of the Afghan people. His music is still played throughout the country, and is the one common thread that connects all Afghans in the diaspora all across the world who have fled their home over the decades. And he has inspires a new generation of musicians and activists to dream of a better future. His legacy truly lives on. 
Ahmad Zahir’s voice will lead the way... 
Drink up your glass Turn the night into day
Forget the sadness of the world
What is life?
Continuous worrying
Dying under a wall of hope
Being two-faced is not our tradition
Both my day & night are the same color
You forgot about me
The road of separation deepened between us
Drink up your glass
Turn the night into day
Forget the sadness of the world.
.پس از مرگ احمد ظاهر نیروهای مجاهدین تحت حمایت ایالات متحده آمریکا موفق تلاش میکرد تا قوای شوروی سابق را از افغانستان بیرون کنند که این اتفاق اوضاع این کشور را بدتر نمود وافغانستان به یک جنگ سرد دیگربین قدرت‌های آن زمان تبدیل شد. حکومت شوروی در اواسط دهه 80 سرنگون شد و جنگ داخلی دراین کشور بین مجاهدین و طالبان آغاز شد و درنتیجه کشور به دست طالبان در آمد وطالبان که حکومتی بسیارتند رو و مذهبی بود موسیقی را در کشور ممنوع اعلان نموده و نوارهای ضبط شده از آواز احمد ظاهر را در ملا عام به آتش کشیدن و قبر اش را تخریب کردند
در سال ۲۰۰۱، پس از حادثه ۱۱ سپتامبر، یک ائتلاف تحت حمایت ایالات متحده برای از بین بردن حکومت طالبان تشکیل شده تا این حکومت را سرنگون کند، اما این تلاش تا به امروز ادامه دارد و این کشور هنوز با مشکل حضور طالبان به شدت درگی است اما با این حال ، صدای احمد ظاهر در قلب و ذهن مردم افغانستان زنده است. موسیقی او هنوز در سراسر کشور پخش می شده و یکی از موضوعات مشترک بین تمام افغان های که در سراسر جهان از دهه های گذشته مهاجر اند، متصل می کند. و او الهام بخش نسل جدیدی از نوازندگان و فعالان که در رویای آینده ای بهتر است میباشد. میراث او واقعا زنده است.

  WHY MAKE A FILM ?
چرااین فیلم را می سازید؟
AHMAD ZAHIR is a film that tells the story of an Afghan musical legend whose life symbolizes an Afghanistan that no longer exists but remains present in the hearts of its people. 
AHMAD ZAHIR is not strictly a music documentary. We approach Ahmad Zahir’s life as a way into this turbulent period of Afghanistan’s history. Our film paints a picture of a country that could have been, and the timeless power of one man’s legacy to unite an entire people. We explore the 60s and 70s through his eyes, and through the eyes of the people he inspired with his music. 
احمد ظاهر یک فیلم است که داستان افسانه ای خواننده افغان را به تصویر می کشد که زندگی اش نماد یک افغانستان است بااینکه او دیگر بین ما نیست اما همیشه در قلب مردم حضور خواهد داشت
فیلم احمد ظاهر فقط یک مستند در باره یک خواننده نیست. بلکه ما از زندگی احمدظاهر به عنوان راهی برای این دوره آشفته تاریخ افغانستان استفاده میکنیم. فیلم ما تصویری از یک کشور است و قدرت بی انتهای میراث یک مرد برای متحد کردن تمام مردم را به نمایش می کشد. ما میخواهیم دهه ۶۰ و ۷۰ را از طریق چشمان اوکه از طریق موسیقی اش مردم را الهام میبخشید، کشف کنیم 
By using a wealth of archival footage – much of which has never been seen before – we paint a vivid picture of Afghanistan in the 1970s: a time of prosperity, freedom and hope that lives on in the dreams of those who experienced it, both the Afghans who grew up during that time and the foreigners who visited on the hippie trail.
با استفاده از مجموعه ای از فیلم های بایگانی - که بیشتر آنها هرگز قبل ازاین دیده نشده است - ما یک تصویر واضح از افغانستان در دهه ۱۹۷۰ را زسامی می کنیم: زمان رونق، آزادی و امید که در رویاهایی آنانی که این حس زیبا را تجربه کرده اند،هردو چه افغانهایی که در آن زمان بزرگ شده بودند و خارجیانی که به شکل هیپی به افغانستان سفر داشتند.
Ahmad Zahir’s story allows us to unravel and explore a new version of Afghanistan’s history, one rarely, if ever, explored outside of the Afghan context. Yet it is relevant to all of us, and shares unnerving similarities with the current political landscape in the United States. How does one musician’s legacy continue, and what does it say about the present and future of this nation, but also of the world we live in?
Despite his popularity and influence across the globe, there has never before been a feature documentary film made about Ahmad Zahir. 
Millions of Afghans are waiting for this. Today, there are entire radio stations in Kabul devoted to playing only Ahmad Zahir’s music, and his songs are not just played in Afghanistan, but by all Afghans living around the world. Ahmad Zahir is loved by all tribes and classes of Afghans and Tajiks. During a time when Uzbeks and Hazaras dealt with constant racism, Ahmad Zahir broke barriers by connecting with those audiences without prejudice. He is the thread that has tied the country together throughout the past 40 years of war, and is one of the only surviving symbols of an Afghanistan that once was.
With that thread, we weave the story of a unique time in Afghanistan’s history, and of a people still striving to chart their own destiny. Ahmad Zahir, in essence, is a unique beacon of hope for not only Afghanistan, but for all of us trying to survive in a troubled world.
داستان احمد ظاهر به ما این اجازه را می دهد تا نسخه جدیدی از تاریخ افغانستان را کشف کنیم، چیزی که به ندرت، تا کنون، خارجی درمورد افغانستان مورد میدانند درست وضعیتی که به شدت شباهت وضعیت فعلی سیاست‌های آمریکا است
.هم چنان علی رغم محبوبیت و نفوذش در سراسر جهان، هیچوقت فیلم مستند دیگری درباره احمد ظاهر ساخته نشده است
درحال حاضرمیلیون ها افغان در انتظار آن هستند . امروزه کل استشن های رادیویی در کابل وجود دارد که تنها به پخش موسیقی احمد ظاهر اختصاص دارد و آهنگ های او فقط در افغانستان پخش نمی شود، بلکه توسط تمام افغان هایی که در سراسر جهان زندگی می‌کنند شنیده میشود. احمد ظاهر از همه قبایل و طبقات افغانها علاقه مندانی دارد و تنها مربوط به یک قشر یا قوم نمیشود .احمد ظاهر در زمانی که ازبک ها و هزاره ها با تعصبات بین اقوام مواجه بودند، با آنها توسط موسیقی‌اش ارتباط برقرار میکرد و تعصب و موانع دراین بخش را از بین برد. موسیقی وی یکی ازموضوعاتی است که در طول 40 سال جنگ مردم را با کشوریکه از آن دور هستند به ارتباط بسازد و یکی از نمادهای ماندگاری است که افغانستان آن را در خود به یک بار دیده است

SOME COMMON QUESTIONS ... 
! سوالات عمومی ...
We restarted our Kickstarter campaign on Sept 8. Since then, we have had some questions about why and how this works, and we wanted to be transparent with our backers about the whole process. So, here are answers to some common questions we have received: 
ما کمپین کیکستارتر را به تاریخ ۸ سپتامبر آغاز کردیم و از همان آغاز سوالاتی وجود داشت که چرا و چگونه میخواهیم این کار را انجام دهیم. و اینجا میخواهیم به این سوالات جواب بدهیم تا این پروسه برای افرادی که از ما حمایت میکنند واضح و شفاف باشد. سوال های معمولا مطرح میشوند به صورت ذیل میباشد.
""You asked for $150,000 and now you are OK with $50,000?  Why 50,000?"" 
Our overall budget hasn't changed.  Based on our following and the passion we were seeing for this film, we believed we could get $150,000 from Kickstarter.  Perhaps we still could, but if we don't reach our goal, we would get nothing and this film would not get made.  We don't want to risk that, so instead we are cutting the budget to assure a successful campaign.  We still hope to raise $150,000, but $50,000 is the bare minimum to get us started. 
""اولین بار شما مقدار ۱۵۰۰۰۰ کمک نقدی را درخواست کرده بودید حالا چرا آن مقدار به ۵۰۰۰۰ رسیده؟""
بودجه ساخت فیلم تغییری نکرده و ما هنوز امید داریم که موفق به جمع آوری مقدار ۱۵۰۰۰۰ شویم اما با این ها ما ۵۰۰۰۰ دالر را برای کمترین مبلغ برای ساخت این فیلم در نظر گرفته ایم زیرا ما میخواهیم که به هرصورت ممکن به ساخت این فیلم بپردازیم
""Documentaries are cheap to make, you just need a camera.  Why are you asking for so much?""
People don't realize that documentaries, especially if done well, are actually extremely expensive! For this film, we estimate that just the archive video footage will cost more than $100,000.  Our total expenses will exceed $500,000.  Every penny of the donations from Kickstarter are going to pay for the initial development of the film and will allow us to keep creative control of the film.  If we were to sell the rights of Ahmad Zahir to a big film company right now, they will have their own ideas for the film and we would not get to make the beautiful vision we have in mind. So, we are trying to keep as independent as we can as we make this movie. Your donations help us do that.
 ""ساخت فیلم های مستند مصرف زیادی نیازی ندارند چرا شما به این مقدار پول نیاز دارید؟""
معمولا درک فیلم های مستند ساده برای همه آسان نیست ولی اگر فیلمی به صورت حرفه ای که عوام فهم باشد ساخته شود هزینه ای زیادی نیاز دارد ما تنها برای دستیابی به فیلم های آرشیف به مقدار ۱۰۰۰۰ دالر نیاز داریم. هزینه کل این فیلم مبلغی بیشتر از ۵۰۰۰۰ دالر میباشد و ما به شما اطمینان میدهیم که هر پنی از کمک های مالی شما در ساخت این فیلم مصرف خواهد شد و واضح است که مقدار بیشتر کمک مالی به ما این امکان را میدهد تا با خلاقیت بیشتر و بصورت خیلی حرفه ای این فیلم را بسازیم. درعین حال اگر ما برای ساخت این فیلم از شرکت های بزرگ فیلم سازی کمک بخواهیم واضح است که آنها تغییراتی در جزئیات این فیلم خواهند آورد که ما به هیچ وجه خواهان آن نیستیم.به همین دلیل ما میخواهیم این فیلم را به طور مستقل بسازیم و برای این کار ما به کمک های نقدی شما نیاز داریم
""Why would we donate money to a film when there are so many worthy causes in Afghanistan that need our money?""
This is a worthy cause! This film will be a positive message about our country, our people, and our history.  This is a film about standing up for what you believe in.  In a time when everything we see and hear about Afghanistan is negative, a positive and beautiful film like this can inspire and change people through storytelling and art. It is hard to put a value on that but we hope you agree that this film is a worthwhile endeavor.
""چرا شما میخواهید برای ساخت یک فیلم این مقدار پول را هزینه کنید درصورتیکه خیلی موضوعات مهم دیگر در افغانستان هست که به این پول نیاز دارند؟""
ساختن این فیلم یک دلیل ارزشمند دارد! این فیلم پیامی مثبت در مورد کشور ما، مردم ما و تاریخ ما خواهد داشت. این یک فیلم درباره ایستادن برای چیزی است که شما به آن اعتقاد دارید. در زمانی که همه چیزهایی که ما درباره افغانستان می بینیم و می شنویم منفی است، یک فیلم مثبت و زیبا مانند این می تواند مردم را از طریق بیان داستان و هنر الهام بخشیده و نظر شان را تغییر دهد. ارزش‌گذاری بالای این فیلم دشوار است، اما ما امیدواریم شمابا باارزش بودن این فیلم موافقت کنید
""Your film team involves non-Afghans - how do I know they have the best interest of Afghans in mind?""
This film is being produced by Afghan refugees and first generation Afghans.  We have an American director (Sam French) and an American producer (Mo Scarpelli) involved, not because they are controlling the project, but because they are really talented at what they do AND they have compassion for Afghanistan and Ahmad Zahir's legacy. 
Ahmad Zahir's daughter Shabnam is the film's executive producer and Baktash Ahadi is one of our producers. Both fled Afghanistan when they were young just like so many of us.  
Our Kickstarter"
video was made in English to help us reach the widest audience possible. We are working on Farsi/Dari subtitles for the video, and we are in the process of translating the English text on this page to Farsi/Dari as well. You can rest assured that the film itself will be comprised of mostly Afghan voices and shot mainly in Afghanistan or areas where Afghan diaspora will be interviewed. We have already done dozens of interviews with Afghans in Afghanistan and plan to do more. Many Afghan journalists based in Afghanistan have relayed their appreciation to make this film and believe it's a project that needs to be made.,

183,476198466,"We are four artists excited to collaborate on an original artwork for High Desert Test Sites 2013! HDTS is a weeklong series of interdisciplinary projects to be presented between Joshua Tree, California and Albuquerque, New Mexico, from October 12th-19th, 2013. Our goal for this internationally regarded event is to create an artwork that allows HDTS audiences to join in a collaborative exchange about experiences in the landscape.
We plan to create a limited edition publication, which we describe as a mapbook. It’s a hybrid inspired by maps, atlases, reference texts and the form of the volvelle, a charting tool with rotating parts. Our project’s title, Collaboratively Determined Telluric Sites, is based on the concept of telluric currents, which are electric currents that run through much of the earth's surface.
Background: On the Road
In preparation for the HDTS event, we went scouting for telluric currents over more than 700 miles of high desert between Joshua Tree and Albuquerque. We met in Los Angeles, where three of us live, with the fourth flying in from Minnesota. We visited several significant sites, including Amboy Crater and Meteor Crater, and were surprised when our travels and conversation led us to unexpected destinations.
Some of the ways we each took readings of telluric currents
The Mapbook
Our mapbook, which will be printed in an edition of 1,000 and distributed for free to participants at this fall’s HDTS event, will document our experience and how we question various “currents” encountered at sites along our collective path.
The mapbook will also provide readers with an opportunity to map and share their own journeys. We intend to use these individual maps to create an ever-more collaborative map of a broader telluric universe. We hope you will be a part of this expanding network! Your funds will allow us to create a lushly printed mapbook that suggests a non-linear view of the landscape and an alternate means of engaging with visual and tactile information. 
The first part of the mapbook will describe the framework of our project in text and images and give examples of telluric currents we encountered during our scouting expedition.
Map of the road
The second part, a 16” x 16” foldout map, will show the connection between our path and a constellation of meanings. 
Our fold-out map in progress
The third section is a 12” x 8” volvelle template in which participants may map and write about their own telluric currents and mail back to us to us. We’ll make it easy and even cover the return postage. 
A detail of the template readers may alter
Where are you on the map?
We hope you join in our collaborative “current” through your contribution. Thank you!

184,899856116,"When a secluded and forgotten mansion becomes open to the public, two friends are the first to enter it in thirty years. Thomas, an adventure video blogger, faces his most anticipated location yet, 'The Levisson Mansion' and invites his estranged childhood friend, Leo, as an attempt to rekindle their once-strong friendship. The unexpected occurs when they discover a decrepit, yet functioning, elevator in the basement that doesn't go to floors above, but down, deep into the unknown. The two let their childhood curiosity take over and flip the switch for 'down'.
Concept/Storyboard Art - 'The Entrance'
Concept/Storyboard Art - 'The Shaft'
There will be another 8 original pieces done for the film, and all 10 will be sent to backers (see rewards section 'Original Storyboard Art' and 'Storyboard Art Prints').
Thomas' adventure will take place at the Levisson Estate in the middle of winter at the base of Mt Ruapehu in the central North Island of New Zealand. The landscape is striking in beauty, covered in pine trees and tussock, but also isolated, exposed to freezing winds, and blanketed in snow.
Thomas
Thomas has a new lease on life and struggles with the mundane. He's making up for a far less spontaneous and exciting childhood, these days opting to go after the things that stir his curiosity and imagination. His desire for challenging adventure, physical activity and sharing his stories via video blogging only increases with each upload. Thomas is furiously chasing the ultimate adventure.
Leo
Leo's gloomy outlook on life gives people the impression of 'damaged goods', often allowing him to say things that are shocking or out of line. People keep Leo at a distance, not expecting much of him, and most of the time, they'd be justified in doing so. Unlike Thomas, Leo is only along because he's curious as to why Thomas invited him after their relation suffered a severe falling out many years before. 
All the locals know the name, none have seen the man in decades. Thomas asked around but all he came up with was a kind of 'Levisson Folklore'... just stories of the man, based on rumors. Every avenue came up empty; he even traced their family origins to Iceland, but couldn't find an official connection. Soon enough, Thomas set his eyes on the mansion itself, hoping the answers would be found inside. The missing millionaire was the sole owner the family mining company, which was handed down from his grandfather, the first family immigrant who built the Levisson Mansion in 1921. Police have assured that the search for Mr. Levisson is still ongoing. 
Mikey
With two young boys at home, playtime can get a little immature at best. This outlet has proved to be great for Mikey getting mature about his dream to make memorable movies. He has directed five short films, tutored Film Practice at Massey University, Auckland, and has nearly completed his second fiction novel. Mikey plans to write and make movies for the rest of his life.
Nicholas
Nick has an uncanny ability to binge watch movies or TV without fatigue, though his wife of three years has finally tamed his wild appetites. The most experienced in the team, Nick has been editing and producing TV for 20 years. His wealth of knowledge always comes in handy at the right time and has some great tricks up his sleeves. 
Tim
In between cleaning up vomit from his kids and making up voices for pet dinosaurs, Tim is the co-founder of a game studio in Kingsland, Auckland. He is the creator of Aethasia, the fictional world of their first game and is co-authoring a series of books to go along with it. Tim has a wild imagination has made great contributions to the story thus far.
 ""The found footage style is popular these days, in fact, they're a dime a dozen, some producing good results, some not. In many cases, I tend to shy away from them when choosing a movie because too often, the style is distracting to me more than immersing. That's the problem, when it's token instead of an intentional decision to target a specific feeling or effect. In the video I said the goal of this movie is to make the most claustrophobic movie ever made. The decision to shoot found footage stemmed out of this goal, as did the writing of the characters, the choice of cameras and camera positioning, the location of the mansion, the sets, prop design, and script. In this film, the choice to go 'found footage' is as far from token as you can get, and I assure you, it will be unforgettable.""

185,1590038826,"It was March in Chicago, and the snow lingered in the streets like a bad cough. Hipsters and teamsters huddled around steaming cups of coffee, fighting off the cold leaking in around their windows.
Meanwhile, on the West Side, things were getting hot at the rehearsal space of the Private Instigators. As usual, the Privates’ guitarist, Dominick, started the conversation.
“Guys, we sound tighter than ever! I’m really happy with how we’re playing! We should record this!” 
“Yeah, we’re really cookin’, man,” Keith, the singer and bassist, chimed in. “Where should we record?”
“Chris Steinmetz from Stonecutter Studios wants to produce us,"" Dominck replied. ""He's worked with so many great artists, like Paul Simon, Miles Davis, B.B. King, Alice In Chains, Smashing Pumpkins, Suicidal Tendencies, Rod Stewart, Mavis Staples, Jay-Z, Rihanna, Madonna, Usher, and even KISS!.”
“Dominick, that’s great! But where would we get the money?” Keith reached into his pocket to illustrate. “I’ve got $5, a cough drop, and a pick. Recording in a different city is going to cost an arm and a leg. Right, Jeff?”
Jeff, the drummer, shrugged. It’s just like him. You put him behind a drumset, and he’s the loudest person for miles. But ask him a question, and you’re lucky to get a word out of the taciturn timekeeper.
Dominick thought for a minute. You could practically see the gears turning, and the light go on behind his eyes.
“Kickstarter! We could raise our budget through Kickstarter!”
Keith nodded. “That sounds like a darn fine idea. Let’s see,” he said, punching numbers into his phone, “First, we’ll need travel expenses including renting a trailer for our gear (which should cost about $15 a day for 12 days, plus insurance), gas to Nashville for recording and Atlanta for mixing and then back home (which is around 1,600 miles!), and hotels and food for all three of us. Add that to studio time for recording, mixing and mastering ($800 a day), artwork, duplication, copyrights, and, since this is Kickstarter, we’ll need to make and send all of our supporters’ rewards. Hmmm.... I’d say that, when you add it to the money we’ve made at our shows so far, we probably need about five gees to make an EP.”
Dominick smiled. “Five grand? Sounds reasonable. But if we get more than that, we can record a full album instead of an EP*. Right, Jeff?”
Jeff shrugged.
At the same moment, in a burnt-down warehouse in Rogers Park, Ronette Penniman spoke to her friends, Crystal and Chiffon Morton. The two sisters listened raptly as Ronette purred out each syllable, soft and low like bare feet on a Persian rug. 
“Gals, we’ve got a lead.” 
Crystal stood up from the pile of ashes she was sifting through.”It’s about time,” she said, dropping the poker she was using to search for clues. She looked at her sister, Chiffon, who was already over by Ronette. 
Ronette was holding a piece of red paper. It was a flyer for something called The Private Instigators. 
“This must have fallen out of their pocket when they burned the warehouse down!” Chiffon guessed. Ronette had her phone out and was already searching these Private Instigators. 
“Well, look at that. They’re going to be only a couple blocks away tonight,” Ronette cooed. 
“It seems there’s three of them.” 
 “Just like us!” Chiffon added. Crystal shot her sister a dirty look. 
 “Can we get to them any earlier than tonight?” 
“It doesn’t seem likely,” Ronette said. “But tonight gives us time to plan. Let’s see... Ooh, the one with the mohawk is pretty cute. Let’s grab him. Crystal, you still have those handcuffs, right?” 
Crystal smiled. 
Later that night, the Privates blasted through their set like a grenade in a water balloon, leaving everyone present excited and soaking wet. The audience shouted, shook, shimmied, and shivered through crowd-pleasers like “You’re A Creep!”, “Don’t You Know My Love Is Free?”, “My Baby”, and “Too Pretty For Prison.” 
After the show, as they were loading the gear back into their van, Ronette approached the Private Instigators. 
“Hi,” she said. 
Keith stepped toward her. She was just his type. She was curvy, pretty, and there was danger behind her smile. 
“Well, hello yourself, sister.” He grinned at her, and they locked eyes. 
“Would you mind coming to meet my friends? I think you’ll like them. They’re sisters.” 
 Keith didn’t look away as he called to Dominick and Jeff. “Guys, I’ll be back in a minute or three.” 
As he turned the corner to see Chiffon and Crystal, his heart sank. Keith could recognize a trap when he saw one. As he turned to walk away, he felt a pinch in his arm. His vision blurred, and he stayed conscious just long enough to realize he’d been drugged. 
When Keith didn’t return from flirting with that fan, Dominick turned to Jeff. 
“Anything to get out of having to load the van,” he laughed. 
Jeff shrugged. 
“I’m going to go get him, okay?” 
Jeff shrugged. 
Dominick walked over to where Ronette had lead Keith, and found no one. A quick look found some of Keith’s picks on the ground and some footprints in the snow. 
 Dominick ran back to Jeff. 
 “Jeff, Keith’s been taken! Shanghaied! Kidnapped! Keithnapped!” 
Jeff rolled his eyes. Leave it to Keith to go chasing after some dame and get grabbed. The irony of that innuendo didn’t escape Jeff, but he didn’t say anything. He simply strolled over to where Keith had disappeared and took a closer look at the scene. 
Nothing escaped him. No detail, however small. He walked back to the van, and got into the driver’s seat. Dominick was already in the passenger’s seat, strapped in, and ready to go. 
“Come on, Jeff! Let’s go rescue Keith from that woman!” 
Jeff shrugged and shifted the van into gear, and they tore off like a band-aid, in search of their stolen singer.

 ABOUT SEQUENTIAL PULP COMICS, LLC:
My name is Michael Hudson, owner of the boutique graphic novel publishing company, Sequential Pulp Comics, LLC. You may know of our books through Dark Horse Comics. We produced the critically acclaimed and commercially successful The Halloween Legion: The Great Goblin Invasion that was on the short list for Stan Lee's Excelsior Awards. We also produced a wonderfully atmospheric The Hound of the Baskervilles and Steve Bryant's Athena Voltaire Compendium that was up for an award in the 2015 Harvey's. However, our biggest successes have been with our licensed Edgar Rice Burroughs' properties, Jungle Tales of Tarzan and At The Earth's Core.
WHERE WE'VE BEEN & WHERE WE'RE GOING
We've recently broken our relationship with Dark Horse Comics in a mutually amicable way to begin the journey of publishing our own books under the Sequential Pulp Comics imprint. Fredric Brown's Martians, Go Home scripted by Martin Powell, illustrated by Lowell Isaac, and lettered by David Hopkins will be the first solo graphic novel. If we are successful in this venture, we have many more projects in the works that we want to bring to you. 
ABOUT THE PROJECT:
Fredric Brown's Martians,Go Home is a 112 page full color graphic novel that has been licensed by the Fredric Brown Estate. It contain an Introduction by legendary science fiction artist, Vincent Di Fate and an Afterword by the equally famous author, Barry N. Malzberg. It also contains a twelve page art gallery by our illustrator, Lowell Isaac.

The book is complete and ready to go to press. It will be solicited in the June edition of Diamond's PREVIEWS catalog. 

THE  DETAILS: 
 At 6.62 x 10.18 inches, the books  will be exactly like the Dark Horse Comics/Sequential Pulp books, printed by the same press used by Marvel and DC, featuring a gloss-lay flat laminated cover with interior pages on 70 lb. coated gloss  paper sewn perfect bound.
SHORT SYNOPSIS:
Martians have invaded Earth! That’s right, real Martians. Seriously. Suddenly, without warning, one billion Little Green Men are everywhere. The Martians are on your street, and in your house, all of them knowing your deepest and darkest secrets. Untouchable as ghosts and obnoxious as hell, their sinister agenda remains a mystery. Perhaps, their plan is simply to drive the entire human race insane, for that is exactly what they’re doing.
From flop house to the White House, no one is above, or below, the torment of the alien invaders. All is lost. Or, is it?
Only our unlikely hero Luke Devereaux, a burnt-out science fiction writer with nothing left to lose, knows how to defeat the Martians…but he has already lost his mind!
You won’t think of alien contact in the same way, ever again.

The Rajasthani Gypsy Caravan aims to promote and preserve the Manganiyar, Langa, Kalbelia, Bhopa (story tellers), Kamad (devotional singers) and Bhat (Puppeters ) communities and their traditions. This is an enormous and ongoing project. The US tour this fall will help them advance these ambitious goals. We are seeking cultural exchange between Rajasthan and USA.
In the creation of this group, the organization has selected prominent and talented folk musicians, instrumentalists and professional Kalbelia (Gypsies) Bhawai, Ghoomar, Teratali and Chari (fire) dancers.The Traditional singing and dancing includes different repertories such as : devotional songs of bordic heros Ramdeo Peer (Saint), Pabuji, Tejaji, Rani Bhatiyani Sarup, Sati Goma, Sati Gunsar (folk Godesses) Kabir, Meera, Sufiyana Muslims (Mystical) songs : Bulle Shah, Shah Latif, Kanwar Bhagat, Moomal-Mahendra, Dhola-Maru, Lailah Majanu, Shasi-Panu (Love Songs).
""(Suva Devi) has been an inspiration for me in my dance for over a decade."" -Katrina Ji
Katrina first met Imamddin Khan online, then two years later finally met him in person during her travels in India. He brought the top Rajasthani musicians to come perform for her, including Suva Devi who is famous for her barrel turns in the film LATCHO DROM. Katrina Ji's love of Rajasthan, and Imam's mission to preserve and share Rajasthani Culture, has resulted in the Rajasthani Gypsy Caravan Tour.
The Tour dates and cities have been selected and final arrangements are being made! But the upfront costs are dear, such as $3,000 alone in travel visa fees.

Tras varios viajes a Montevideo en República Oriental del Uruguay para descubrir mis raíces maternas, tengo la oportunidad de conocer Indios Charrúas, afrodescendientes y exiliados europeos.
Ces échanges me font prendre conscience de la diversité sociale et culturelle de ce pays situé entre le Brésil et l'Argentine. 
Esos intercambios me hacen tomar conciencia de la diversidad social y cultural de ese país situado entre Brasil y Argentina.  
Chaque année en Février en Uruguay est organisé le plus long Carnaval au monde, tous les quartiers de Montevideo sont en effervescence à partir de la Saint Balthazar ( 6 Janvier, Fête des rois ), C'est là que je découvre le Candombe, classé ""patrimoine immatériel de la culture uruguayenne"" par l'UNESCO en 2009.
En Uruguay, cada febrero, se organiza el carnaval más largo del mundo. Todos los barrios de Montevideo están en plena efervescencia a partir de la San Baltasar (6 de enero, día de Reyes Magos). Asi descubro el Candombe, reconocido en 2009 por UNESCO como Patrimonio Cultural Inmaterial de la Humanidad. 
L'idée de ce projet est donc née le plus naturellement du monde, nourrie par ces exceptionnelles rencontres humaines au coeur des quartiers historiques de la tradition du Candombe et des défilés du Carnaval.      
Esa idea de proyecto nace naturalmente, enriquecida por esos encuentros excepcionales en el corazón de los barrios históricos de la tradición del Candombe y de los desfiles de carnaval.

Entre todos aquellos encuentros, uno de los mas significativos fue con el gran percusionista, lutero y fabricante de tambores Fernando “El Lobo” Núñez, en su famoso taller “El Power” en el barrio sur. Es el fundador del legendario e icónico grupo La Calenda en 1992.
En 2003, ses deux enfants avec leurs amis reprirent ce groupe en y ajoutant leurs propres influences et renommèrent celui-ci: La Calenda Beat. Voici leur premier clip.  
En 2003, sus dos hijos y amigos suyos recuperaron el grupo, añadiendo sus propias influencias y renombrandolo La Calenda Beat. Aquí esta su primer vídeoclip.
Ainsi, à travers les vies de personnes proches des tambours, le documentaire met en lumière l'essentiel de cette culture :  La joie d'être ensemble. 
Así, a través la vida de personas y de sus tambores, el documental pone de relieve lo fundamental de esa cultura : la alegría de estar juntos.

192,1293421954,"Haiti: as it dances, not as it stumbles 
 What is Puertos príncipes: temblemos todos? 
Puertos príncipes: temblemos todos is an account of post-quake Haiti that both denounces systemic violence and celebrates its cultural heritage. That is why the book oscillates between investigations on abuse and documenting the nation’s cultural assets. I believe that zeroing in only on the trauma further hurts the subjects we are trying to help, therefore I also focus on the reconstruction, hope and what happens after. 
Part of this journey was achieved thanks to contemporary dance company Ayikodans. Thank you, Ayikodans and director Jeanguy Saintus, for allowing me to travel with you through sound, music and across generations. 
 Why Haiti? 
Haiti has been erased from the map. After the 2010 earthquake, Haiti received an outpour of sympathy and donations. World countries pledged billions. Humanitarian institutions lent a hand. Six years after and over $14 billions later, Haiti still struggles, and the world has forgotten about it. The statistics speak loudly: 7,515 new homes have been built in a country of 10 million people (NYTimes, 2014). Parts of the donations are unaccounted for (The Guardian, 2013). Some dominicans of Haitian descent face deportation (The Guardian, 2013). 
What happens next? 
Puertos príncipes was first published by La secta de los perros in Puerto Rico. I have been fortunate to take it to many universities, even CNN, which is great. What is even better is the messages in Facebook or emails by people touched by Haiti’s stories of courage. As an example, a Venezuelan dancer said he was moved by the Ayikodans dancers who have continued to represent their country worldwide in spite of the nation's difficulties. That is the best I could have hope for when I sat down to write the book five years ago: To show Haiti as it dances, not as it stumbles. 
La Cifra, a prominent publisher in Mexico City, will print the Second edition of the book. It will print 1,000 copies of Puertos príncipes in January of 2017 and has committed to place the book in bookstores and book fairs across Mexico and other Latin American countries, as well as developing a strategic communication campaign to reach different media and a wider audience, furthering the goal to expose Haiti in a different light.

193,390142964,"SYNOPSIS DU FILM: 
Des Acadiens et Acadiennes passionnés de Belle-Ile-en-Mer en France visitent l’Acadie des Provinces maritimes. Nous sommes témoins de leurs expériences alors qu'ils explorent les lieux d’origine ou leurs ancêtres ont véçus, échangeant avec des Acadiens vivant aux Provinces Maritimes, et suivant leur participation au Congrès mondial acadien. Ce grand évènement attire des milliers d’Acadiens de par le monde et démontre notre diversité et notre vitalité.
Comment seront-ils reçus par leurs «cousins» en Acadie? Quels sentiments éprouveront les Bellilois lorsqu’ils verront les lieux en Acadie ou leurs ancêtres ont vécus pendant 150 ans? De quelle façon leur identité acadienne sera renforcée par leur retour en Acadie?
ENGLISH SYNOPSIS: 
Acadian descendants from the island of Belle-Ile-en-Mer in France come to visit Acadie in the Canadian Maritimes Provinces. We witness their experiences of seeing the places where their ancestors lived before being deported, the French Acadians exchanging with Maritime Acadians, and their participation at the World Acadian Congress. This grand event atracts thousands of Acadians of their world diaspora and celebrates the diversity and vitality of the Acadians. 
How will they be received by their Acadian «cousins»? What feelings will they have on visiting their «homeland» and seeing their old lands where their ancestors lived for 150 years before being deported? Finally, will their cultural identity be further strengthened by   coming «home»? 
Un peu d’histoire acadienne
Les français ont fondé l’Acadie en 1604 et pendant 150 ans ils ont acquis une identité unique. Grâce à leur travail sur leurs riches terres agricoles, leur niveau de vie est devenu très elevé. Ils sont fermiers, pêcheurs et marchants. Les Britanniques occupants demandent que les Acadiens signent un Serment d’Allégeance à la monarchie britannique, ce qu’ils refusent, et ils déportent les Acadiens dès 1755 vers les colonies anglo-américaines, en Angleterre et en France. Suite au Traité de Paris de 1763, les Acadiens libérés vont migrer à nombreuses endroits en Acadie et du monde pendant 50 ans pour trouver un endroit paisible où vivre ou dans l’espoir de trouver et réunir leurs familles.
La diaspora mondiale des Acadiens est née. Aujourd'hui, les Acadiens et leurs descendances vivent aux provinces maritimes, mais aussi au Québec, ailleurs au Canada, aux îles Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon, aux États-Unis (en Louisiane, au Texas et au Maine), aux Antilles (en Martinique et à Haïti), en Amérique du Sud (en Guyane française et aux îles Malouines) et en France (dans le Poitou et en Bretagne surtout).
Belle-Ile-en-Mer, située au sud de la Bretagne, est à 5 000 km de distance de l’Acadie. Leurs ancêtres acadiens ont été déportés en Virginie en 1755, refusés, et ensuite envoyés comme prisonniers en Angleterre pendant 8 ans avant d'être libérés et plusieurs s’installent sur cette belle île en France. Malgré les années et la grande distance entre Belle-Île-en-Mer et l’Acadie, c’est une magnifique communauté qui est très fière de son héritage acadien.
Ce film est la suite logique au premier film que j'ai tourné : BELLE-ILE-EN-MER, ÎLE BRETONNE ET ACADIENNE. Ce film a connu un succès mondial et s’est mérité 31 prix aux festivals de films sur cinq continents et est diffusé sur TV5 Monde dans 151 pays. Film non financé par les institutions, j’ai eu une liberté de création pour y permettre un “point de vue acadien” ce qui est sans doute une des raisons de sa réussite. Je souhaite réaliser ce nouveau film en totale liberté créative avec votre aide par ce sociofinancement (crowdfunding) de Kickstarter. - Ensemble, c'est possible! Merci!
Je souhaite faire ce nouveau film pour témoigner des expériences vécues en Acadie lors de la visite des Acadiens et Acadiennes de Belle-Île-en-Mer pour aider à mieux faire connaître l'Acadie et notre diaspora acadienne.  - Le film sera tournée en août prochain pendant le Congrès mondial acadien.
Le monde est devenu un village globale. Et voir des gens d’un même héritage se réunir en revenant à leur « terre promise » sera sans doute une célébration de notre dynamisme mondiale qui va produire un rassemblement chaleureux. Le cinéma permet au public de vivre une expérience de rapprochement entre les gens.

Le réalisateur
Je m'appelle Phil Comeau et je suis un réalisateur et scénariste acadien d'une centaine de productions. Mes films ont rapportés 90 prix aux festivals à travers le monde et ont aidés à faire connaître l'Acadie. 
Amoureux des Acadiens et de notre diaspora, j’ai visité toutes les communautés acadiennes du globe. Du point de vue humanitaire, je suis convaincu que les personnes déplacées, les réfugiés et les immigrants ont besoin d'un lien directe avec leur passé pour continuer de chérir leur patrimoine et demeurés forts comme peuple. 
De toute évidence, je suis toujours troublé par cet acte injustifié de la déportation en 1755 de 75% de mon peuple, provoquant la mort de milliers d'hommes, de femmes et d'enfants. Mais cet acte cruel n'a pas réussi à détruire notre identité et notre culture. Aujourd’hui, dans les Provinces Maritimes, nous sommes trois cents milles Acadiens qui vivent dans notre «patrie» d'origine et nous avons des millions de «cousins» acadiens partout dans le monde. 
J’ai toujours été impressionné par la fierté des Acadiens et Acadiennes de Belle-Ile-en-Mer. Ils ont un quelque chose d'unique et d'inspirant. On ne peut rencontrer un(e) Bellilois(e) sans être touché par leur dignité. Pour certains d'entre eux, ce sera la première fois qu’ils mettent le pied en Acadie. Ce sera des moments touchants.
Ce film est un appel à la célébration de l'esprit de la résilience humaine.
Ce film suivra l’expérience que vont vivre les voyageurs acadiens et acadiennes de Belle-Ile-en-Mer, jeunes et moins jeunes, en échangeant avec les Acadiens qu'ils vont rencontrés en Acadie, dont certains sont devenus des amis lors de voyages précédents. - Voici quelques-uns des beaux personnages du film que j’ai tourné à Belle-Ile il y a deux ans, et que nous reverrons dans ce nouveau film tourné en Acadie :
 Claude Boudreau
Claude habite Dieppe au Nouveau-Brunswick.  Il est le fondateur des “Voyages DiasporAcadie” à Memramcook qui organise des voyages à travers la diaspora acadienne mondiale. Animateur passionné et plein d'humour, il organise ce voyage du “retour” des Acadiens de la France en Acadie. Il adore faire découvrir la diaspora et faire vivre des expériences avec la “grande famille” acadienne. L’ampleur de la diaspora le fascine, les échanges entre les Acadiens de l'Amérique du nord avec la France le passionne, et les débats sur l’identité acadienne l’excite… 
 Maryvonne Le Gac
Maryvonne est présidente de l'association acadienne «Belle-Ile Acadie» depuis plus de 20 ans. Une personne très active dans sa communauté insulaire, elle chérit son patrimoine acadien. Très connaissante de l’histoire acadienne, elle a visitée l’Acadie à quelques reprises et a parcourue la diaspora. Elle possède une perception éclairée de ce que c'est la résilience humaine. Acadienne par sa mère, elle est une personne très passionnée et engagée.
 Baptiste Matel
Baptiste, 35 ans, a récemment découvert son héritage acadien par sa généalogie des familles LeBlanc et Richard. Conseiller municipal de la commune de Sauzon, il est informaticien et magasinier pour la compagnie de transport de marchandises. Avide de recherches sur l’histoire acadienne, il est impliqué dont l’association «Youna» qui collectionne, conserve et fait la promotion des traditions belliloises. Très curieux et sensible, il visitera l’Acadie pour la première fois!
 Hélène Jugeau
Hélène est artiste en dessin et en sculpture. Mère de trois enfants, elle est agente de communications à la Compagnie maritime avec son mari. Elle est d’origine acadienne par ses deux parents, dont sa mère est un Granger. Acadienne au tempérament joyeuse, elle va visiter l’Acadie pour la première fois!
 Marie-Claire Granger
Marie-Claire, 57 ans, est mère de trois enfants. Ancienne directrice du Collège Sainte-Anne à Belle-Île-en-Mer, elle offre des cours sur l’histoire acadienne aux jeunes étudiants. Comme son mari, elle a des origines acadiennes par ses deux parents. Marie-Claire a déjà participé à deux Congrès mondial acadien, et voyagera cette fois avec son mari Michel et ses deux jeunes neveux.

Autres personnages 
Dans le film on verra aussi plusieurs Acadiens et Acadiennes de l'Acadie que nos personnages vont rencontrer lors de leur séjour, et bien sur, des milliers de personnes au Congrès mondial acadien."

I want to pay homage to both my first anime I truly fell in love with as a teen, Blood+ and my love for enamel pins. I would stay up past midnight on Saturday's to catch it on Toonami and I loved all aspects of the series, the characters, the plot and the overall message that you can live the way you always wanted to despite who you were born as and since I was a kid I wanted to be an artist.
Blood+ (Blood Plus) is a manga/ anime series based off Blood, the last vampire where Saya Otonashi awakens from her amnesia after fighting a monster called chiropterans, giant bat like creatures that live of the blood of humans. Later she learns she is destined to be the only one that can kill them. Saya embarks on a journey with her family, allies, and her chevalier Haji, to rid the world of the Chiropteran threat, her twin sister and recover her identity. The course of the journey reveals the background history of the Chiropterans and Saya's past, which extends into the mid-19th century. Over the course of the series, Saya travels across the world from Japan, Vietnam, Russia, France and Finally The United States. The series had four seasons and aired from October 2005 to September 2006.

195,1191911552,"      So What's It About?:
The Blue flame is 4 years in the making, and the final comic from indie label 'Damn Dirty Comics' a 120+ page graphic novel that is set to be our magnum-opus as well as our swansong.
This is the autobiography of Rees Finlay, he makes comics......or at least he used to, following a tragic accident his leg barely works, everyone he ever loved has gone and his passion is lost. He is broken. In his darkest hour a mysterious figure appears before him. She is the blue flame, and she is here to lead Rees on a journey though his memories to show him the painful truths that put him where he is now.
Motivations are questioned and loyalty is tested as she forces him to uncover repressed memories, take responsibility for his actions, and make desiscions that'll change his life forever.
Somewhere between 'Fight Club' and 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind', The Blue Flame explores love, loss, guilt and what it means to battle your demons. 
Why Kickstarter? Why now?
Well, following an unfortunate accident i have been away from the comics scene for just over a year, alot has happened (but if i told you that'd spoil the book) and as a coping mechanism i started drawing sequentials of these events, this grew and grew into what is the 120+ page account of the last 4 years. 
Just like the Rees in the book, it's been an emotional roller-coaster making this book, its not pleasant re-living the past, the good times especially. We're as good as finished making it, now we just need you're help for the book to see release. All my life I've wanted to do something that matters, and with your help it can happen.
Whats in it for you?
Well, apart from your newly discovered enormous sense of joy from knowing how much your support means to me, we also have both digital and print copies of the book up for grabs. We also have original art up for grabs ,aswell as rare books from our back catalogue and t-shirts if your into that sort of gear.
So where does the money go?
The bulk of it will be going into printing the book, a full colour, 120+ page walloper of a book isn't cheap to produce, but it'll be worth it. We also have the t-shirts to produce and postage costs.
We also have 6 guest artists doing pieces throughout the campaign we'll be posting here and printing inside the book, artists include Karl Jones, Tim Conroy, Shunaid Swayers, and Danny Avison. They'll all be paid as well as our wonderfully talented cover artist, Paulette Arochena and our 3 editors. 
 Thank you for reading. And weather you chose to back us or not, have a good one. have the best one. "

The result will be two beautiful coloring books that can be enjoyed, shared or gifted for adults and children alike! Sketchbook Flowers has 72 pages, 35 images, a full color cover, each page is printed one one side only for better coloring. Sketchbook Trees has 58 pages, 28 images, a full color cover, and is also printed one one side only for better coloring. All coloring books and prints will be signed by Herb and can be personalized to that special someone if you like.
By pledging, you will be directly supporting an independent artist and small business. 
Our two new coloring books
These images are from Herb's personal sketchbooks, this is what he does for fun when not working on one of his many illustrations. They are filled with beautiful flowers and trees with few surprises! Herb has always been a great admirer of the natural world and likes to sit quietly sketching when he is out in nature.
These beautiful, highly detailed drawings are for adults and kids to color. We are planning to create an inventory of 250 of each of the coloring books but if we exceed our goal we will be able to give our backers some surprise additional rewards. This is a great way for our supporters and friends to get some special extra rewards for pre-ordering the new coloring books and helping us to produce this wonderful project!
This time we have 8 different rewards with two at the $20 level to give you plenty of affordable choices depending on how much you would like to pledge to support the project. The various reward levels have so much fun stuff including extra coloring books, signed prints, bookmarks and stickers. This will be our 7th and 8th self-produced coloring books and you as a backer will have a chance to purchase not only the new books but also all of the previous coloring books as well. Four of our other coloring books are drawn in the Art Nouveau style with elaborate twisting borders, depictions of flowers, birds, animals and insects...and of course creatures from the worlds of fantasy and myth. Depending on how much you would like to pledge to the project, you can receive two or all of the other coloring books.
From Sketchbook Trees
This Kickstarter campaign will end in mid July and we are planning to have all the rewards sent by the end of August, in plenty of time for Christmas! Those of you who supported our previous projects know that we try to give good updates as the project progresses and that we ship our rewards very quickly upon completion, this time should be no different.
Rewards
Please support Herb's work by pledging to this project. 
The Kickstarter timeline is only 30 days. We estimate that the books will be printed and ready for distribution by late July 2020. Kickstarter participants should receive their copies around the end of July to mid August. These are a great idea for a Christmas or birthday gift for a special friend or for yourself!  
All of the initial funds will go toward the costs of printing and shipping the books and the rewards.
If we exceed our initial goal which will allow us to print the coloring books, we will have additional stretch goals which will be determined as we go if there is enough interest. 
HOW TO PLEDGE:  
Step 1. Decide which Rewards you like, taking note of any shipping estimates.  
Step 2. Create a Kickstarter account, determine payment method. 
 Step 3. If the campaign is successful, in 30 days, your account will be charged and your reward is secured.

What started as one cute little burger has now turned into a full snack pack of 8 pixelated food court friends!
All 8 pins will be produced using a printed hard enamel process. Printed hard enamel pins use the enamel + die-struck process, with the image printed directly onto the enamel. I chose this method to ensure the pixels are captured perfectly! The backs and edges of each pin will be gold plated. Each pin will be between 1” and 1.5”, perfect to rock on your jean jacket or fanny pack when you're hanging with your friends at the food court! And because I know you love extra sauce, I am including a matching vinyl sticker! 
This campaign will last 30 delicious days! Within this window, your pledges can be edited at any time. 
There are 8 total designs waiting to be unlocked! Each design will be unlocked at a different ""stretch goal,"" meaning if the amount of money specified has been raised, the design will be manufactured. You can choose your foodie pin in the backers survey at the end of the campaign.

199,45519724,"Devil Spy is a teenage human animal hybrid who spends his days removing dead bodies from apartments, making his part of the city habitable for his own kind. But the only thing he really wants is to meet a live human being. Fortunately DS gets his wish one day when he stumbles upon a chubby teenager named Wyatt. The two quickly form a strong bond, and set out on a quest to find Wyatt's missing sister.
Devil Spy has a mix of sci fi, post apocalyptic, and adventure elements but it's mostly a story about loyalty and friendship. I started Devil Spy way back in July of 2014 and have been eagerly anticipating a time when I had enough pages to publish a graphic novel. That time is now, but I need your help to do it! Color printing is VERY expensive and I can't afford the cost on my own. I've successfully published two graphic novels previously; Willem and Split Screen, with your support on Kickstarter. I'm hoping you will lend your support again for Devil Spy.
My plan for the book:
A paperback book printed in full color. The webcomic pages are 6""x9"" and the book will likely be the same size as my previous 2 books (6.5""x9.25""). The book will collect chapters 1-6 of the Devil Spy series and will include the 10 page prologue. There are seven chapter title pages and I'm planning to include a Q & A section, fan art, concept sketches and some series fun facts. I estimate the book will be around 105 pages.
Devil Spy is a series that is near and dear to my heart. I love Devil Spy and Wyatt so much and I really want to see this book become a reality!

200,1063831694,"I started making these snowflakes, sort-of compulsively, last Christmas after my Dad died of cancer.  I think it became something I could do with my hands that helped me sit with my feelings.  I had a bunch of old 1950's/1960's Playboy and National Geographic magazines, and I really liked the feel of the paper, the vintage graphics, and the chance ways the images became altered when cut and unfolded into snowflakes.
Well, it's almost August, and I haven't stopped making them...even if a day feels particularly sad, I feel okay if I've made something beautiful. So I make snowflakes.  And I want to keep on making them, especially since so many of my friends and acquaintances love them, too. 
I bought a small laminating machine for $20 and matte laminating pouches (which are much more expensive!) because the snowflakes are very special, and I want to preserve them.  A pack of 100 matte laminating sheets costs $73.95 (plus shipping), and I'm close to running out of the pack that I bought back in January.  Oregon Laminations has the best prices for matte laminate pouches large enough to fit my snowflakes.  I also need to buy more vintage issues of National Geographic and Playboy Magazine on Ebay in order to have more material to work with.  The Playboys average about $7 per issue at 6-7 issues per stack, so I'd end up spending roughly $45 - $50 (plus shipping) for an order of seven Playboy magazines; here's an example.  The National Geographic magazines cost a little bit less (about $2-$4 per issue when bought in a stack of twelve), so an order would cost me on average $42; here's an example.
Many friends have encouraged me to keep making these because they're gorgeous, delightfully irreverent, one-of-a-kind art objects.  They're durable because of the fine, matte laminate (which I hand-cut by Xacto and swivel-blade), and they hang invisibly with clear fishing-line.  I've been thinking that another way to present and preserve the artwork would be with clear glass, double-sided picture frames that could stand alone or be hung in a window. I've researched framing options, and it looks like each frame would cost about $15 (plus shipping), from either Amazon or B&H Photo.
In either case, I've made so many already, and it would be wonderful to present them at Brooklyn Flea ($275/booth) and/or the Renegade Craft Fair ($500/booth) this holiday season.  It would be so nice to continue and further what's been a very beautiful and rewarding project for me this year.  "
201,224613880,"If the project hits 200% funding, I'll add a holographic sticker featuring new Inkholm artwork to every reward for free!
Inkholm
Inkholm is a series of 31 illustrations of imagined landscapes, hand drawn in ink on paper, then cut out and layered onto a coloured ink background. Each piece explores some fantasy or sci-fi world, from quiet secluded cottages to vast sprawling cityscapes, with a few more unusual places in there too, all lovingly hand crafted in minute detail on an 8"" square of paper.
Inktober
Inkholm was created in October 2018 as part of Inktober, a worldwide challenge to artists of all kinds to create with ink every day for an entire month. I chose to follow the official prompts, creating a new landscape each day inspired by the single word suggestions. It was the second time I'd done a daily art challenge, and the first time I'd really got to grips with working in ink, helping me overcome my fear of making a mistake. Working in ink means no rubbing out, so no second chances. Since doing Inktober last year, I've become obsessed with the medium, and working in ink has become one of my favourite ways to create.
I've fallen so in love with ink, I'll be taking part in Inktober again this year, with a different concept. To follow that, and keep up to date with my work, check out my Twitter or Instagram!
The Rewards
So what can you get for backing the project?
At the first reward tier, you can grab a set of 5 mini-prints of some of my favourite pieces from Inkholm. Each one is picked because it had a concept I loved, took particular skill to create, or was simply great fun to do. The prints will be 12cm (~ 5"") squares printed in full colour on thick paper with a matte finish. They'll be perfect for framing, or display as they come.
At the second tier, you can grab a copy of the Inkholm art book. It's a 7.5"" square coffee table book with all 31 pieces, some background information on the the project and Inktober, and even some extra photos of my design process included.
The third tier lets you grab both the book and the mini-print set at a discount!
And the fourth tier will get you your very own custom original artwork. You'll get to commission an Inkholm scene of your own, and get the original artwork ready for framing, or display as is. Each piece is 8"" square, and hand drawn on 2 layers of 250gsm white card. You can give me an idea for what you'd like me to create, or leave it up to me for a total surprise!
Estragon Helmer
I'm an indie artist working in traditional and digital media. I've  recently been going all in on ink, with new projects like this one. I love sci-fi and fantasy, and have lately had a strong theme with spaceships and robots in my illustration. Alongside art, I also craft handmade products, and even build video games!

202,533822477,"THE STORY
Without giving to much away on the plot of the story or any spoilers, the film starts off with The Joker in a gritty abandoned nightclub set 4 years after the events of when he was in Arkham Asylum and first met Harley Quinn. He is trying to track down Harley Quinn after he finds out a Hijack went wrong and Batman captured Harley Quinn. We will also have some flashback scenes which will feature a 10 minute scene of how The Joker met Harley Quinn in Arkham and show you how she fell in love with The Joker. We will also see a few flashback scenes of why The Joker became the person you all know and love today. Without spoiling anymore or giving away too much there's going to be some amazing Easter Eggs within the film especially ""The Killing Joke""
This film is made by the fans for the fans. I have had this idea going through my head for a while now and decided to sit down write the script and make this finally happen. The film will take a very different approach towards creating the characters The Joker and Harley Quinn, but the overall characters will stay true to the comics. The overall looks of Harley Quinn have been tweaked a bit but she will have her famous red and black look for her costume. The Joker will have a more classic look to him with a unique outfit but he will wear various outfits through the course of the film.
The Reason I am raising funds for this fan film are as follows:
Make Up 
Props 
Outfits 
Music 
Every penny counts so all the help is appreciated by the cast and crew! if we get backing more than the set goal then more will be filmed and will increase the quality of the film and special effects and maybe we might be able to add in a few more Batman villians in the film with extra funding than the goal set out. 
The video for this fund raiser is a TEST shot just to show you what it will be like, it's not a final shot just promotional for this fundraiser. "

My goal is to complete my debut album.  I set my goal extremely low because I'm determined to complete my CD.  That being said, the more backing I get, the sooner I can complete my project.  I write, play all of the instruments, and provide all of the vocals on my songs. I also made a video for ""Louisiana Sweat"" for youtube which has been viewed by my fans in multiple countries. My original music is a mixture of rock, blues, and Louisiana roots music. Visit my website at www.BradDisonBand.com. ""Louisiana Sweat"" is receiving airplay and many of my fans are requesting a CD of my music. I've written and have demos of the rest of the songs on the album but lack sufficient funds to pay the expensive production fees. Two of my songs, ""Louisiana Sweat,"" and ""Bump in the Road,"" are complete and are available to preview and download on iTunes, Amazon.com, and CD Baby. I'm determined to complete this album and welcome you to my project. 
Together, we can complete this project.  You can even be in one of my videos.  It will be a lot of fun and will be something you can be proud to sponsor.  Thank you.

a new book by Brian Gruber and Adam Edwards
The American Constitution was revolutionary and inspired the world because it put citizens in charge with a specific blueprint for how to keep aristocrats, autocrats, and chaos at bay. We are at an extraordinary moment when Americans from every part of the political spectrum feel abandoned and disaffected, the system paralyzed and corrupted.
It wasn’t always this way. Throughout our history, everyday Americans organized and effectively moved the needle on big ideas and causes that mattered. Executive producer Adam Edwards and acclaimed author Brian Gruber are partnering to explore why that is no longer the case, what we can learn from history, and how citizens can engage in 2019 to move mountains. 
We believe our current challenges are surmountable as those came before us faced much greater odds and won -- from the women’s suffrage and civil rights movements to the single person responsible for the most recent Constitutional amendment to the Bonus Army veterans who helped swing the 1932 election to see justice served.
We have plenty of history books. We need a playbook. Adam is funding the writing process, but we are looking for your help to fund the travel, production, and other elements to deliver an important new book and big impact. We will harvest fresh narratives from witnesses to history, family members, key stakeholders, thought leaders, those behind the scenes who solved the logistics, and those who imagined the big ideas that moved the country.
Our goal is to understand how they surmounted seemingly impossible obstacles and how they brought the vision of the country’s founders alive. And, depending on the funds raised, we will travel to the scenes of historic global protests from Berlin to Tunis to Seoul to mine provocative stories for models and lessons learned. 
Adam Monier Edwards is an online marketer with 20 years of experience working with household names, now managing a team of nearly 50 digital experts at one of the world's top four advertising agencies. He has spoken at numerous conferences including Voice.ai, Search Marketing Expo (SMX) Advanced, and Yext Onward. Adam has been the executive producer on multiple films which have premiered at prestigious festivals such as Tribeca and DOC NYC. His experience on the board of Upwardly Global helped him understand that challenges are not always overcome easily but are indeed surmountable. The events he hosted for the non-profit, including a previously successful Kickstarter campaign, received press coverage in both the New York Times and New York Daily News. In his spare time, Adam is an avid crowdfunder, having backed nearly 300 Kickstarter projects.
Brian Gruber was the first director of marketing at C-SPAN where he hosted call-in shows with politically prominent guests such as Cesar Chavez, John McCain, and Nancy Pelosi. He founded and led FORA.tv, the world’s premiere thought leader video network, selected by TIME as one of the 50 best sites on the web, and livestreaming jazz network ShowGo.tv. Brian is a three-time author including the Kickstarter-funded “War: The Afterparty,” for which he traveled around the world to the scenes of a half century of U.S. military interventions to evaluate the human and economic costs of war from both ends of the gun barrel. His most recent book “Six Days at Ronnie Scott’s: Billy Cobham on Jazz Fusion and the Act of Creation” has garnered rave reviews from the world’s leading jazz, percussion, and music publications.

Hi Everyone,
    I am just a student who dreams to have my photobook be seen by everyone around the world. I will be photographing people and interview them with an interesting topic. 
An old man at Mount Bromo
     This year, I will be visiting Indonesia, Thailand and Taiwan for my December trip. My trip is more than just street photography because I am planning to do community services at the same time to understand the lifestyle of the people and get a better idea of their lifestyle before photographing them. My itinerary is being planned by my contact in the country itself.
----------------------------------------------------
12-17 December 2016, Malang, Indonesia:
Mount Bromo
I will be going to Mount Bromo which I had also visited last time but only able to spend a day there. I have seen a lot of people trying to earn their living with just renting out their horses for 10$SGD and they have to walk a few kilometre up and down hill with the person who rented the horse. Hence, I want to revisit the location to help out the local to improve their standard of living as well as increase their income if possible.
Horse Rental
**18 December 2016 - 2 Jan 2017, Bangkok, Thailand:
Thailand has just lost the King who had always been like a Father to them. There will be a lot of people going to the palace, queueing to show condolences to the late King. However, some people take advantage of this sad incident to make a business by raising the price of the essential things the people need for example, black t-shirt (used to be 2-4$ and now easily 20$), food and drinks. There are also people who could not afford to make their way down to Bangkok to say good-bye to the late King. Hence, I am planning to actually do a small documentary to see how the people feeling about all these after three months since the King has passed away.
**I will be spending in total around a week in Bangkok as I will be flying to Taiwan from Bangkok as it is cheaper than flying straight from either Singapore or Indonesia. 
A friendly hotdog seller
20-27 December 2016, Kaohsiung, Taiwan:
Taiwan has been affected by Typhoon for very long time due to the geographic location. However, the recent typhoon I had seen through photographs shared by my friends was horrible. I am planning to go to Kaohsiung and nearby city to see those people who are affected and could not afford to repair their house and pay hospital bills. I will be at the same time helping them to repair their home and photograph them. Furthermore, I am giving a free wedding photoshoot to a couple who cannot afford their dream pre-wedding shoot.
----------------------------------------------------
    This is my itinerary for the trip to help people and frame them up. I believe in understanding them first, before actually photograph them because we could be smiling and something might be killing us inside.

206,1249729140,"The Story
 “I Have Something to Tell You,"" Adrain Chesser's biographical photo series, captures his loved one's reactions seconds after revealing to them he was HIV positive. Although the series was shot more than a decade ago, it has recently reached a much wider audience, having been picked up by sites like The Huffington Post, beautifuldecay.com,  among others. Adrain also gave a TED talk on the series and the events in his life that inspired it. In Adrain’s words, “I Have Something to Tell You” helped him overcome his childhood fear of abandonment by transforming the emotions that were stirring inside him into art. Adrain has always used photography as a way to better understand and interpret his life. ""I Have Something to Tell You,""  is not just a photo series, it is an exploration of one artist's journey towards healing.
    In this short documentary, our vision is to not only share Adrain’s story in a cinematic way, but also to explore this notion of art as healing for the artist -- as a way of transforming emotions inside ourselves. We have already shot for one weekend with Adrain in his hometown. While there we captured some great b-roll and also several walking interviews. 
The Journey
We are now on to the final step of the production process and we need your help to see the project through. A majority of the film's content will be shot at Adrain's studio and home in Portland, OR. We came to Kickstarter to help fund this leg of the journey. Our expenses include transportation, lodging, food for the crew, equipment rental, insurance, music licensing, and film festival submission fees.  
The Team
We are a group of filmmakers from the Savannah College of Art & Design. We have spent the last several years cutting our teeth by making films together. 'I Have Something To Tell You"" is a passion project of ours and a story that we really believe can positively impact people. But we can't do it alone. 
Dumaine Babcock // Director
Ben Joyner // Director of Photography, Producer
Zack Hetlage // Producer
Taylor MacDonald // Editor
The Rewards
In addition to an HD digital download of the completed film, a private link to our Kickstarter video blooper reel, and other digital rewards, we're also offering some signed copies of Adrain's work.
The first comes at a contribution of $250. It is a signed print from Adrain's series, ""Orange Blossoms, Fire Ants, and the Tyranny of Memory."" We have three different options available below.
The next reward at $500 is a signed copy of Adrain's book, THE RETURN. The work is about a group of people who are living nomadically. They travel with the seasons on what was referred to by first nations people as the “hoop”. Their idea is to live wild and free, untethered from society, to thrive by utilizing traditional hunter gatherer skills. The book itself was also accompanied by a kickstarter, which was successfully funded in December of 2013.

207,2130531067," Puc the Artist is set in a world where everything that exists, is drawn into existence. If you want a birthday cake, just master your pencil work, and draw yourself a birthday cake. Some are skilled at watercolor, some with charcoal or etchings. Each has their own unique ability to create...or destroy. But in this world of ink and artists something important and vibrant has been lost and forgotten - Color. Our story is about the happenstances of discovering it, and the problems three youths must deal with to return it to the world.  
Puc the Artist is a story about friendship, learning one's place in the grand scheme of things, and adventure. The story is planned with a complete beginning, middle, and end. This book will be the begging of the adventure. Just like how Star Wars: A New Hope, stand on it's own as a film. So too will the first Puc The Artist book. If we are so lucky to have the support, the story has room to expand into the other two arcs in the future.  
Garret and I are co-creating this story, so the same art team and writer will be on it the whole way threw. It's a labor of love for the both of us, with Garret being the originator of the character designs and look of this world. And Miles Greb plotting out the story and fleshing out the characters. 
The main book will be 66 pages, a hearty start to the story, and half of the first arch. However if you look below we have a REALLY great stretch goal in mind. 
If we reach the goal of $12,000 everyone getting a Puc The Artist comic will get an upgraded copy. Instead of printing the 66 page large size ""Floppy"" comic, we will instead be printing a graphic novel that is the full first arch of the story. I hope we can do this, as it gives everyone more for their money, and we get to tell the whole first arch with just one Kickstarter and with one book! So please be sure to share it around to help us reach this goal!

 An Orphan from the nomadic tribes of the Cold North. Separated from her family at a very young age Asta has had to learn to fend for herself. She has a quick temper, and picks fights with about everyone. Although some people in town think she is a bit cold, her close friends Tolo and Puc know she would do anything to protect them. She secretly wants to be a start her own Strawberry farm...but she won't ever tell anyone cause she has to keep up appearances.   
 Tolo is a son of a famous explorer and a famous artist. He grew up with stories of far off places from his mother, and watching his father paint images of them. His dream though, was to help others explore the world like his mother so Tolo became a Cartographer. Well, he is training to be one at-least. He carries with him a giant compass that can read the land, but also in a pinch move the ground before him.   
Well read, and more formally educated then his two friends, Tolo is normally the plan maker of the gang. 
 Puc spends his day at his drawing desk in his granddads basement. Introverted by nature, Puc has a good heart and often gets dragged outside by his friends. Even when they do get him to leave his drawing desk, he normally finds something to draw while out and about.  
 He is a Rat Burglar, pun intended. He makes his coin by bounty hunting, in turning in people for petite crimes. He travels with his ally Fink, a husky Mouse who is't the most sophiscated - but he is loyal.   
Read the first issue for free!
       Or if you just want a quick look at the art, here are two pages from the first story arch. Note some of the book will be in Black and White and some in color - it all depends on the story line and what powers Puc can learn!  
The Book!  
A beautiful printed comic book! This is actual a sample of a very small print run I did to show the first arch of the story off at C2E2. The actual book will be longer, and have a different cover. It will be printed by Print Ninja, who is one of the best is the bussiness.   
The book is designed to be 66 pages, and if we hit out strech goal it will increase to 122! 
The Actual Cover below.

Sketch Cover  
 We are making a story about artists after all so what better reward then a sketch cover? These covers will be coated with a nice paper suited for inking. We wanted to make something of an event of them so, everyone who gets one and does a sketch will have their work shown off! We will be tweeting them out, sharing them on Instagram, and Kickstarter updates. Anyone who wants to their art to be linked back to their account, we will be happy to do that.   
Or you can buy it and keep your sketch all to yourself, that is totally fine too! 
There is even an option to have Garret draw a custom sketch for you! 
These covers will be Kickstarter exclusive.

210,1942440455,"Have you ever attended a wedding ceremony and reception? I mean not just any wedding but a good wedding! Do you remember how much fun it was to dress up, meet new people, witness love, and still have an amazing time. Or maybe you're like several people apart of this new growing trend that has never been invited to a wedding as an adult, let alone be a part of one. 
The Fake Wedding Experience is the solution to this problem.
The fake wedding experience will take place September 1, 2018. The fake wedding experience will offer everything a real wedding has to offer with the exception of ""REEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLL LOOVVVVVEEE"". What is real love anyways? Who knows, and who cares? Not every guest at your wedding. Believe it or not most people go to weddings just for the food, the party, the show, to meet new people, and the experience. Thats is everything the Fake Wedding Experience will offer to its guest. 
The Wedding Program 
When the guest arrive they will be greeted and given a wedding program as if they where actually coming to a classy upscale wedding. When the guest walk in they will walk in to a light reception that is going on almost like a meet and greet. The ceremony will start 45 minutes into the event once everyone has arrived. 
The Ceremony 
The event will have a very dramatic ceremony with a twist. Since it is a fake wedding I think it is only right for it to have a theatrical side to it. One way this theatrical side will be highlighted will be in the wedding party. Everyone a part of the wedding party will be random people that have never met before. For example the best man, and the groomsmen, the maid of honor, and brides maid, even down to the parents of the bride and groom.  
When I market the event I will market it stating the first 50 people to purchase tickets will qualify to have a role in the wedding. 
The more serious roles like the groom, bride, and priest will be held by actual actors just for the sake of the show going as comically smooth as possible.
While the ceremony is happening there will be a plot twist, for example the groom may never show up and the bride marries the priest or maybe the maid of honor is in love with the groom and she speaks up about her feelings at the alter. The married couple will be presented (Whoever ends up getting married)So many potential plot twist just to keep it funny and fun.
After the ceremony the actual reception will start and there will be a bride and groom first dance, a toast and speech by the best man and maid of honor, cake cutting, father daughter dance, mother son dance, more partying and of course no wedding is complete without the garter and bouquet toss. (Each one will  have a twist in some way) 
This amazing event will offer every single thing any other wedding has to offer except ""REEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLL LOOVVVVVEEE""
What will the funds go towards?
 $2,000 will go towards the venues that it is in the center of downtown Little Rock, Arkansas 
$ 2,000 will go towards the experience dj that has hosted over 3000 events in his career. 
$ 1,500 will go towards marketing; Flyers, Social Media Advertisements, and Radio Advertisement. If we exceed the desired goal then I am hoping to lease a billboard. 
$ 1,500 will go towards decorations for the event.
There are other things that will need funded that I plan on funding out of pocket and as we continue to sell tickets  for example. Drinks, food, photographer, and photo booth with fun props.
P.S. 
Link to part of where I got the idea from

https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mvkq4y/fake-weddings-argentina
You monetize by selling tickets. $35 a ticket with open bar. Everyone will pay to attend an event like this. Reinvest the proceeds, have another event, and build a brand. Eventually license it out(thats the long goal). Or simply travel the US and host one every other month or so. Business created! Nothing is simple but definitely POSSIBLE. AND A PROVEN BUSINESS MODEL MAKES IT EVEN BETTER. "

212,107548254,"The Project
The Last Incantation is an independent short film (approximately 20 minutes long) based on the short story by Clark Ashton Smith. The film has been shot but we are looking for post-production funds to finish the film and submit the film to film festivals and other venues. With your help, we hope that The Last Incantation will be the first in a whole line of Weird Tale and Cosmic Horror film adaptations.
Background
Andrew Migliore, after sitting on his script for over 10 years, felt it was high time that the rich bounty of Clark Ashton Smith's work be brought to the screen. Woodruff Laputka, having read the script, said, ""We can totally do this!"" The rest as we say is history.
The Last Incantation is a short story about Malygris, a necromancer, who has learned all that there is to learn, having mastered all occult lore, all forbidden knowledge, and having dominion over the spirits of earth and sea and air... and the living and the dead. But there is still one lesson he has yet to learn with the last incantation.
Our many thanks goes out to author Scott Connors and the Clark Ashton Smith Estate for supporting this project.
Malygris (played by actor Brian Hutton) calling forth Nylissa.
The Unforgotten Author
Clark Ashton Smith was a poet, sculptor, painter and author of fantasy, horror and science fiction who was one of the major contributors to the golden age of Weird Tales magazine in the late 1920s through the late 1930s. He was in good company with Robert E. Howard and H.P. Lovecraft.
Getting advice from a daemon familiar is always a tricky proposition.
 “As for the problem of phantasy, my own standpoint is that there is absolutely no justification for literature unless it serves to release the imagination from the bounds of every-day life.” — Clark Ashton Smith
The Team
pictured: Woodruff Laputka (director), Tehben Dean (cinematographer), Andrew Migliore (writer/producer), Rob Taylor (art director & production designer).
 Producer Andrew Migliore is no stranger to film having created and produced the DVDs for the H.P. Lovecraft Collection vol. 1-5, the Edgar Allan Poe Collection, and the Weird Tale Collection at Lurker Films. He was also the founder and original director of both the H.P. Lovecraft Film Festival   and Zompire The Undead Film Festival.
Andrew in the garage with the highly detailed and well-crafted plan to build the stage set pieces.
Tehben and Woodruff on the set.
 Director Woodruff Laputka and cinematographer Tehben Dean have taken their passion for storytelling and traveled across the world capturing both the beauty and the struggle of humanity's experience. Collectively their portfolios encompass hundreds of documentaries, music videos and short films along with countless branded video content for companies including:  National Geographic, Nike, Adidas, AirBnB, BBC, Discovery Channel, CNN, Atlas Obscura, Al Jazeera, LG, Monster Energy, MSNBC, Redbull, TLC, and The Smithsonian Institute. Watch their film reel here:
Rob Taylor has worked on dozens of films but is perhaps best remembered for directing his labor of love Neil Stryker and the Tyrant of Time, a damn clever and snarky homage to every 80's action flick ever made. But when it comes to building props, Rob is the man to rely on as he is a miracle worker when it comes to using power tools and a hot gun.

My name is Francisco Herrera, I've been working in the entertainment business as an Artist for more than 20 years jumping from Style Guides for Consumer Products to Comic Books, Character Design, Toys and Manufacture all the way to Art Direction for 3D and Life Size figures for Them Parks and Resorts.

Around 14 years ago I start publishing art books about my stuff, working progress, sketches etc… so far around 10 books already out since then, but it’s been a while without any new books, working it's been crazy and a lot of material in my hands from the last years and RETROBOX is the best excuse to bring all this to life with KICKSTARTER.

214,857136022,"I am thrilled to welcome you to my first Kickstarter campaign to bring my book to life!  
I need your support for my dream to come true to help save the arts and provide visual literacy in the 21st Century!
Why?
Visual literacy is:
understanding what you see
a form of critical thinking
what it means to be literate in the digital age
It is more important than ever before that we have this ability.   Consider how technology continues to give us more ways to communicate and evoke emotion using images.  
The paradox is, that the revolution in visual communication is happening at a time of drastic cuts to the Arts and Arts Education.   
The book, Art For All Ages, is my response to this paradox.  
Why this book?   Why now?
Because making art in the way presented in this book, is a real path for anyone to become confident and knowledgeable in discussing and making visual decisions.   
Help me get my book, Art For All Ages, out to the world!  I need your support!
To help cover:
Quality color printing
Graphic design formatting
Proofreading costs
Copyright of famous museum artists
The goal for publication of this book is ambitious.   With your help, though, I know we can make it happen!
The activities within Art For All Ages are designed to be interactive and multi-generational, with experiences that can be shared with young and old, siblings, support groups, best friends, children with parents and grandparents, couples, and adult friends.
While each activity can be done alone, the full benefit emerges within an interactive group.  How better to reach as wide an audience as possible?
Three Generations, AKA ""3 gens""
From the book...
Making visual decisions is an increasingly valuable skill.   Yet so many of us are stuck in the the belief that we are not creative.   
""I'm not an artist.  I can't even draw a stick figure.""  
Have you ever had such thoughts?   Throughout my 35 years of teaching, I've heard similar frustrations from young students and high school athletes to my 71 year old neighbor, attorneys and others at art gatherings in my studio.   All were initially held back by preconceived notions of what their art ""should"" look like. 
""Every child is an artist.  The problem is staying an artist when you grow up.""                              - Pablo Picasso
An everyday miracle is available within these pages.   Just as exercise physically activates endorphins that reduce stress and make us feel great, making art, as presented, can produce a similar experience that I call, ""Pizzazz of the Heart."" 
Self Discovery
Where are you now?
By now you can see that this is not just another art book!   Art For All Ages is truly a hybrid of genres:
 Art History:   Art history is an important component within this book.  However, Art For All Ages is more than just a survey of finished art or bodies of work.  Few books on art history teach the art process; none guide the artist's experience. 
 Art Therapy: I am passionate about nurturing the artists' experience: an energized focus, feelings of reconnection and centeredness that are, above all, therapeutic.    
 How-to Art Instruction: Art For All Ages is a visual step by step rendering of how to create quality art.   The book's focus on the artist's experience is unique.   It differs in other ways as well.   For example, Art For All Ages DOES NOT in any way resemble a paint by number book as do many in the ""how-to"" genre.  
 New Age - Self Discovery: The meditative states cultivated in Art For All Ages are addressed in some ""new age"" books, with a key difference: Art For All Ages is easily accessible and fun!
 Coffee Table Book: Best of all, Art For All Ages is a beautiful, color-printed book filled with original artwork by me, my former students and great renowned fine artists.   It can be on display or shared as a wonderful gift!
 Art For All Ages is organized into three mutually integrated parts as follows:
Recipes for Success
The activity lessons in Art For All Ages are time-tested -- selected from the visual curriculum that I developed over 35 years teaching arts in public schools and privately to adults and multi-generational groups.    Art history is an important component, seamlessly woven into the activity lessons. 
Essential Ingredients
Each recipe calls for its own Essential Ingredients, one or more art skills that you will use to complete the recipe's activity.  Adults (or adults with children) can dive into the book at any point to find inspiration, choose activities, and acquire skills in easily accessible ways.
Sample pages from the book
Self-discovery Vignettes
Self-discovery pieces are scattered throughout, such as ""The Art of Aging"" and ""The Universal Age of Symbols.""  Some are fact-based, like ""Harmony of the Brain,"" which invites you to the awareness that you are inherently creative and artistic.  Others are more inspirational, like ""Mindfulness, Meditation, and Art,"" which describes the feelings and focus of reconnection that you can experience while you are making art.  
This is the only book that provides exceptional, how-to instruction while also nurturing and guiding the wholistic experiences available to anyone making art in the way presented.   

About the Author
Art For All Ages author, Corinne Miller Schaff (AKA, Mrs. Art) taught art for over 35 years in the public schools primarily in Irvine Unified School District.   With both an undergrad (Indiana University) and a masters degree (Stanford University) in Art Education, she is highly qualified to pay forward her passion for the artistic process by offering experiences, skills and techniques.   
Cori is also a juried artist whose work is found in galleries, homes and businesses throughout the country.   Her commitment is to make the transformative artist experience - the Pizzazz of the Heart - an everyday miracle for students of all ages. 
Why I need your support:
Printing and development costs for this book have been substantial.   I have funded approximately a third of the project to date including a designer's fee to format the book, professional proofreader fees to perfect the editing, and securing copywriting and digital fees.  I need help to get the book printed and distributed.  I need your Kickstarter support to make this a reality.
Any overage contribution from the campaign goal will be used for additional printings.  I intend to reach out to schools for book signings and contribute a percentage of the profits in support of art education programs!
In return for supporting my cause, please check out the various rewards as my gift to you. See more at Corinne Designs.

218,550619736,"The Quad Traverse (that's a working title, by the way) will be a documentary film about three regular guys trying to do something nobody's ever done before: ascend and descend New Hampshire's Mount Washington four times from four different directions in twenty-four hours...in winter.

Specifically, the film will cover three Maine residents and definitely-not-professional mountaineers, Charlie, Rick, and Barrett, as they attempt to prepare physically and mentally for the biggest athletic challenge, and possibly the biggest psychological challenge, of their lives. They'll face extreme cold, high winds, night climbing, and a course that'll see them cover 29 miles and ascend more than 15,000 feet. That's (roughly) like moving a marathon distance while covering the elevation gain of Mount Everest (base camp to summit), all on a mountain that's famous for having the worst weather on earth. 

We're aiming for a runtime of around 30 minutes. Sounds awesome, right? Then help us make it happen and we'll give you some cool stuff in return!
      For full details on all of the available rewards, check the column on the right side of the screen → → →
  I'm Charlie, one of the three guys attempting this crazy climb, and I'll be directing the film. I'm an experienced editor, videographer, and animator. I previously wrote, produced, directed, and edited the feature-length documentary Living with Dead Hearts. It was pretty well-received, but that was also way back in 2013. I've learned a ton in the years since, and I'm confident this film is going to be even better.
We're financing the climb ourselves, and I have most of the software and equipment needed to make the film, so we don't need much. We're aiming for $1,500, which would help us cover a couple additional necessary pieces of equipment (lenses and lights). Anything beyond that is gravy, and will be put towards improving the quality of the film!

Note: Kickstarter is all or nothing. If we don't make that $1,500, we get $0.
Well, aside from showing it to all of our lovely backers, our hope is to get it into adventure and mountain film festivals across the country and across the world. We plan to donate any profits the film* makes to environmental nonprofit organizations. Our goal here isn't making money, it's telling a story about how it's possible to achieve a lofty athletic goal, even if you - like us - aren't a pro, but just a weekend warrior with a dream. 
* Note: This is our plan, but it's not part of this Kickstarter campaign, as Kickstarter doesn't allow accepting donations for charity. If you choose to donate to this campaign, your money will go towards helping us make this film a reality. Your donation to this film is not tax deductible."
219,455048556,"Like many of us, I use Facebook as a conglomerate of news sites so that I can get a breadth of perspectives as I develop my opinions. 
Given the growing distrust of news sites in the U.S., I have been searching for a site that would present multiple news stories side-by-side, for my to do a direct comparison on how stories are being reported. 
This stems from an experience with two major news sites last winter: 
1. Fox News reported a front page story about a man who was targeted for having a ""Blue Lives Matter"" bumper sticker. His truck was vandalized -- the culprits spray-painted ""Black Lives Matter"" on his truck, smashed the windows, broke lights... 
KICKER: When I cross-checked this story on CNN's site, it was nowhere to be found! 
2. A couple days later, CNN reported a front page story about a man who was caught by police trying to cash in on the ""Black Lives Matter"" movement when he could no longer afford his truck payments, so he vandalized his truck himself in an attempt to collect insurance (apparently the truck owner went back and did more damage to his truck after CSI took their initial crime scene photographs)! 
KICKER: When I cross-checked this story on Fox News' site, it was nowhere to be found! 
Out of this the idea for a comparative news site was born. I have researched legalities around streaming news sources. Legally, a ""news aggregator"" like this passes the 'fair use' test because the site is ""transformative"" in nature (see Perfect 10, Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc.). 
There is nobody doing a site like this!! Let's get it up and running so that the PEOPLE can form their own opinions through the muck of biased reporting! I have purchased a URL for the site: uDecideNews.com. Now we need to get working on the design of the site itself!
I want to build in algorithms for streaming top stories based on trending hashtags (#'s) or keywords, allowing the user to select various news icons on a sidebar, enter a search term and be presented with all stories related to that keyword coming from the news outlets selected. 
Let's make a platform for comparative news stories!! "

221,1144806801,"Why an artist residency?
The residency at GlogauAIR would give me the opportunity to work within a new space and culture and interact with different people and their ideas to extend my own thoughts and practice. The three months would give me the opportunity to focus on my process and work through some ideas I have been thinking about as well as simply reacting to a new space. 
As I am very interested in our relationship with spaces and create very site specific work, I am dependant on having new places to react to in order to make work, making residencies a very important structure for my practice. While this residency is unfunded, beginning with a residency such as this will be an important stepping stone to me being able to make a living for myself as a practising artist.
Artist Statement
My work explores the physical experience of architecture; looking at the way individuals as bodies move about spaces in order to investigate the three-way relationship between body, space and work. I am particularly interested in the spaces we don’t usually look at, use or think about, for instance the ceiling and spaces above our heads. Through my work I look at breaking the habits people have within architectural spaces to alter the way they move about or look at the space. Rather than setting up internal relationships within the work and creating my own spaces, I seek to alter the existing space by creating a relationship between the work and the architecture. 
Recently I have been working by installing columns into spaces. These works transcend objectness, sculpture and installation to become part of the architecture, dictating the way in which the space is used without the viewer realising. It is important that these interventions are not directly looked at except in the way the existing walls, floor and ceiling are as the work becomes the relationship between the columns and the existing architecture and the user’s experience of it.

About GlogauAIR
In GlogauAIR artists from diverse social and geographical backgrounds find a place to develop their works in a dynamic environment of cooexistence, exchange of ideas and internationalization. At the same time they get to know a new culture and landscape in Berlin, getting influences from the city, which has become a pioneer place for contemporary culture.
The non profit organization GlogauAIR was founded by the Spanish artist Chema Alvargonzález in 2006 with the intention to create a meeting point between artists from all disciplines to work in collaboration, expanding their practice in terms of materials, formats and style. The processes are shown every three months in an open studios exhibition where the public can see the works of the resident artists in a relaxed and festive event.  
Parallel to the Residency Programme and the open studios we organise activities and exchange projects in collaboration with other institutions such as Videoart, Sound Art or Performance Festivals, exhibitions or artist presentations, where we invite local public, art lovers and professionals.  
Artists from all artistic disciplines (installation, video art, net.art, sculpture, creative writing, architecture, electronic music, painting, drawing, performance, photography, etc.) are invited to come as far as their project fits with our installations. Fourth times a year the artists can apply with a project for a residency for three or six months.
The applications are evaluated by a jury formed by professionals from the Berlin art community. Moreover some artists are selected and granted by different institutions in their home countries, with which we have collaboration agreements."
222,830230137,"Since moving to Baltimore half a decade ago, I have been fascinated with the convention scene of the area. Having lived in San Diego previously, I found the cons of Maryland, much more diverse in their audience and make up. For the last few years I have been involved in the convention scene in many roles: as an attendee, artist, vendor, panelist, community guest, department head, and senior staffer. During that time I have been researching the story of these events and have interviewed the people who run them.
The story of pop culture conventions is a fascinating one. Using the conventions of Maryland and DC as an entry point, I plan to put together a history book that details the history of such cons in the context of how they have affected fandoms, their host cities, and their various industries. However, as much passion as I have for this project, such a task is time consuming and I am not sure this niche topic will find an audience. Therefore I have launched a Kickstarter to gauge the public interest in such a history book. If this sounds like something that interests you, feel free to show your support by donating to the project. Even if you can’t, if you have interesting con experiences, we would love to know. Tell us your story.
Fandom Con History Comic Book 
For Phase I will be a mixed comic and text booklet on the history of Maryland's and DC's fan culture and connecting subjects. Each section of this history book plans to look at specific cons, divided by type and era. The first section looks at fandoms in a historical context. It looks at the centuries old argument whether fandoms and the entertainment arts are pure escapism or serve a fundamental human purpose.
The main body of this book is divided into six sections. Each section will be divided into three parts. The first part will be an introduction to the specific fandom and industry and its influence leading the next section on the list. Next, a belief overview of the historical formation of the different cons. Then finally the main part of each section focuses on the local cons themselves, the people who run them, the city that hosts them, and the years of stories from attendees."
223,719483618,"Alex and I (EC) founded an improv comedy team at our high school in the Fall of our Junior year. The past two years have been amazing, and we have turned a good profit! The downside? All profit goes to the drama department of our school, which is GREAT...buttttttttt, Alex and I are now seniors and about to go off to college. We will be leaving behind our team where we trained sixteen students on a weekly basis to perform gut-busting improv comedy shows!
We both had an idea to begin a comedy club downtown here in our homeland of JOHNSON CITY, TENNESSEEEEEEE *faint, yet dramatic echo*, but the issue arose that with how we are working, it will be many years before we can save up the money to even begin opening up our club, and as of the past twenty years, downtown Johnson City (actually, the entire city) hasn't had a good comedy club!
We have found an excellent building, but as of right now, that's it. We don't have the necessary funds to build a stage, buy chairs and tables, or even fix up the electrical in the building for that matter, so we are asking for YOUR help!
We plan to teach improvisational comedy classes as well as perform improv comedy shows every weekend, and hopefully begin doing sketch comedy as we further the club!
Our shows will be family friendly except for a ""No Holds Barred"" Comedy Show late Saturday nights.
Alex and I both will begin college in September in 2017, so we would like to begin the process of building sets, running lights, and everything we can do as soon as possible, so we can open by (HOPEFULLY) Spring of 2018!
Alex is going to study Performing Arts at East Tennessee State University while I plan on beginning my Business major at Northeast State Community College (and eventually transferring to ETSU after two years).
The two of us have both been doing improv all of our lives and have won many awards in competitive improv including 4th place out of 72 improv teams at a Tennessee State Tournament this past year!
Alex and I want to provide top notch improvisational comedy to audiences both locally and to those travelers who are coming to visit!
Thank you for all of your support and help with this project!"

Stretch Goal 3: Speedpaint video pack – £7000
If we reach £7000, I'll send everyone, that's all backers, digital and physical, a link to download recorded speedpaint videos of the creation of new pages! I'm going to be adding a bonus chapter at the end of the book to round it all out in preparation for a potential volume 2 (depending on how well she's received of course!) So I plan to record as many pages' creation as possible, here's an example of one video I made a while back for chapter 6. Sound good?
I'll try to record as many as possible as I work so that there's some nice video goodies for everyone if the final stretch goal is hit!
Between Worlds is the story of a knight cast out of her kingdom, falsely accused of Witchcraft. Her punishment? A shattering self, of memories, of identity and of home. Her sanctuary? A city of witches, incense, crystals and enchantments. Only issue is, she has no idea how she got there, not to mention, she HATES witches. She'll have to learn to make some friends if she wants to start a new life, and survive it.
A few pages from the completed comic
This special edition hardback is in celebration of 10 years since the launch of Between Worlds. Since 2009, it has lived in and on various formats until I took it down in retirement. The entire comic totals over 300 pages. This is to be the definitive version of Between Worlds.
As it is a webcomic created over such a span of time, there's a fair amount of fixing, primping and polish needed to bring it into our current, terrifying world. 
The majority of this work is basic reformatting and re-lettering in order to make it consistent (and pretty)
I also plan to give some of the rougher pages a little bit of a polish, though I don't plan on any significant changes or rewriting as that tends to be a bit of a creative black hole/Sisyphean nightmare. The aim of the game is collecting and presenting this comic in the smartest way possible.
If this project is funded, it'll enable me to take that time to format all 300+ pages into a beautiful book you'll be proud to have on your shelf.
The book I'm planning will be an A5 (148mm x 210mm) casebound hardcover book and will be a whopping 350(approx) pages.

Example Chapter Summaries
Introducing Africa's First Entrepreneurial State
Rwanda: a country nearly always judged by its tragic past and a destination not traditionally on tourists’ bucket lists.
Dig a little deeper, however, and you will find an exciting, evolving nation that is taking a unique approach to growth and development. Redefining what it means to be an entrepreneur, Rwanda is living up to its name as Africa’s First Entrepreneurial State. It is a fitting title for a country where a business can be started in 48 hours and children are taught entrepreneurship as part of the national curriculum. 
By 2020 the Rwandan Government aims to transform the country from a low-income, agricultural based economy to a middle-income, knowledge-based, service-oriented economy. A strong commitment to entrepreneurship as a driver for 21st century growth guides this aim. 
In 2016, award-winning photographer Cate Gunn and innovation specialist John Gunn partnered with the African Entrepreneur Collective in Rwanda to visually explore the untold stories fuelling one of Africa’s fastest growing economies.
Entrepreneurship From The Bottom Up
Entrepreneurs start young in Rwanda; the county's youth have been given the responsibility to dive economic growth and development as well as to build a culture of entrepreneurship from the bottom up.
In 2007, a series of entrepreneurship education programmes were developed for secondary schools that aimed to encourage a more entrepreneurial culture, transforming individuals and social norms.
By 2012, all secondary schools in the country were teaching entrepreneurship. Children as young as 11 were encouraged to develop entrepreneurial attitudes and taught how to identify and manage business opportunities as well as how to start and manage a business.
Over a million children had taken the course within its first two years.
 Rwanda's Digital City
Kigali, Rwanda’s charismatic and orderly capital city is leading the country’s digital revolution. 
Located in Rwanda’s centre and home to over a million people, Kigali is becoming known as an incubator for innovation. Across the city’s sprawling hills, budding entrepreneurs can choose from a selection of Innovation Hubs to network, cross-pollinate ideas and build their businesses. 
From SafeMotos, an Uber-esque moto-taxi company created to improve motorcycle taxi safety (80% of all road accidents in Kigali involve ‘motos'), to Jumia Food, Rwanda’s fast growing food service app and equivalent to Deliveroo, the clean and developed capital is home to more than a handful of Africa’s most exciting digital entrepreneurs.
Pioneering Conservation
The country's entrepreneurial culture has helped to drive innovation across every district.
Rwanda is now, for instance, leading the way in pioneering wildlife conservation. Home to three national parks, the biggest conservation success story lies deep in the forests of the Virunga Volcanoes. Discovered in 1902, Rwanda’s mountain gorillas – the world’s largest primate – have since suffered constant persecution. 
Critically endangered, an innovative conservation initiative has helped rebuild the remaining population. Centred on inclusive and sustainable eco-tourism, a limited number of highly priced tracking permits have been made available, providing the funds to protect the gorillas day and night with armed security. 
While offering a once-in-a-lifetime encounter for guests, 5% of all permit revenues are invested back into the local community, providing infrastructure and employment across the northwest region of Rwanda. 
Celebrated as one of the world’s best conservation case studies, the mountain gorillas are now the only primate species in the world that are increasing in numbers.
Innovation In Sport
Innovation in Rwanda stretches beyond the private sector. 
The Rwanda Cricket Stadium Foundation is currently constructing the country’s first international standard cricket facility on a 4.5-hectare plot on the outskirts of Kigali. By providing a green and pleasant environment where Rwandans of all ages can learn and improve their cricket, their mission is to provide people with skills they can use in their wider lives and, ultimately – on a broader scale – help promote reconciliation.
 For the Discerning Traveller
Over the last decade, Rwanda has emerged as a leading tourist destination in Africa.
This unique gem nestled in the heart of East Africa offers an evocative and enlightening lens on humanity, progression and conservation of natural beauty. From a turbulent past Rwanda has risen with unrivalled stamina and welcomes exploration, foreign investment and tourism with open arms.
Rwanda offers the discerning traveller a diverse range of experiences unparalleled on the continent. While wildlife enthusiasts can enjoy open-top jeep safaris across Akagera National Park, in search of lions, Hikers can explore the riches of Nyungwe Forest and Volcanoes National Parks. That’s not to mention the volcano crater lakes, age old mountain gorillas and a thriving capital city, Kigali.

If we raise in excess of £6,500 we'll be in a position to fund an official book launch, combined with a Beyond A Thousand Hills photography exhibition in Kigali, Rwanda.
A launch and exhibition will help to generate increased awareness as we continue to scale the project by working with East African tourist boards and local retailers.
Partners
The unique access to some of Rwanda's most exciting and inspiring stories wouldn't have been possible without the Beyond A Thousand Hills partners, based in Rwanda. 
The African Entrepreneur Collective (AEC) was founded in Rwanda in 2012, as a collection of Business Accelerators that support local entrepreneurs to drive job growth across the country.
AEC Accelerators partner with young entrepreneurs to build their skills, expand their networks, and grow their businesses so that they may employ others. Since launch, the model has already helped to create over 1200 jobs.
Akagera Aviation is one of Rwanda's leading aviation companies, with a unique fleet of helicopters offering services ranging from medical evacuation, wildlife surveying and national pilot training. Akagera Aviation have partnered with Beyond A Thousand Hills by offering unique aerial photography opportunities.
  Go Kigali was founded by Eliza Richman and Xavier Curtis in 2016 following the success of Go Addis (previously Addis Eats), Ethiopia’s #1 ranked tour company established in 2013. Go Kigali is the first tour company devoted to unique city tours in Kigali, Rwanda's charismatic capital city.
Local Impact
Despite the book still being in the production stage, the Beyond A Thousand Hills project has already captured hearts and minds out in Rwanda. Press coverage endorsing the book has been significant and the project even made the national news late last year.

Where The Funds Will Go
To date, the entire project has been 100% self-funded and all the content and photographs are in place.
A specialist London based design team is already on-board and working through initial mock-ups of the book.
We're turning to Kickstarter to raise the final amount necessary to print and publish the book. All the funds raised will be invested in the production of the book.

226,409903626,"Ever dream of traveling the world? Let us tell you a little bit about our dreams to travel the globe:
Traveling is an expensive endeavor - while we planned, and saved and hustled as hard as we could... there are still a handful of expenses we have yet to pay for in the upcoming months leading to our departure date.  Some of these items include: vaccinations, travelers' Insurance, train passes, airfare to different regions, new camera gear and accommodations for stay.  
While some of these expenses are more of a priority than others - we cannot waste time in raising and saving enough money before we leave to journey and tour the world in September 2015.   
Not only is this fund an effort to raise money for our trip but it is also an opportunity for you to invest in my new business: Frankieboy Photography LLC.  This company and passion of mine is a dedication to my father Frank H. Spontelli Jr. - my father has always motivate me to create, build and operate a business of my own as he once did.  I recently purchased the LLC to officially turn my little photography 'idea/hobby' into a reality - a business of my own.  While I may never own the giant warehouses filled with printing presses as my Dad once did - this LLC is the start at a small empire of photography printing mastery.  My dream is to return from traveling the world with a plethora of images and build a photo printing studio of my own.  We also want to take our blog www.meetyouthere.me to the next level - so that we can continue to travel and adventure while sharing our ventures with the rest of the world. "

They are starting to put their lives just the way they want, but they start to notice a lot of odd occurances around the apartments with the other tenents and the landlord, but more so with the repairman. He does not look too scary, not like anyone would expect, he seems nice, but there is something about him they just dont trust and with good reason. He just got out of jail and to earn his keep he has to do what the boss tells him, the boss happens to be the landlord. How far will he go to stay out of jail, what was he in jail for to begin with, just how twisted are they all......"
229,1508847683,"It started with a text-message conversation between my husband Brian and I (while we were both in the same house). I had just finished reading this Grounded Parents post, and sent the link to Brian along with the brief statement: “We need to make a documentary about these women.” His response: “Let’s do it.” And so, “Science Moms” was born.
To me, this is more than a film project. It’s a quest to find moms (and dads) who haven’t fallen under the spell of the anti-vax, anti-GMO, anti-science movements. We want to amplify the voices of scientists and activists, but we also want to hear from other parents who are making rational, science-based decisions in their everyday lives. After seeing Gwyneth Paltrow go to Washington, “not as a scientist, but as a mother,” I feel compelled to make a similar statement. Brian and I are not scientists (he works in TV/film, and I’m a Montessori school administrator). We’re parents to two awesome kids. We're also advocates for reason and science, and, just as importantly, advocates against the fear that plagues so many parents today. 
The anti-vax and anti-GMO movements, in particular, seem to me to be rooted in fear. If, through this project, we could alleviate just one person’s fears about food, medicine, and health, we’ve succeeded. Brian and I will share personal anecdotes about science-minded living as we move through this project. We would love to hear from you about your experiences as science-minded parents and science-lovers, through posts to our FaceBook page, or through messages to us on FB. Tell us why you vaccinate your children. Tell us why you support biotechnology. Tell us about some rad science experiments that you did with your kids. We want to hear it!
In addition to your enthusiasm and feedback, we would love to receive your financial backing for this project. This Kickstarter campaign, when successful, will repay us for the cost of our fabulous directors of photography from our Madison, WI-based shoot with Kavin Senapathy, our Atlanta shoot with Alison Bernstein, and our local shoot with Anastasia Bodnar, and will cover the cost of future DPs, travel expenses, and animation.

230,1775951535,"***UPDATE 22/12/15  We made it! Thank you to everyone for your support and backing. A wonderful campaign and glad to have shared it with you. Any additional pledges still welcomed and additional funds raised as a result will still be of benefit to the film. Our thanks again.
Warm greetings and welcome to London Recruits - the sensational story of the young men and women who undertook clandestine missions for the ANC during the bleakest years of the apartheid regime. With your help, their gripping tale that remained secret for over 40 years, will come to the big screen for the first time. 
Ronnie Kasrils (left) recruited young Londoners for the missions, himself under instruction from the ANC leader in exile Oliver Tambo (right)
At a time when ANC membership was banned, its activists executed or imprisoned, exiled leader Oliver Tambo lit the fuse on a plan that saw young women and men travel to South Africa disguised as honeymooning couples, tourists and business trippers. Recruited by Ronnie Kasrils, working undercover in London, the volunteers exploited the ‘whites only’ policies of apartheid South Africa. Under the noses of the police they unfurled banners from landmarks, exploded home-made leaflet bombs at packed train stations and played rousing speeches to crowds from improvised sound systems, signalling to thousands of Africans living under the regime that the struggle for freedom was very much alive.
London Recruits: Mary Chamberlain, Norman Lucas and John Rose. The first missions were in 1969 and over the next five years Ronnie recruited and ran over 40 top secret missions into apartheid South Africa.
The huge personal risk involved in these missions was brought all too sharply into focus for those few who were caught, tortured and imprisoned. Many recruits remained anonymous long after apartheid had ended, reflective of the danger and secrecy of their missions against one of the 20th century's most brutal regimes. Now, nearly 50 years on, the legacy of their work can finally be celebrated on film. With unique access to the brave women and men who risked their lives in solidarity with the liberation struggle, London Recruits will tell their story. 
The Film
This is documentary as high drama. London Recruits is a thriller in every sense of the word. British and South African intelligence are hot on their heels, the recruits have little or no back up on the ground and for many this is their first trip abroad. There’s humour in their near misses, but the dangers are all too real. Those who are caught face torture and solitary confinement. The wider struggle often appears hopeless and the missions are absolutely secret, even from loved ones.
The film is a roller coaster adventure that offers a timely challenge to us today: in a world still full of racism and injustice, have any of us got what it takes to be London Recruits? We will mix archive footage, interviews and dramatisation to tell this dramatic thriller about those who risked their lives for what is right.
The Timeline
We have recorded initial interviews with many of the London Recruits, alongside work conducted on the ground in South Africa. We've tracked down journalists, police officers and security officials who were involved in the events as they unfolded. We've met with eye witnesses who remember the leaflet bombs, the banners and the sense of euphoria when spirits were lifted by successful missions. 
We are preparing the final shooting script for the drama reconstruction elements. We will shoot the bulk of that reconstruction in the summer of 2016, with a premiere in mind for the autumn.  
The Team
We've assembled an amazing team for London Recruits, a crew that can deliver a great result for this important story. Heading up the project are Barefoot Rascals, a production company led by Gordon Main and Peter Edwards. They put compelling stories and great characters into the heart of everything they do. We have the overwhelming support from many of the London Recruits whose participation and contribution to the film is paramount. Moreover, Ronnie Kasrils has lent the production his full backing and is a vital player as we uncover the secrets and mysteries of this fascinating time in the South African struggle. 
Ronnie Kasrils with London Recruit Ken Keable. The film is based on Ken's book of the same name.
Why Crowdfund?
We have raised seed development funding from Ffilm Cymru Wales and received support from trade unions in the UK. Those unions were at the forefront of the international struggle against apartheid with their members playing a crucial role in solidarity work. We have carried out initial research and interviews but rely upon an injection of fresh funding to bring us into production. We appreciate the story will have wide appeal to a generation who participated in the anti apartheid movement alongside a new generation that draws inspiration from it. We've carefully chosen rewards we think you will like and in the spirit of the story. 
By backing the campaign you'll play an integral role to realise the project and become part of the London Recruits community of friends and supporters. Every penny will help get this project made. The producers are committed to paying cast and crew fairly and we face the costs that come with shooting abroad; transportation, rentals and so on. Funding independent films is tougher than ever and eternal thanks and gratitude go to those who'll help us fulfil this part of our budget.
We hope our friends and supporters will enjoy sharing this incredible journey with us and play a part in getting such a vitally important story to the big screen."

March 2016: The Kickstarter campaign ends. Backers will be added to a mailing list, to get updates quick. Main updates will also be added to the kickstarter page.
August 2016: Beta opens for our backers. Bugs and suggestions can be added. Socialize-Mugs will be shipped.
Around Oktober 2016: If everything is ok, beta will get closed and socialize opens for all members. This could also happen around November or December, if there are major problems in the beta.
We don't want to display any ads on our beautiful social network, nor will we ever spam you with our mails. Still we need to pay hosting and the domain. Plus, we need to make a security check to be sure, that your data is save from hackers. 
With the target of 5'000 CHF/USD, we can get a penetration test and pay hosting and domain for a foreseeable future.

233,2137074516,"Shrink-O-Lantern.. Step-up Your Pumpkin Game!! Not just a product, it's a movement!
 With the funding from Kickstarter, Shrink-O-Lantern‘s mission is to be the leader in introducing innovative, high quality, first-to-the-market pumpkin designs with a diversified appeal that enhance our customer’s pumpkin decorating experience while at the same time reaching numerous stylized societies. The timing is perfect for the starting of this new venture as the pumpkin design industry is currently experiencing a lull in innovative designs and creativity. Traditionally pumpkin decorating consist of removing its top, scooping out the interior pulp, and cutting the desired forms into the side of the pumpkin, producing an image composed of variously shaped holes or pits in the pumpkin's walls.The addition of a light within the pumpkin causes the holes and other cut-away portions of the pumpkin to appear to glow.While the effect produced by this technique can be pleasing, it produces a limited range of images: it takes skill and specialized tools to produce most of the shapes in the pumpkin's thick walls, and the use of color, aside from the natural color of the pumpkin, is of course impossible.Thus far the Phase 1, Shrink-O-Lantern designs have received positive feedback throughout the US for its fresh outlook and edgy designs. Our immediate future plans are to introduce glow in the dark, 3D, Collegiate, and Holographic Shrink-O-Lanterns, thus producing a more diverse product line. Like us on Facebook:

SHRINK-O-LANTERN...IT'S NOT JUST A PRODUCT, IT'S A MOVEMENT
STEP-UP YOUR PUMPKIN GAME
The SOL Story
In Oct of 2010 I was carving pumpkins the traditional way with my Girlfriend and her three boys. We cut the top, scooped out the insides causing a complete mess, poked a picture stencil for an hour, carved for another hour and a half..and then BAM!! hours later we had Jack-O-Lanterns!!! So if you read between the lines what I really just said is that the gutting of the pumpkin is a mess, the carving tools are unsafe for kids, the poking give you serious hand cramps.....oh and did I mention that after the first 15 mins into the carving process the boys were nowhere to be found! After all that work we set the pumpkins outside only to see them two day later completely mushed and folding in on themselves..sprinkle some mold and insects in the mix and you get the picture. So I decided that something needed to be done about this age old problem. So I created SHRINK-O-LANTERN, a product that eliminates ALL the dislikes of pumpkin carving! It requires minimal time (3-4 mins), is safe for ALL ages, increases the life of your pumpkin, give your pumpkins style & swagger...and get this, ALL YOU NEED IS A HAIRDRYER!! Don't just take my word for it though, just visit www.shrinkolantern.com and see this amazing product for yourself.
THIS IS A PRODUCT THAT SPEAKS FOR ITSELF.......THE TESTIMONIALS
S.O.L.Testimonials from Year One.... I ASKED....... Did the product perform like you thought it would? Did you have any problems with it? Were the instructions clear? Would it be something you would do again or recommend to friends and family? Thanks in advance! 
 Hello! I LOVED the Shrink-O-Lantern! In the past, I have avoided pumpkin carving. My daughter and I both hated the mess and I wasn't thrilled with having a rotting pumpkin on my front porch. So most years we didn't carve pumpkins. But this year was different. I was very excited to try your product. I was surprised at how easy it was and we thought shrinking it with the hair dryer was fun. It wasn't difficult AT ALL. Loved them and will definitely buy them again!!! :) -Michele Means- 
 No problems at all! I would definitely do it again and recommend to others. I'm actually surprised at how well it shrunk/formed around the pumpkin. I think it's fabulous! -Beth Rinderknecht- 
 I loved it & it was super easy to do!!!! The only problem I had...had nothing to do with the product...it was with the hair dryer! Would totally recommend it to anyone!!! Just takes a couple minutes!!! Thanks again! -Tiffany Howe- 
 No problem. It was real easy. The kids did their own without my help. They loved it. Said it was way better than carving. They were very excited to do it again. I think they liked painting and decorating with it also. I would never let them use a knife to carve so this was much more their own pumpkins. It was a great time. -Cory Sparks- 
 Of course, and I’ve already recommended it to others. My boss said for you to do Super Heros for kids…she has a young son. People LOVE the idea and want more. I love it, I hate carving pumpkins and it only took 2 mins to get it on. -Bridgette Hamilton-
 I was very satisfied with my Shrink-O-Lantern purchase. The packaging was easy to open and the instructions were simple to follow. I was apprehensive to see that there was only the one strip of tape on the one end of the film to hold everything in place, but to my surprise it held the film together and in place while it shrunk. It was so easy that even my eight year old son put his on by himself with no trouble at all! I really appreciate having a quick, no-mess option to help us decorate our pumpkins and we can’t wait to have more design options available for purchase next year! The only negative thing Ethan said was that he wanted a different design/color than his sister. Maybe even some more kid friendly designs in the future, Mia really likes princesses and fairies!  -Rene Sedlacek-

234,216195376,"Hallo,
wir alle haben fast tagtäglich mit Flüchtlingen zu tun. Ob nun im direkten Austausch durch das Vorbeilaufen an Flüchtlingsheimen, durch das Spenden an Kleiderkammern oder Hilfsorganisationen oder mit dem Lesen der Tageszeitung.
Viele Menschen sehen zur Lösung dieser Aufgabe viele mögliche Ansätze, bei denen ein ""richtig"" oder ""falsch"" bisher nicht ersichtlich ist. Dennoch stellt sich die Frage, was wir als Bürger Deutschlands dafür tun können, um die Integration der Flüchtlinge zu beschleunigen, die Gemeinschaft zu stärken und die Ankunft zu vereinfachen.
Werte sind häufig sehr unterschiedlich. Der Eine setzt auf Qualität, der Andere auf Quantität. Gerade in einer diversifizierten Gesellschaft wie unserer ist es schwer, sich auf eine bestimmte Idee zu einigen. Dennoch gibt es eins, das uns vereint: 
Das Grundgesetz
Dieses Buch stellt wohl am effizientesten dar, worauf wir uns als Zusammenschluss von 80 Millionen Menschen berufen. Daher sollten wir dieses dazu nutzen, Flüchtlinge zu bilden und ihnen deren Rechte und Pflichten zu erläutern.
Das Projekt zielt darauf ab, dass jede Familie ein Grundgesetz besitzen sollte, um sich mit dem Staat Deutschland befassen zu können und etwas über das Land zu erfahren, in dem sie wohl eine längere Zeit verbringen werden. Viele Gesetze galten womöglich nicht in ihrem Heimatland, weshalb sie durch dieses Buchprojekt erfahren können, welche Rechte und Pflichten sie haben.
FAQ:
Was ist das Video, von dem in den Belohnungen gesprochen wird?
Ich werde von der Verteilung ein Video machen, um euch Supportern zu zeigen, was Ihr mit Eurer Spende erreicht habt. Zu diesem bekommt Ihr einen Link, der gültig ist noch bevor das Video für alle öffentlich gemacht wird.
Was passiert mit dem Geld, welches zu viel gespendet wird?

A Gala will be hosted to display the prints and recognize the photographers for their work and participation. 
The Funds raised from the event and sales of the photo book will be donated to support those affected by homelessness in Ottawa.

The aim of this project is to launch some ‘Memoirs of Africa’ postcards exclusively for all those on Kickstarter.

Backing card and pin concept.
2018 marks 100 years since the first women in the UK won the right to vote. As a passionate voter myself, I wanted to create a new pin to mark the occasion. Where better to draw inspiration than from the powerful legacy of The Suffragettes, after all I wouldn't be able to make a single mark on any ballot paper without their courageous campaigning.
The Pin
30mm
Hard enamel
Black Nickel Plating
Rubber Clutch
Comes attached to an illustrated backing card.
For my design, I've particularly drawn on the iconic purple, green and white Suffragette colour palette, which was often also reflected in the jewellery they wore at the time. Throughout history we’ve seen how important it is to speak up to effect change. So when you may be feeling frustrated and overwhelmed with the state of things, I hope this pin can help pick you back up and encourage you to keep making your mark. Just a small X in a box can be a powerful tool!

240,302938875,"This project is to support Revolver Studios in adding an aerial program to their studio. 
WHY
We want to add an aerial program to our offerings because...
1)  We want to offer more ways for people to express themselves through movement. 
We know the value and benefits of movement, performing arts, and self-expression. Movement holds the ability to inspire, empower, and heal. We watch our students grow in profound ways from engaging in movement; whether it's dance, fitness, or otherwise. They are inspired to express and tap into their creativity. They are empowered to step outside their comfort zones and to truly believe in themselves. It's the #1 reason we do the work we do; because it changes people's lives. 
2) We will provide something needed in the aerial arts world (and the world in general); body-positivity. 
The unfortunate truth is that many studios/facilties in the world are not providing a body-positive environment at all; or claim to be but are lacking the knowledge, intention and deep commitment to do so. 
We recognize that many bodies have been entirely left out when it comes to dance, fitness, and aerial movement spaces. We recognize that many bodies have felt like a burden, and even unsafe in dance, fitness, and aerial movement spaces. 
This is simply not okay. So we're changing it. 
Revolver Studios is founded upon creating space where ALL people, ALL bodies, and ALL levels can enjoy movement. Our team is always learning & growing. Each staff member is trained to meet you where you're at with compassion, encouragement, and kindness; always using body-positive language and teaching methods. This applies to our students as well, we work to maintain a culture of inclusivity and support amongst everyone who steps through our doors. 
3) We believe in the St Cloud community and want to see it grow. 
Revolver Studios owner, Scarlette Revolver, is dedicated to elevating arts and culture in the St. Cloud area. Scarlette is a small business owner, avid supporter of downtown, and an active community member lending support to as many projects, events, and fellow artists/entrepreneurs as possible. Scarlette often gets asked why she chose to set up shop here in St. Cloud, rather than Minneapolis or another larger city. 
It's because she believes in watering the grass in her own backyard first, and she believes deeply in St. Cloud's potential. Scarlette knows that growing her business in the St. Cloud community will help boost the local economy and provide more unique experiences in the downtown area. The aerial program at Revolver Studios will also create more opportunities for dance and performing arts to grow and thrive in the area. Scarlette wants more people to experience the many incredible locally-owned businesses and blossoming arts community St Cloud has to offer. She knows Revolver Studios will add yet another reason for people to visit and discover what a special community St. Cloud truly is. 
4) You asked! 
Both Scarlette and Nicole's clients have been asking for YEARS when we're going to bring our brand of aerial classes to St Cloud...so we're finally making it happen! 
5) It's fun as hell, ya'll. 
I mean, enough said. Aerial is really, super fun. And we like fun. We like fun the MOST. 
HOW
The only way we'll accomplish this project is with YOUR help. 
Our budget for the project is as follows... 
Professional Rigging ... $600
Apparatuses ... $800 
Hardware ... $800 
Mats ... $1,000
Marketing ... $1,000 
Kickstarter Fees, backer rewards, shipping, etc ... $300
= $4,500 
We will be bringing in a highly trained and experienced professional rigger to install four rigs to ensure optimum safety and proper protocol. The apparatuses are the aerial fabrics themselves and all the necessary hardware to go along with them. Of course mats are essential for safety as well.

The purpose of this Kickstarter is to create, print and distribute a Remastered Edition of The Luxura Collection #1!
A 48 page FULL COLOR collection of Luxura's first 4 appearances from the original Vamperotica Comic Series.
HARDCOVER EDITION
This book is available in a HARDCOVER, NAUGHTY and REGULAR EDITION! 
NAUGHTY EDITION!
REGULAR EDITION
 REWARD SPOTLIGHT!
The Vampress Luxura is my original character that was the star of my highly successful Vamperotica comic series which ran for 50 issues and also spun off into several mini-series and magazines.
For those of you that are just discovering Luxura for the first time, let me give you a little information about her history and story line. 
 Luxura belongs to a race of vampires known as the 'Kith'. Although her exact age has not yet been disclosed, she is at least several centuries old. She has made good use of this time, building her own shadow empire that spans the globe. The heart of this empire is a complex in Manhattan, New York. It is a vast network of tunnels, caverns, and trophy rooms.
Luxura is an avid collector. While much of her many collections have monetary value, most items are kept for sentimental value. Amongst the armor, jewelry, clothing, books and weapons, there is the crown jewel of her collections... the Blood Vault. This vault, believed by many to be the largest in the world, contains thousands of wine bottles filled with magically preserved blood. Each bottle is carefully labeled, and displays a portrait or photograph of the donor. In her Blood Vault is every conceivable historical figure that you can think of from Julius Caesar to John F. Kennedy.
Luxura is a strong believer in the rule of law, and actively works to enforce the three main tenets of Kith society- sustaining mortals as a plentiful food source, regulating the Kith to prevent anarchy, and maintaining discretion so mortals are not alerted to the existence of Kith.

This book is a perfect introduction to the Vampress Luxura for new readers and excellent collector's item for existing fans!

It also features a Vampress Luxura pin-up gallery by Kirk Lindo.
All of the art has been carefully remastered and recolored from full sized scans of the original pages."
244,1336986834,"Hello! My name is Cameron Hines. Born and raised in Columbus,Ohio I am currently a twenty year old open book ready to take on the world. I have recently finished my first novel of many. My plan for the money that is raised through this blessed platform is to invest in getting my book published and advertising my work so it can reach the masses. My intended audience is anyone who can read, including non readers. My creation ""Sovereignty of Spades"" is a cadenced young adult/ adult fiction story that combines traditional prose with dramatic dialogue to create a distinct, genre-spanning reading experience. Ever since Khalif Kendrix was little, he has played his cards like a king. Labeled as gifted until he transforms into a rebel while in high school, seventeen-year-old Khalif shuns everything he has ever been taught, drops out of high school, and journeys down a dark path into the unknown.
Now a lost soul wandering through the shadows, Khalif is moving loafs and bringing home a few thousand a week. His mother is gone—brutually murdered during a weekday bible study by a white supremist. His father appears to be clueless about how Khalif is making a living, despite living in the same house with him. But everything changes one day when the feds bust five of his drug buddies. Now as Khalif unfurls a new plan to survive, he has no idea that he is about to be led in a direction he never could have imagined in his wildest dreams.
Sovereignty of Spades is the gripping tale of a street-smart kid on an unforgettable journey into the unknown where he hopes to eventually reach his destiny—and more importantly, his true potential."

Here are some comments by the author of Xerox Ferox, John Szpunar:
 NIGHT… of the LIVING DEAD!  
Some time ago, amigo Steve Bissette posted a query on Facebook. I can’t remember his exact words, but the gist of the question went something like this: “In your opinion, what are some movies that every student of comic book artwork should see?” I puzzled over this one for some time. The German expressionists immediately sprang to mind, as well as the works of Mario Bava, Orson Welles, and Terry Gilliam. I thought of Brian De Palma, with his masterful use of the split-screen. Jean Luc Godard came to mind, as well. His brilliant use of jump cuts echoed the comic book sentiment that I believe Steve was referring to. The classic shower scene in Psycho soon followed. And then… I got to thinking about George A. Romero and his self-proclaimed “Cubist” style of editing. “Good Lord!” I thought! George’s movies actually WERE living comic books! And there is no better example than Night of the Living Dead. George was a self-proclaimed EC Comics fanatic, and the influence of his comic book style of editing is evident in ALL of his early films. Dawn of the Dead. Martin. The Crazies. Creepshow. And, especially, in Night of the Living Dead. Move over, Miller and Rodriguez! NOTLD is a graphic novel come to life! All these years later, it would make sense for a team of comix artists and writers to revisit the fertile stomping grounds that George once tread. And what do you know? The time has come! FantaCo Enterprises is proud to announce the OFFICIALLY AUTHORIZED ""50th Anniversary NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD"" Graphic Novel! Don’t dare miss out on this one! Please stay a while and visit with us. We’re coming to get YOU!!! ~John Szpunar

248,1924722919,"Update: Strrreeetch Goal!
The $4000 Kickstarter goal has been met in only three days! I've decided to create a stretch goal of $10,000 which will allow for full paper upgrades, more pages in the book, and an open gallery night this summer in Vancouver, BC. Keep sharing this Kickstarter to help reach this stretch goal!
Project Pilgrim is my effort to work towards normalizing mental health.
This spring, I intend to walk the 1000km Camino de Santiago and along the way interview and photograph people I meet and engage them in a discussion around mental health. The outcome of my trip will be a website and printed book capturing the comments, insights, and portrait photographs of those that I meet. I hope that this collection of ideas can further the conversation that needs to continue around mental health. The book will be pre-sold through this Kickstarter campaign which will run over the course of March in order to offset the costs of this project. Donations will also be gratefully accepted through this Kickstarter campaign.
A Summary:
The Camino de Santiago, a famous pilgrimage route, hosts ~250,000 pilgrims a year as they walk from Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port, France to Santiago de Compostela, Spain. There have been multiple movies, multimedia websites, blogs, and several books done about the Camino which have all been very successful. I’ve decided to do something of my own.
This May, I will be walking this pilgrimage alone in order to work towards breaking down the stigma around mental health. On the Camino, people are walking (sometimes alone) for a month or more. They become very self reflective. I plan to tap into this introspection and inquire as to people’s thoughts regarding mental health. I believe that because the people I meet will be especially aware of themselves, they will have some very interesting things to say. My hope is that by collecting many people’s opinions and sharing them with you, we will all come to a better understanding of what mental health is and how to overcome issues we may face.
A picture is worth a thousand words, but a picture with an emotional connection to it is worth many times more. My goal is that by taking people’s photos and asking them about mental health, I can start a conversation that can work towards breaking down the stigma around mental health. Talking about mental health normalizes mental health and my hope is that Project Pilgrim can be one of the many stepping stones needed in order to make mental health an everyday conversation.
So...What Is It?
Project Pilgrim first and foremost is a collection of people’s responses and opinions towards mental health. Over December, 2015 and January, 2016 I took 120 of my friend’s photos which I have paired with their thoughts towards mental health. I will be posting these daily until the end of April (below are some select examples). In May, I will be heading to France and Spain to walk the famous 1000km Camino de Santiago pilgrimage route. As I walk, I will take photos of the people I meet and combine their portraits with their thoughts and responses towards mental health. I will post these photos on the Facebook Page, Instagram, as well as on the website. The end result will be a consolidation of these photos and their captions in a website and printed photo book. This book will be pre-sold at a discount through this Kickstarter over the month of March. Several Canadian organizations are partnering and supporting this project in various ways. More information will be available soon as to who is involved.
Another aspect of this project includes the reason why I ended up dropping out of school last year. I was suffering from social anxiety which led to depression. My social anxiety was highly specific to the particular situation of meeting new people for the first time. After seeking help and going through therapy, I was able to overcome this challenge and I am now ready to use my circumstances as a testament to the benefit of getting help. On the Camino I will be walking alone and will be meeting new people multiple times a day. I will use this opportunity of meeting new people to ask them about their thoughts concerning mental health and take their photo. I hope that by me demonstrating how I am “facing my fears” I will encourage others who were struggling like I was to reach out and get the help that is available.
Test photos for Project Pilgrim. This selection was photos were all taken in Vancouver, BC in December, 2015. Click here to see more test photos.
 What is the Camino?
The Camino de Santiago, specifically the Way of St. James, is a 1000km long ancient pilgrimage route to Santiago de Compostela in Galicia, Spain. For thousands of years, Christian pilgrims from across the world have made their way along this route to the city of Santiago de Compostela where the remains of apostle St. James are reported to be buried. Nowadays, people walk this route for many reasons. In fact, over the last few years only 40% of the people who have completed the Camino did it for religious reasons. 55% did it for ""cultural and other"" reasons and 5% did it for non-religious reasons.
The French Way of the Camino de Santiago. I will be hiking the Spain portion beginning in St. Jean Pied De Port and ending in Santiago de Compostela. I will then continue on to Finisterre on the coast of Spain.
The Camino is set up in such a way to accommodate for the ~250,000 people who walk it every year. There are auberges (pilgrim hostels) in most towns along the route allowing for pilgrims to walk anywhere from 10 to 40km a day. These auberges offer a dormitory style bed usually with a hot shower for ~€10 a night. Food can either be bought or carried (some auberges offer a shared small kitchen) but most people opt to eat in local restaurants for meals. For meals and accommodation I have budgeted €25/day for my 35 day journey.
The Idea:
My idea for Project Pilgrim came by combining three of my passions: Photography, Mental Health, and The Outdoors.
Photography: Photography is one of my greatest passions. Project Pilgrim will consist of portraits of the people I meet along the Camino de Santiago. These photos will be shared on this site, the Facebook Page, as well as Instagram. Afterwards, these photos and the subject’s mental health response will be turned into a book.
Mental Health: Mental health is something I hold very close to me. In November of 2014, I was forced to withdraw from school in order to address my own mental health issues. Now I want to give back. My hope is that Project Pilgrim will start a conversation around mental health. As I walk the Camino, I will talk to the people I meet about their thoughts and opinions towards mental health. Their responses will be included with their photo as I post along the way. To read more about me and my mental health journey click here.
The Outdoors: The outdoors is where I find my therapy. In my down time, you can almost always find me climbing, hiking, kayaking, or trying something new outside. The Camino consists of walking 1000km across Northern Spain - it’s perfect for me. To read more about the Camino click here.
The name Project Pilgrim comes from the Camino de Santiago. The Camino is a historic pilgrimage route starting in France and ending in Santiago de Compostela in Northwest Spain. Historically, pilgrims have walked this route from all over the world as a spiritual journey to see the reported remains of the apostle St. James. More recently, this pilgrimage has been done mostly for cultural rather than religious reasons. To read more about the Camino click here.
Okay...So Why The Kickstarter?
Book printing companies require a minimum bulk order to print at discounted rates. I will be pre-selling the book through this Kickstarter in order to ensure I meet that minimum order as well as cover the money I have already put into this project (design, website, etc). The $4000 minimum goal will cover all of those costs (there is a cost breakdown below).
Trip Cost Breakdown:
I have done my research for the Camino and found it appropriate to budget $20/day for food and $15/day for hostels over the 35 days I will be walking. The Kickstarter goal only covers the Design Costs for this trip. The other costs will be covered if the Kickstarter reaches a stretch goal of $10,000.
Cost breakdown of my trip. $4000 is what I expect to be the total cost.
Book Cost Breakdown:
In order to remain transparent, below is a breakdown of where your money will be going if you choose the book as a reward. Please note that shipping is not included.
Cost breakdown of where your $33 will go towards for every book pre-ordered
The Book:
A mock up copy of the book Project Pilgrim I made.
The book Project Pilgrim will come in one size (7in x 7in) and feature high quality Proline Uncoated 100lb paper which is durable and is heavier than regular paper. Depending on how much the Kickstarter is funded, the book will contain anything from 36-42 pages. The inside of the book will be simple. It will feature the pilgrim's portrait along with their response to my mental health question for them.
An inside look at the book Project Pilgrim
Timeline:
An estimate timeline of Project Pilgrim.
Above is an estimate timeline for Project Pilgrim. If the Kickstarter is a success, I will open an online bookstore and donation site on projectpilgrim.org for those of you unable to get a book or give during this Kickstarter. However, donations and books are encouraged to be purchased through the Kickstarter as they will help me reach my Kickstarter goal.
Something else of note is the date you will receive your rewards. Current estimates point to late July or early August for delivery of your books and prints. The portrait sessions will happen sometime in the summer of 2016 with a deadline at the end of August.
The Catch:
Here comes the bad news. If this Kickstarter does not reach it's initial $4000 goal, this trip won't happen. All of the work and money I have put into this project will have been for nothing and I will have to make up my lost costs by working instead of doing the Camino. Please make a pledge towards this Kickstarter to make this dream of mine become a reality.
How To Follow Along:
Anyone can follow along without making a pledge towards my trip. Please follow my Instagram and Facebook page dedicated to this project. As well, I have a website (projectpilgrim.org) that I will be posting my blogs and photos on.

249,1257551867,"DoSo™ Violin
What is the DoSo Violin?
The DoSo Violin is an inexpensive electric violin that sounds great when plugged into a small Fender Mustang 1 guitar amplifier.
As you can hear in the video above, the DoSo Violin is, first and foremost, a great sounding instrument no matter what style of music you play.
It’s also been designed so it can be produced at a low enough price to make it a real option for anyone who wants to plug in and expand their playing opportunities.
With The DoSo Violin You Can Easily Plug in and Rock Out
The Goal of DoSo Violin
Too many violin students give up the violin simply because they feel other instruments offer them more opportunities to play. Now with The DoSo Violin any violinist will be able to join groups like jazz and dance bands or even the garage band down the street.
Our goal is to create a great sounding and inexpensive electric violin so that violinists, especially young violinists, have more opportunities and places to play.
By supporting this campaign you’re helping make the DoSo Violin a reality. We encourage you to get one for yourself or your child or to contribute in order to help put a DoSo Violin into the hands a young musician who couldn’t otherwise afford one.
Our Goal Is To Give Violinists More Opportunities To Play So Fewer Kids Give Up The Violin
Who’s Helped Create The DoSo?
David Mills is the creator of the DoSo Violin but he’s had support from many great friends in the music business.
First and foremost is Fan-Chia Tao, the R&D Director for D’Addario. Having just the right strings (Helicore medium tension) is essential to the sound of the instrument. With Fan-Chia’s support we were able to experiment with multiple types of strings, mixing and matching them with different violins and pickup systems to create the perfect sound.
Tony Pasqualoni is a mechanical engineer, musician and luthier who, in his spare time, repairs violins for the Sam Ash store in New Haven, CT.
Les Schatten from Schatten Design created the V0-2 Pro pickup system.
 Peter Stoney is the musician-inventor who came up with the Fiddle Fretter.
Rich Ferris, the marketing representative for Cremona Violins, helped us determine the perfect stock violin, the SV-175, to serve as the base of the DoSo Electric Violin.
And finally, you, because it will truly be the support of musicians, music fans, educators, fiddlers, violinists and parents of young violinists all coming together to support this campaign that will make the DoSo Violin a reality.
What Are The Rewards?
The primary reward is the amazing DoSo Violin itself. For just $450 you’ll get the DoSo Violin complete with Fiddle Fretter, Helicore strings and a Schatten V02 Pro pickup system. It comes with a plush-lined case and basic bow plus instructions on how to program the inexpensive Fender Mustang 1 amplifier to work perfectly with the DoSo Violin.
The DoSo Violin Is Just $450 and Includes the Case, Bow, & Instructions
At the $40 reward level you can help put a DoSo Violin into the hands of a young violinist through our partnership music schools. We’ll be asking our backers to help select the programs that will receive these violins.
You can also get a CD of music performed on amplified string instruments; Sheet music and MP3 play-along recordings of DoSo Dance Band arrangements featuring – 1st and 2nd violin, alto sax, cello, guitar, bass guitar and drums; or even learn string improvisation in a special class with David Mills in NYC, Nashville or New Haven, CT.
The DoSo Violin Sounds Great Plugged Into an Inexpensive Fender Amp
Why Kickstarter
Our goal wasn’t just to figure out how to make a great sounding electric violin, which was a challenge all by itself, but to make sure that it is actually affordable. Even with the generous support from our suppliers, who believe in the project, we still need to order the parts in bulk to keep the price down.
All the design and and testing is complete, now we just need to put in our order and start putting DoSo Violins into the hands of every violin player who wants to plug in, get down and rock out.
The DoSo Violin Looks Almost As Good As It Sounds
 FAQ
What Do I Plug into?
We recommend the Fender Mustang 1 Amplifier.
Why a Fender Mustang 1 amplifier?
Even a high-priced electric violin will sound scratchy and irritating through a standard guitar amp. Professional players typically run directly through the PA system. A small Fender Mustang 1 amp can be pre-programmed for the violin. We will show you how it’s done. Although the Mustang 1 is small and not very powerful, you can place it behind you as your monitor speaker, and in a band situation, you can drape a microphone over the front to send sound to the PA. (We like the inexpensive Samson R-11 microphone that doesn’t pick up as much white noise as a high-fidelity mic.)
Can you play a DoSo Violin unplugged?
Yes. Although the instrument unplugged is not as loud as a high-priced, finely-carved violin, it still has a great sound. 
What do you mean by “spatial awareness?”
Jazz violinists use the term “frame shifting” to describe the technique of transposing melodic patterns in upper positions, i.e. without using open strings. For example, if you look at the diagram below you see a diagram of a fretted violin neck with five natural modes that begin on E. Those scales can be transposed to any other location on the neck and have the same relative sound. The violinist does not even have to compute the key signature of the new location.
The DoSo Violin Can Help You Discover A New Sense of Spatial Awareness
Tell Me About the Frets…
The Fiddle Fretter we use has real frets, not just marker lines. Like those tied onto a viola da gamba, the frets on a Fiddle Fretter are thin nylon string that you can barely feel. As seen in the video clip of Ben Dean, you can slide above the frets for a true glissando. Beyond that, the frets provide a distinct advantage when “frame shifting” or playing rhythmic double stops – techniques that are extremely useful when playing “alternative styles.”
Can you be as expressive with frets on a violin?
Yes.  Unlike the guitar that becomes mute when you release pressure in your left hand, the violin does not.   You can play with vibrato, but also choose not to and still play in tune.
What if I want an amplified violin without frets?
No problem. We first recommend that you use the DoSo Violin in several situations for a month or two. Especially when playing in a group with drums or horns, you will find that you are more relaxed playing with frets. You will find that you can play with much less vibrato. If, at the end of two months, you still want an amplified violin without frets, you can remove the Fiddle Fretter leaving no trace that it was ever there."
250,1583901044,"Hey everyone!
My name is George Leakey and I am a wildlife filmmaker (LeakeyStudios), and between April and September next year I will be making a series of short documentaries on some of Africa's most endangered animals, some of which you may be unaware quite how close they are to the brink.
I will look to highlight the issues different animals have facing human conflict, loss of habitat, disease and hunting/poaching, while spending time talking with those who commit their lives to the protection of these species. Those animals will include:
- Trophy Hunting - Fundamental or Detrimental for the African Elephant.
- The pressures and struggles of the African Wild Dog.
My method of filming is modern, using transitions and fast paced music to excite and engage, with use of state of the art technology to tell the story in a different manner to how it has ever been shown before, while making sure the story is central. I find that below BBC NHU and Nat Geo, Wildlife filming is either too subject focused or too cinematography focused, and I want to make sure my films sit in the middle of both.
It will be shown free of charge however the work, time and equipment required for the sort of task, as well as transport means I need all the help I can get. This is something I am truly passionate about, and would love for you to join me on this journey, however not for my sake, but for the sake of those who can't tell their own story. "

 Introducing Sketch Wallet 2.0! Here's what's new:
1. We've heard your requests and have added a full size pen holder to the center of the original size wallet! 
2. We've also changed the pencil holder on the medium size wallet. The elastic lays flat so it will accommodate thinner or fatter drawing tools. The elastic is towards the top to allow your pens to clip on easier. There's also an elastic pocket to keep it from sliding out. Scroll down for a close-up photo.
3. Finally! We've added a leather version of the 7 card slot design. Available in black or brown genuine leather.
4. We've also added a deep red as a new color for the medium wallet and Tahoe Blue in both original and medium size canvas versions. Please note: the Tahoe Blue is only available on Kickstarter for our loyal backers!
This Kickstarter we're trying something a little different by offering a Kickstarter only color. A few years ago we introduced a very limited edition Tahoe Blue color canvas wallet in the original size. We've had a ton of requests to bring it back and so here's your chance to nab one in either size.

255,2122744710,"Chronically Better You has a simple mission: to help patients with chronic disease and mental health challenges live a better life.  
We know this isn’t an easy task to take on. We’re patients, too, and understand how much you’re going through on a daily basis. 
BUT...
Have you ever wondered what it would be like if you were able to make a small change that led to quality of improvements? We know you have - we have too. This is what led us to develop a lifestyle system for those with chronic diseases that is easy to follow and proven to help people reach their goals.  
We spent countless hours studying how some of the most successful and ambitious people in the world spend their time and how they not only reached their goals but exceed them. We learned that these best practices aren’t always possible for chronic disease patients.  
That is where Chronically Better You comes in. We took these best practices and tweaked them then packed them into our Better Life Journal. We’ve developed the first productivity and wellness journal specifically designed for chronic disease patients to organize their lives better and track their mental and physical wellness.
The BIG Better Life Journal features that can change your life:
Periodization - Each journal covers a 13 week period. The concept opf periodization is one commonly used by top athletes and professionals. It allows you to break your goals down into long enough periods of time to make a big change in your life but short enough to not procrastinate. 
Goal Setting - Our system will teach you how to set your big goals and then break them down into more manageable daily tasks. Imagine where you could be if you took one step towards your goal each day?
Tracking - Without tracking your progress you won't know if you're on your way to reaching your goals. Each week there are pages which will help you track what you've done and help you build healthy habits. 
Wellness - Each day you will be able to fill in one physical and mental task you want to complete. This could be listening to a podcast, taking a walk, reading part of a book, playing with your dog, meditating, or training for a half marathon. Whatever you would like them to be. 
Gratitude - The practice of gratitude can change your life. Even when things are hard, we still have to try and find a bright spot. Each morning and night you will practice gratitude which will allow you to start and end your day in a healthy mental space. 
Health Scoring - You will be able to check in 3 times daily to track how you are doing with your disease. Morning, noon, and night you can give yourself a score and take notes. This will lead to figuring out when your power hours are and when your body might not feel well on a regular basis. 
AND MORE!!!!
Better Life Journal
  Our system teaches you how to organize the day, be more efficient with time, track progress, and, most importantly, slowly but effectively change habits. We want to give you a hand in improving daily life and relationships, reducing stress, reaching small milestone goals, and crushing larger long-term milestones.  
Better Life Journal
We’re no quick-fix, but that’s the point. We want to help you make real change in your life - the kind that lasts.  
In the future, we will launch Chronically Better U(niversity), which allows qualified members of our team to more directly teach and lead you in your everyday battles. There’s a whole world out there for you and we want to help you learn tips and secrets so that you can explore it all. Chronically Better U will work alongside our Better Life Journal to do just that.  
So don’t wait! Back our Kickstarter today and take the first step to living a better life and becoming a Chronically Better You."

When are backers charged? If the project you’re backing is successfully funded, your card will be charged when the project reaches its funding deadline. If the project does not reach its funding goal, your card is never charged.
Regarding delivery timeline - The pin art shown in this campaign is designed and ready for manufacture as soon as this campaign closes. We expect production to take 4-6 weeks but have added in another month as a buffer. Shipping will take approximately 1-4 weeks depending on where you live. If you live in a country outside of the UK, we can't control how long pins will take to get to you after we drop the package in the mail. We've seen deliveries in some countries as quickly as one week and others take 3-4 weeks.
Regarding pin design - The pin manufacturing process could alter the designs slightly, but we've done our best to design within enamel pin guidelines so alterations should be minimal.
All pins will be shipped on environmentally friendly backing cards then placed in eco-envelopes. Shipping will be through Royal Mail
Domestic (UK) orders should arrive within 3-5 business days once shipped. International orders will arrive anywhere from 2-8 weeks once shipped. Also, please be aware that International backers are responsible for any taxes or customs fees their country may ask for, so plan accordingly!

  WHAT IS OCCULT GENERATION?
In a nutshell, Occult Generation is a hardboiled sci-fi supernatural graphic novel set in 1920s New York. It's about a private detective who investigates the murder of a notorious drag performer and in the process, uncovers a secret war between remnants of the confederacy equipped with strange technology and a secret society in Harlem that fights for justice through magic.
Gladys Spencer // Harlem Secret Society
The story pulls from memorable elements of the 1920s era while holding a magnifying glass up to people of color, mystics, immigrants, queer life, gender roles, body awareness, political corruption and the dawn of equity feminism. The readers of the graphic novel are going to see blood, violence, sexuality and other Rated-R material, yet it all has a purpose to tell the story. In all of this, we fully get to examine the spectrum of humanity from a unique historical context without having to hold back with our audience.
Artist Sketches by James Zark
Artist Sketches by James Zark
The art of Occult Generation is a collaboration with real life models and actors that play the characters in the story. We do this by casting talent to embody their characters which allows the energy and emotion to shine through each panel. The beauty of having a photorealistic graphic novel is that it gives a type of sex appeal to the visuals that we hope has our audience wanting more as they turn each page. 
OUR MISSION
As creatives, we have a passion to build pathways of communication and this graphic novel series has the potential to set the stage for important conversations in the comic book community and beyond. Occult Generation is a valuable endeavor that can provide an opportunity for controversial topics to stand in the forefront of discussions in society. Though it is set in the 1920s, the parallels to today's world are very apparent. Our intention with this book is to open up more permission to step outside of the box and allow people to find their own answers around the concepts that matter to them (and to have fun doing it!).
Panel from Issue #1 of the graphic novel
OUR TEAM
Our team of top notch creatives are committed to being fearless about their art and communicate about things that are important to them in the world. Without our unique collaborative process, this would not be possible. Throughout the campaign we’ll share the personal stories of our cast and crew so you can get to know our amazing team yourself.
Astroetic Studios in Downtown L.A.
IMMEDIATE GOAL
Production for Chapter 1 (Issue #1) is nearly completed, yet we need the funds for printing/distribution and to start production on the rest of the book. This campaign will cover those printing and distribution costs so we can put physical copies in your hands and prove how awesome Occult Generation can be.
If we are successful in reaching our goal, we will add stretch goals for Chapter 2 and beyond.
Once this campaign is completed successfully, we’ll work to produce what has been funded through this campaign and announce plans to fund the remaining chapters.
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU PLEDGE?
William Derrick III
When you pledge, it goes directly toward production to cover the costs associated with creating, producing, printing and distributing all things Occult Generation. Among them:
renting studio space & equipment 
crew & model fees

printing and distribution of the comic

Don't forget to check out the perks on right hand column!
Here are some examples of what they could look like:
LONG TERM GOAL
Our larger goal is to finish the book in its entirety (over 200 pages) and get it published. 
Eventually, we will continue to move forward working with more artists and writers where we can create stories that matter to people and truly find new perspectives in the entertainment industry. Occult Generation is merely the beginning and there is much more to come!

Our second album is nearly finished! We'll be wrapping up the tracking sessions shortly, and beginning the Mixing and Mastering stage over the next couple months. We are hoping for a late February or early March CD Release party in 2014.
In order to raise the funds to finish the project, we've put together several packages that will offer you advance access to the new recordings, exclusive gifts available only through this Kickstarter campaign, and the opportunity for a direct connection to me and the band. 
The Kickstarter Campaign ends at Midnight on November 12th, but if we reach our goal by Midnight on October 31st, I will make the CD Release Party completely free for everyone! Please encourage everyone to participate early.
I am so grateful for everyone that has supported me throughout the years and I look forward to many more years together. Thank you for making this album possible!
Kickstarter is ""all or nothing."" If we're unable to reach the goal amount by November 12th, then we will not receive any funds and the album is likely to remain unfinished and unheard.
How will the funds be spent?
Recording Studio Balance = $2500 
Mixing at ARC = $1750
Mastering  at Focus Mastering = $600
CD Artwork Design = $200
CD Manufacturing = $1200
Creation of Kickstarter Rewards = $1500
Any funds collected beyond the goal amount will be used for: publicity/promotion, the creation of a music video, production costs for the release party and touring expenses.
If we reach the goal early, this Kickstarter page will still remain active until November 12th. 
All $50-and-up Backers—will get an Autographed CD, an advance download of the album, a signed and handwritten lyric sheet mailed to their house, a professionally recorded download of the Release Concert, an exclusive Kickstarter only T-Shirt and a sticker.

Art, Research, and Communication at the 2010 Shanghai World Expo
The 2010 Shanghai World Expo hosts nearly 200 countries within a 5.28 square kilometer area and is officially recognized as the largest in the 159 year history of World Expositions. Many of the participating countries have created temporary multi-million dollar pavilions to address the theme “Better City, Better Life,” and 70 million visitors from around the world are anticipated to attend between May1st and October 31st.
People In Space is a project organized by American artists from Boston, Massachusetts that utilizes the context of the 2010 Shanghai World Expo as a platform for contemporary art, research, and communication. We see an opportunity to learn from and contribute to this unique event by using our art and inquiry to engage both the people and spaces that define it. Pledges to this project will help us mount an exhibition of our work from Shanghai and the Expo at the Mobius gallery in Boston, MA. Your support will help cover material and logistic expenses associated with the exhibition, receptions and artists talks.
Art:
Approximately 375,000 people attend the Expo each day and many of these visitors will spend over 10 hours waiting in lines consisting of thousands of people in order to enter popular pavilions. With these conditions in mind People In Space has sent out an international call for proposals inviting creative thinkers to submit ideas for actions that engage the waiting visitors in unexpected ways.We have evaluated the proposed actions based on three categories: utilization of the lines, simplicity of design, and strength of concept as it relates to the context of the Expo and its themes. We will implement the selected proposals in and through the lines present at the pavilions as surrogate performers. Artists selected include: Andrew Y. Ames, Jeffery Byrd, James Ellis Coleman, Lewis Gesner, Brian Kane, Heather Kapplow, Alexia Mellor, Michael Oatman, Seth Taylor, Laray Polk, and Julia Wagner. In addition to the projects in lines the People in Space artists on the ground at the Expo will utilize unforeseen contexts as platforms for further artistic actions.
Research:
Our research is intended to provide basic information about the context of the Expo in order to support our art and communication. We have selected three main questions to explore through interviews, direct observations, and the collection of materials available online. What motivates people to attend? How has the Expo organized people and space? What is the most compelling content at the Expo? Using these questions as a starting point to engage visitors, volunteers and organizers we intend to gain insight into the myriad topics associated with the Expo.
Communication
The documentation and relics from People in Space will be contextualized and curated through an exhibition of video, photography, writing and installation at the Mobius gallery in Boston, MA, USA from October 8th - 12th. The exhibition will include opening and closing receptions as well as artists talks throughout that week. Ongoing documentation and blogging for this project will also be present online at: www.BerwickInstitute.org, www.ThePresentTense.org, and www.Mobius.org.

264,848902477,"Mystery Babylon is an original post-apocalyptic comic series unlike any other. Think less ""gritty wasteland"" and more ""ancient Rome with goofy demons and superheroes causing a ruckus.""
It's a dramatic-comedy-fantasy comic which follows the adventures of Kick Girl, an immortal demon with an unpleasant attitude. Along with her for the ride is Zero, a happy-go-lucky priest, and Delilah, the destiny-driven cult leader.
At the end of the Apocalypse, all of the demons were sealed away in The Pit. A conflicted Kick Girl made a promise to the dying hero, J.J., never to break the seal. A promise she kept for the past thousand years...

Mystery Babylon takes a unique twist on mythological themes about the end of the world, and mixes it with a lighthearted and expressive sense of humor. It's a fun-loving adventure comic suited for both young adults and not-so-young adults. If you love angels, demons, superheroes, mythology, constant backstabbing, name-calling, awkward romances, and holy water squirt bottles... then this is the comic for you!
There are currently 8 completed chapters in the series, so support the Kickstarter to see how the adventure began!
At 228 pages, this book will be my biggest printing project to date! Here's a mockup to show how the final printed product might look.
Read Jemma's comic, Children of Eldair! You can also find her on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and Patreon! Big thanks to Jemma for the BEAUTIFUL guest art! I really hope backers will enjoy this free exclusive print! ♥
The goal of this Kickstarter is to raise enough money to print Volume One as a perfect bound, soft cover graphic novel. The book will be 6.5""x10"", 228 pages long, full color, on high quality glossy paper.

If funding is successful, I plan to produce Volume Two next. Volume Two would include Chapters 4 through 8 as well as bonus material. After that, we could continue in the future with Volume Three.

All Kickstarter backers will get a very special thanks on the Kick-Girl.com website, grouped by pledge tier!

How can you help? You can back Mystery Babylon at any level that best fits you. If paperback books aren't for you, we also have a reward for a digital download. All rewards will go directly to the printing costs. You can help us immensely by sharing it everywhere! Sharing by both social media and by word-of-mouth can make all the difference!

It's tough for independent creators to get their work out there, but with Kickstarter, we can print fun new stories without the aid of big publishers. It's all thanks to awesome supporters like you that we can make this one-woman comic a reality!
Val Hochberg (Val Brazier) was born in the freezing cold snows of Buffalo, NY but moved to the burning heat of the Phoenix deserts to pursue a comic career. She is both the writer and artist of Mystery Babylon. She has been working on Mystery Babylon since 2010 and doesn't plan on stopping anytime soon!

You can support her on Patreon and get early access to new comic pages as well as other bonuses!

She really likes Star Wars, Dragon Age, giggling, and her Boosterific husband, Scott.
 A big huge THANK YOU! to everyone who supports the comic. Without you, this book would not be possible. ♥"

CLIP: ""ONE YEAR LATER""

This Kickstarter campaign will expand and update the award-winning 40-minute short documentary, Nefertiti's Daughters — a story of women, art, and revolution — into a feature-length film. All production and filming has been completed, and we are seeking backing to complete the editing and post-production phase by the end of March 2016. 
The original short film began as a successful Kickstarter project less than two years ago, which provided funding for us to travel to Cairo, Egypt in April 2014 for 11 days of production. In 2015, Nefertiti's Daughters saw its World Premiere at the prestigious Aspen Shortsfest, won the Grand Jury prize at the Athens International Film Festival, has since been accepted to 16 festivals, and acquired by Icarus Films, a top documentary distributor.
Events on the ground in post-revolutionary Egypt deteriorated since we filmed in 2014, with a repressive military regime back in firm control after it overthrew a democratically-elected government, and rolled-back the hard-fought gains of the Revolution. As a result, there was a tremendous need to update and expand the short into a fully-formed feature-length film, and the original 40-minute short has provided us with a clear proof of concept, given how the film strongly resonated around the world. 
""Three stories intersect in this compelling short film from director Mark Nickolas: the emergence of Egyptian street art, the oppression of women in the country, and the revolution that toppled President Hosni Mubarak but didn't stop government brutality against Egyptians."" —Aspen Times
THE STORY
Nefertiti's Daughters is a feature-length documentary film that spotlights women, art, and revolution, and documents the critical role that revolutionary street art played—and continues to play—during the political uprisings since the 2011 Egyptian Revolution.
Following the ouster of long-time ruler Hosni Mubarak, when millions of Egyptians took to Tahrir Square for 18 days in early 2011 to express their demands for “bread, freedom, and social justice,” an even more repressive military regime under current President (and former Army general) Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has been the subject of growing international alarm.
Beyond Sisi's merciless efforts to crush any oppositional artistic expression — including street art — his regime has been condemned around the world for its increasing use of sexual violence as a political tool against his own people, as well as the accelerated targeting of journalists who are simply trying to do their job and shine light on the actions of the government.
The film introduces a group of courageous, gifted, and internationally-acclaimed female artists and activists, who are deeply involved in the struggle for social and political justice, and illustrates the surprising ways that artwork can become a powerful tool in the ongoing fight for civil and human rights. As the artists speak of their work, and the ways that it is inspired by and responds to a violent and complicated political environment, we are offered a rare window into the struggles of living and creating in Egypt today. 
Through this film, we witness how the revolutionary street art coming out of the Revolution served many functions: memorializing acts of government brutality; calling potential comrades into the struggle; turning the tables on male predators and sexism; and even imagining a world where a woman would be permitted to sing the sacred Adhan, the Muslim call for prayer.
We also learn how street art has long been a key means of communication and dissent during times of political transformation and social instability. Techniques, styles and symbols from Egyptian history are re-appropriated and adapted to become relevant today—including the image of the legendary Queen Nefertiti, a powerful symbol in an ongoing fight for justice.
THE STATUS OF THE FILM
All production for the feature-length version of Nefertiti's Daughters has been completed and we have already begun shifting all efforts into the final editing and post-production phase.
We remain confident that we will be ready to submit to film festivals by Spring 2016, with a specific target of meeting the March submission deadline for the 2016 Cannes Film Festival.
THE FILMMAKERS
Filmmakers Mark Nickolas and Elizabeth Van Meter come to this collaboration following significant award-winning accomplishments with their most recent films.
ELIZABETH VAN METER (Producer and Co-Director)
Elizabeth's first feature-length documentary film, Thao's Library (2015), recently won the Audience Choice Award at the inaugural Bentonville Film Festival, which actress Geena Davis specifically created to spotlight women and diversity in film. As a result, Elizabeth was awarded a week long nationwide theatrical run in AMC theaters in 20 cities across the United States and a distribution deal that will sell Thao's Library in Wal-Mart stores throughout the country, as well as video-on-demand on VUDU. 
Elizabeth's previous documentary work has taken her from the Andes Mountains of Peru to the Tohoku region of Japan (Hand in Hand, Lincoln Center 2014). She also directed and produced 40 short films for Gorgeous Entertainment documenting the lives of Japanese-Americans.
Elizabeth is a graduate of the University of North Carolina School of the Arts. 
MARK NICKOLAS (Director and Producer)
Prior to the accolades received for the 40-minute version of Nefertiti's Daughters, Mark earned considerable national media coverage from NPR, CNBC, and The Atlantic for his first short documentary film, My Life in the Canyon of Heroes (2013), a Smithsonian magazine finalist, which had its theatrical premiere at the Vancouver International Film Festival.
Before moving into documentary filmmaking, Mark was a long-time veteran of national Democratic politics, most notably as an aide to Vice President Al Gore and later managed a number of gubernatorial and congressional campaigns across the country before becoming a prominent figure in the political media world, and eventually entering the filmmaking world. 
Mark earned his bachelor's degree from the University of California at Berkeley, and his master's degree in Media Studies and Film from The New School in New York City.
Both filmmakers live in New York City.
THE FUNDS
Filmmaking is not an inexpensive endeavor and funds for independent documentaries are in short supply. Your donations will allow us to fully finish this film, which involves these specific things:
editing: hire a seasoned documentary editor to work with the filmmakers. 
composer/music: hire a composer for an original film score. 
sound design + sound mix: hire a sound designer and sound engineer to complete the final audio work.
color correction/mix: hire a colorist to correct and refine the film visuals. 
reimburse production costs: reimburse the costs of filming and travel-related expenses for the additional feature-length production.
license footage/materials + rights: allow us to acquire rights and licenses to use footage and images for the final film.
film festival submissions: allow us to pursue an aggressive film festival campaign (75-100 submissions), with festival submission fees running between $35 and $75 for each.
transfer/DCP conversion: convert finished film into a digital format for theatrical screening.
key art design: costs associated with creating the film poster, post cards, DVD and Blu-ray covers, and the electronic press kit.
printing: printing costs for DVDs, Blu-rays, posters, and post cards. 
E&O insurance + legal + accounting: administrative expenses to legally complete the film.
Kickstarter rewards: though we were careful to create great rewards for our donors, we were also cost-conscious in making sure that they accounted for a reasonable portion of the overall budget to create, acquire and ship to you.
THE COMMUNITY
Anything you can do to help our project is so incredibly appreciated. We are grateful for every contribution, Tweet, Facebook post, and words of support and encouragement! We are not here simply to raise money — as important as fundraising is. Kickstarter has shown itself to be a way for filmmakers to build communities, bringing together people who feel invested and are active participants in our creative work — this one — and those that we will continue to make. We hope you'll be with us for journeys to come.
This is a story that the world needs to know about. Thank you for taking the time to consider our project. We hope you will join us on this amazing journey.
Best, Elizabeth and Mark"
266,878378886,"Apathy and negative stigmas affect the 1.56 million homeless in the united states (one in two hundred people), and the purpose of Hearts Without Homes is to humanize those experiencing homelessness. While helpful nonprofits like Breaking Ground (http://www.breakingground.org/) are combating the problem, the movement in the political area is frustrating. Oftentimes great ideas are bogged down in bureaucracy and the homeless are swept under the political rug. 
Hearts without Homes is a interview/mini-doc with the aims to: 
1. Humanize those that are homeless
2. Inspire real and actual change in the political sphere
3. Provide each interviewed person that is homeless with a care package of living essentials such as clothes, food, water, as well as an informational pamphlet to help them get back on their feet. 
Homeless people are just fellow human beings that were faced with unfortunate circumstances or have hit hard times. They're just hearts without homes.
Interview/Mini-Doc Specifics:
Have Hope founder, Andrew Ooi, will be working with filmmakers Jordan Hill, Seth Gleckman, and Erica Armenta to interview those that are homeless, with a special way to show their humanity. We will be asking them ""If you could make any change in the world happen, what would it be?"" The goal is to see what global change someone with nothing would wish for: an exploration of the empathy and humanity of those who rarely receive any themselves. 
With the money raised from this Kickstarter, we will create care packages filled with clothes, food, water, and a blanket for homeless citizens in San Diego. "

268,1621860068,"""Dogs and Bobcats"" is a short documentary, produced by The Creature Show, about bobcat conservation in New Jersey. Your support will help us finish the film.
Q&A:
Why is there a dog?
Bear is a wildlife detection dog who is helping New Jersey biologists conduct a bobcat population study. (Bobcats are an endangered species in New Jersey.) The goal of the study is to create a baseline estimate of how many bobcats are left in the state.
What else is the story about?
Our story is about:
-Major threats to bobcats in New Jersey, including highways (they're hard to cross) and habitat fragmentation (bobcats prefer large spaces to roam.)
-An initiative called ""Bobcat Alley,"" led by The Nature Conservancy's New Jersey Chapter, to connect bobcat habitat in Northwest Jersey. 
-Ideas about how to help bobcats and other creatures cross highways more safely. 
When will you be finished?
We hope to release ""Dogs and Bobcats"" by the end of 2017.
What is The Creature Show?
The Creature Show is an ongoing series of short films about threatened and endangered species in New Jersey. ""Dogs and Bobcats"" is the fifth installment of the series. You can watch past episodes at www.creatureshow.com.
What if you raise more money than your goal?
If we raise more than our goal, we'll be excited to put the funding toward future episodes of The Creature Show, including an upcoming episode about Pine Barrens tree frogs.
 Special Thanks
A special thank you to the groups and people who have participated in or supported ""Dogs and Bobcats"" to date, including The Nature Conservancy of New Jersey, New Jersey Conservation Foundation, the New Jersey Division of Fish & Wildlife Endangered and Nongame Species Program, and Carla Lee Lewis and family."

In just four days, we met the goal. If you still would like to be a part of this project, any further donations will make this film even better and go towards making more projects like this possible.
Disability is a spectrum. Shouldn’t there be equally diverse tools available to people who live with them?
I'm always on the hunt for anything that can help me live the lifestyle I want. Because of a connective-tissue disorder, I have a difficult time walking distances but that doesn't keep me from snowboarding, rock climbing, or skateboarding. I just have a hard time getting to the adventure. 
Typically, the only mobility devices are wheelchairs and mobility scooters. I can either pay a ridiculous amount of money for some giant device I didn't completely need, just push through the exhaustion and soreness, or not go at all. 
I knew there had to be a better option. Physical ability is not as simple as walking or a wheelchair. Disability is a spectrum and there should be a diverse range of tools available to people who live with them, not just scooters and chairs. 
ASSISTED MOBILITY is a documentary film about redefining the idea of a “mobility device.” 
First, I reached out to an electric longboard company, Inboard Technology, and they sent me a beta version of their brand new M1 electric board. I already felt comfortable on a skateboard, so I thought their device might be the perfect fit for me. 
Next, I grabbed a camera and my friend, Jason, and we headed down to San Francisco to see what this board could really do. I figured that if I really want to know how well the board fits my needs, I have test it out in the widest range of situations possible. What better way to do that than going to a strange city with only a backpack and a skateboard?
In ASSISTED MOBILITY, I look at issues of practicality, individuality, and community. I investigate how people with disabilities could find a solution in-between walking and wheelchairs. I talk to experts about how new technology can empower individuals who have previously been restricted by old-fashioned ideas of ""mobility devices.”
The film also covers how the board fits into my everyday life as a film student in Provo, Utah. 
Most of the filming is now complete and I’ve started the editing process. I need your help to push this project through post-production and out into the world. I don't need much. Just enough to cover costs like music licensing and festival submission fees, as well as help to offset some of the travel expenses I've already incurred.
A significant amount of time and resources have been volunteered already. I'm grateful for Brent, who let us stay in his beautiful North Beach apartment, and the team at Inboard, who graciously lent us two of their M1 electric longboards."

Virtual reality is finally emerging as an accessible medium. I am creating an experience that will take us back to the birth of photography, the medium that spawned all subsequent image-based technological innovations.
 I am committed to making this experience as accesible as possible and currently have four venues around the country lined up for 2017. I would like to make entry as little as possible, so am appealing to your generosity to help make this happen.
An early rendering of the virtual room
The installation I am producing will be a portal to the past. It will place you inside the 1839 exhibition where you will see the artefacts and touch the cases that housed them. I will build an actual room with simple structures inside that tally geometrically with the objects you view virtually in your headset.
Actual room build
The purpose of these are to give you the illusion that you are touching the simulated objects in the virtual world. This is a relatively untapped area in VR and one that makes for a uniquely uncanny experience.
Your hand touching the vitrine
Ghost-like auras will indicate the presence of other guests to prevent collisions and enhance the sensation of time-travel.
Ghost like avatars and virtual firepace
A fire will crackle in the fireplace and you will feel its heat as you approach. Various technical innovations from the period will be on display in the glass vitrines.
CG recreation of the Wilmhurst Static Electricity Machine
In amongst them are the early works of Henry Fox Talbot.
Outside the actual room other visitors will wait to gain entry. Rectangular holes in the walls will enable them to look inside at the other guests as they explore the exhibition.
View from outside VR room
These holes are synchronised with paintings hanging on the walls of the virtual room and will simply form part of the décor to those wearing the headset.
View from inside VR room
There will be alternate levels of reality and unreality. This is a virtual reality of a virtual reality of reality.
We have four venues lined up for our tour: Photo London at Somerset House in May, Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery in June, Lacock Abbey in September, and National Media Museum Bradford in November.

We are developing the project with Paul Tennant at Nottingham University Mixed Reality Lab (part of their computer Science department), VMI Studio and The White Wall Company in London. The Mixed Reality Lab are developing the movement detection side of the project while VMI Studio are recreating our VR room in CG. The White Wall Company will be building the actual room. Work has been underway since January 2016 and we are now moving into the final phase. My partners on Thresholds are Pete James (a photographic historian), Larry Schaaf (an authority on Talbot), Paul Tennant (of Nottingham University Mixed Reality Lab), VMI Studio, The Science Museum, The British Library, The Royal Institution, The King Edward Grammar School, Lacock Abbey and The National Media Museum Bradford. 
The project has been kindly supported finacially by King Edward's School, Birmingham, The Schools of King Edward VI in Birmingham, Colmore Business District, Birmingham City University and The Art Fund.
Talbot's early production line
  The English photographer Henry Fox Talbot showed his early experiments in photography in an exhibition of cutting edge science in 1839 at the King Edward's School, Birmingham. These photographs are now impossible to see as Talbot had not by then resolved the process for fixing his prints and they have thus faded with time.

273,1683349058,"Why We're Doing This:
As you may know Cloud Party are an original rock/Americana band from the Philly/Reading PA area.  We've just finished the recording of our new--and long awaited, fifth album, The Dying Art of Living.  Feel free to watch the dorky video above for more info, or just keep reading!
Here's a song, ""Shadow of an Angel,"" from our third album, Real: 
So you may be asking, if the recording is done, why does Cloud Party need funding? And since Cloud Party has released four other albums, why are they using a Kickstarter campaign for this one?  Good questions!
The first is easier to answer.  The recording IS done, but there's a lot more to releasing an album than the recording.  Normally a record label does all this stuff for us, but the label that released our last album is no longer viable so we're doing all this on our own--the actual pressing of CDs, cover art, graphic design, photos and more.  Without this investment, you can't hold that physical product in your hands!  We've already shelled out some $4000 on the recording, so now is not the time to scrimp on the final product.
The second answer is kind of implied by the answer to the first question.  It's been six years (hard to believe!) since the last Cloud Party album--six years of struggle, for various reasons which we need not go into here.  One of those things, though, was essentially losing what label support we had.  
Also, times have changed!  There's this neato thing called the Internet and things get done on the Internet.  So, with that idea in mind, what better way to announce to the world that Cloud Party is back than to invite you guys to participate in the album itself through Kickstarter? Not only that, but because people will be sort of pre-ordering, we'll have a better idea of how many CDs we'll need. This way, you get to be a part of the party, the album gets done and the word gets out to everyone.
If we happen to raise more money than what's needed for final pressing (about $2500.00 all told) we'll use said cash to promote the heck out of this album and get the word out on radio, magazines, newspapers, the Internet, heck, Rolling Stone. Whatever it takes!  
If you'd like to learn more about the history of Cloud Party, who we are now, and more about The Dying Art of Living, then just continue reading.  Don't be afraid to check out some of the pictures throughout as well as click on links to video and some music.
Cloud Party was formed by me, Jim Speese, with Mark Steffy ""back in the day."" It has since released four albums and played all over. (We've had some really fun gigs--you've probably been at some.)
Mark and Jim at at gig at Bistro 614, April 10, 2013
The band presently consists of Jim (vocals, guitar) and Mark (lead guitar) and Kevin Adams (drums). Plus newcomers Evelyn Christian (keys/vocals) and Gerry Ronning (bass/guitar) not to mention the occasional appearance by former Zoo Boy, Keith Smoker (bass.)
I have to say  that the band has been my alter-ego for over a decade now, allowing me to express myself as a (musical) artist.  And Mark Steffy is what makes the musical engine run. As you can hear with some of our music, Mark's guitar can be captivating.  Click below to hear Mark's guitar solo which opens the song ""The Mansion on the Hill"" from the album Real.  
The Dying Art of Living:
Believe it or not, the album's title comes from an off-hand line in the oldest of the songs on the album.
Jim on the AT back in the day . . .
I wrote the song ""Alive"" when I was hiking on the Appalachian Trail in 1991.  Hiking on the AT (for three months) was the most magical time of my life.  Every painful but sublime step confirmed that I was impossibly alive.  In that song, I imagined a far distant future when I'd possibly forgotten these moments, and wished my future self a memory in song.  I wrote the lyrics and music in my head as I hiked 2 miles for a Coke (the things you do on the AT!)  Fast forward to now. 
Rediscovering the song ""Alive"" as Cloud Party tried to find a ""personality"" or theme to the new recording was like reconnecting to an old friend.  I really felt as if I had been contacted by my younger self.  It was a reminder about life, in more ways than one. I've found that my writing tends to be about trying to hold onto the magical moments of life, about lost memories and moments.  So it fit right into an album about loss and life.
Click below to hear Mark and Jim play an acoustic version of ""Stay Away from My Heart"" (which appears on the new album) live in the studios of radio station WBZH in Pottstown:
I should note that the album is also FUN! ""The Superhero Song"" is about my life-long dream (""I wanna be Spiderman""--you hear that, Phil?)  Some songs, like ""Making Out With Kate"" (which we'd been playing for years but had never formally recorded) we added by request (Sara, this means YOU!)  I think that title speaks for itself.
(Click the link below for an ancient video of Cloud Party playing ""Making Out with Kate.""  I should note the song has changed a lot since then--and the version of CP here is an entirely different band, save for Jim and Mark.)
Cloud Party also finally recorded its first full-bore electric blues song, ""These Blues"" for The Dying Art of Living. There's also ""Sad Eyed Rose,""  an acoustic song, on this album. Click below to hear Mark and Jim playing ""Sad Eyed Rose"" live in the studios of radio station WBZH in Pottstown.
Some songs also touch on more recent travels, including magical trips to places like The Island of the Sun in Lake Titicaca (""Waiting All This Time."")
Sunset on The Island of the Sun
Of course, I'm not the only one doing this stuff. One of the songs, for instance, is called ""Gone"" and is mostly Gerry's meditation on moral responsibility (though, frankly,  it reminds me of The Clash.) Evelyn's contribution on vocals and keyboards is integral to the sound of the record (I still call them records) and Kevin's drumming is really freaking good.
The album ends with a little lullaby (""Dreamland"") Mark and I wrote for our friend Kirsten's daughter, Julia, shortly after she was born.  And she's almost a teenager now . . . man, this album is a long time coming.
All in all The Dying Art of Living will feature 13 relatively ""new"" Cloud Party songs.  I've listed the songs at the end of this history--feel free to skip ahead and check out the titles.  Also, the album features some guest stars, including singer Alisa B and Max Watkins who played cello on a couple songs.
The History of The Dying Art of Living:
We started recording this album AGES ago . . . but things happened.  In fact, not once, but twice, we began to record demos for the songs that would eventually be on this album, but, in the midst of the project, the studio(s) closed down (for reasons that had nothing to do with us--we swear.)  Each time that happened, it set us back about a year. In addition, several members of Cloud Party moved on to other projects (we miss you Joe and Chris) and things just got really busy.  Click here to hear a really early demo of ""Before I Sleep"" recorded in one of those other studios:
Enter Rich Bickel.  Rich had a studio in Collegeville.  I happened to know Rich's aunt, and one day (or night, more likely, with a libation) I complained about how I couldn't find the right studio, and she told me all about Rich's place. It sounded awfully familiar.  Turns out it was!  We had recorded our second album, everything and nothing, there with Tom Volpicelli and Joe Mattis. Rich had apparently bought the studio from Joe and Tom.  (Man, this is getting complicated.)
Rich in his element
Anyway, turns out Rich is a great producer and an even greater guy. It also turns out he loved our music, so it was a match made in heaven.  
(Most of) the band in the studio. Kevin is behind the glass in the studio; Control room from L-R is Gerry, Jim, Keith, Mark
That said, it took us well over a year to finish the album.  Just to tie this story all together in a neat bow, Tom Volpicelli visited us a few times (to see his old studio) and he's mastering the project at The Mastering House (his business, since the studio was sold.)
Whew!  That's quite the story.  So you see, this is not just an album for us.  It's more of a crazy journey.  We are so excited to finish this album and get it out.  I can't wait until it's in your hands too!
Jim, Mark and Evelyn
Oh, and just a quick shout-out to graphic artist Jay Kunkel for being kind enough to do some work on the graphics pro-bono before we use Kickstarter--the cool image at the top of this page is taken from the album artwork that he's working on.  He also filmed and edited the video above.  Among the pluses if this thing gets financed is that he gets paid!
Cloud Party (L-R: Kevin, Jim, Mark Keith, Evelyn, Gerry)
Also thanks to Chad DeShazo for the band photos. You rock.
A secondary goal of $4,000 will mean some extensive touring for the band and lots and lots of promotion . . .

274,1687340827,"The Black Arrow calendar will help raise funds towards building a full scale replica of the Black Arrow rocket at High Down, on the Isle of Wight. The Black Arrow rockets first began production in 1966, with 5 rockets being produced in total, the replica model will celebrate the rockets 50th anniversary in 2016.
The Black Arrows were tested at High Down in the late 60's before being shipped to Australia for launch from the Woomera rocket range.
Black Arrow rocket undergoing qualification testing
The rocket programme was cancelled in 1971 but most of the infrastructure remains in place & Highdown is now open to the public & thousands visit the site each year.
The full scale replica will give visitors to High Down as sense of the scale of the rockets tested there & hopefully inspire the next generation.
The calendar will be an opportunity to own 12 of the original artworks created by Rich Curtis for the 2016 celebrations. Each image will be approximately A4 in size rendered at 300dpi to give the best print quality on the easy to use, fold-out booklet style calendars. ( A3 in size when you include the date section & hung up ).
This includes one of the most detailed computer graphics of the Black Arrow rocket ever created as well as a range of dramatic flight sequence graphics showing the rocket on its journey into space.
Flight Sequence Graphic
The target of £450 is to cover the cost of having the smallest bulk print run of calendars produced, we need to sell just 30 to achieve this but the more we sell the the bigger the print run & the more money we can raise towards the project.
The aim is for at least £8.00 from each calendar sold will go towards creating the 50th anniversary display at High Down. The more funds we can raise the better the replica will be.
We have various options on how to create the replica rocket dependent on the funds raised from a low cost 2D display board to an inflatable version, but the main hope is to have the replica professionally built on the Isle of Wight, making use of the manufacturing companies we have.
So as well as supporting this fab project you will also be supporting a range of existing jobs & skills.
 Many thanks again for your support and getting rocket ready for 2016.

Cherry-veen Zine is Kristen Levine and Paige Walter, two Philly locals with a passion for music and a knack for friendship. As two regular concert-goers in the community, Kristen and Paige saw a need to document the ever-evolving music scene in Philadelphia. Since then, they've been broadcasting the achievements of local bands through a print zine, or miniature DIY magazine. 
The zine quickly became an authority on local music; recent accomplishments include partnerships with a local record label and media company, exhibiting at First Friday events, and being interviewed for the podcast Show Me Your Playlist. At shows, Kristen and Paige are recognized for their place in the community as journalists and avid music consumers, always eager to participate in new music. 
Attending a soft opening of a cafe in Fishtown
The artists featured in the zine are offered a unique opportunity to tell their story and give insight into their craft. More than ever, featured artists are being recognized by fans not only for their music, but also for their presence in the zine. On social media, CVZ promotes shows around town, and has proven to bump attendance at shows. CVZ's influence around Philadelphia is becoming undeniable, and is only continuing to grow.
A picture of the most recent issue taken by a featured artist
With Kickstarter contributions, the zine can afford to print more copies and expand its distribution network. CVZ has goals to distribute far beyond its home neighborhood of Fishtown and into coffee shops and music venues across the city. Recently, Paper Scissors Media offered to distribute the zine to as many as 20 shows a month, an incredible opportunity that CVZ could pursue with the help of Kickstarter contributions. 
Cherry-veen zine is a proven authority in the community with an established network of fans and partners--all that's missing is the funding to continue to grow. CVZ thanks you in advance for any contribution so that it may continue to serve the Philly music scene and bring joy to the community.

277,1288121081,"We are asking for financial help in order to finish our first full length album, which will be a mixture of original and traditional folk music on fiddle, guitar and vocals. There will be both songs and instrumental tunes. We have been playing together for two years, working up material that satisfies both of our hungry musical brains while enjoying a fluid creative process. We feel it is past time to set down the fruits of our labors on a record. A number of singular artists both old and new have inspired us. To name a few: Andy Irvine, Alasdair Fraser, Nic Jones, Martin Hayes, Dick Gaughan, Andre Brunet, and Nightingale. A common thread between these artists is their ability to thrive on playing old music with their own voice, to deliver their own version of these timeless songs and tunes. Like them, we're trying to build on the depth of this material by adding our own layers to what is already there, and adding our own story to the mix.
We’ve both made albums in recent years with other bands and projects, but this one is of particular importance because it will be a big step towards defining our sound together. We hope this album will be the first of many, and help us further refine our partnership. For this album we are working with Jim Prendergast at Mill Pond Music Studios in Portsmouth NH. Jim has quietly been creating many amazing records in the past five years, and we trust his ability to interpret our music. He is definitely the man to help us push this album forward. We also made an easy decision to invite the incredible Jeremiah McLane to join us as a guest on this album, playing accordion. He has paved the way for us with some of the singular recordings he has made in the past, and he is a huge inspiration to both of us. His presence on this recording will not only add color but a huge amount of depth that we could not achieve without him. 
 We're hoping that, in the end, both traditional and contemporary tastes in music will be satisfied when listening to this album, but we need your support to get there."

Since the move, I've created a great networking foundation of industry colleagues who are interested in my ideas, however, the first step to the campaign is content building. Upon manifesting my companies, I am now in the stages of building the campaign for the brand which entails a musical and visual project under my brand ""The Frequency Chemist"" and ""CNJ Creations LLC.""

279,688939259,"What is the money for?
I am raising funds to build a website that will allow people to review home builders in their area. 

Why am I doing this?
To influence and educate future buyers.

What will the website look like?
A simple site where people can write reviews on a builder. The home screen will show the list of builders in the given area in a grid format (see attachment). Each builder will show; an overall score from the reviews people have posted, how many projects are currently under construction, and ready to move in houses. When you click on a builder, it will bring you to their profile page. The builder profile page will show a breakdown of their overall score and any reviews people have posted (see attachment). However, these reviews will have the option of being vetted or unvetted. Vetted reviews will have to send proof showing they did in fact use the builder. After the review has been posted, an email will be sent to the builder asking if they would like to comment on anything the review has said. This way each side gets to state their story. Outsiders will also be able to comment on the reviews to ensure every voice is heard. A home purchase is most likely the biggest financial decision some can make. The more informed the easier the decision comes.
Home Screen Example
Builder Profile Example
Reviews Example

The reason behind the why?
If you have ever built a house or know someone who has, chances are they wanted to pull their hair out on multiple occasions. This is typical; however, what’s not typical is getting the legal process involved because the builder is doing anything they can to cut corners. I want to give future buyers a better explanation of what to look out for when choosing a builder and hopefully save people from losing their entire life's savings (as you will read later on).

My personal why?
The cost of living is very reasonable in my area. Take that and combined it with cheap labor and enormous growth from the surrounding cities you get a builder’s market. It is actually hard to keep track of all the builders in the area because there always seems to be new ones.
When my wife and I decided it would be better for us to build rather than buy a house, we tried to narrow down which builder was right for us. After seeing countless open houses from multiple builders, we finally decided on one. We did as much research as we could to ensure we are making the right choice. He wasn’t the cheapest but he wasn’t the most expensive. It was a happy medium and the open house he showed us looked spectacular. We only found one review on the builder stating “stay away”. We asked the builder about the review but he said not to worry because whoever it was didn’t build with him. Since the site gave no option of trying to contact the reviewer, we decided to trust the builder. To this point he gave us no reason not to. He was very professional in how he presented himself and his company. Overall, we thought we had made a great choice and couldn’t be more excited.
The excitement faded as the construction process went on and the great choice, we thought we had made in our builder completely deteriorated. First it stared out small with project deadlines not being met, then it escalated to workers not getting paid by the builder so proposed liens were sent to us. We knew the builder was getting paid because we were signing the checks the bank made out to the builder on each draw request. When this was brought to his attention, he said it was a misunderstanding. 
My wife and I both work but we still were at the house every day to check on the progress and answer any question or help in anyway. This started to seem like a have-to rather than a want-to. Walls, doorways, electrical, etc. were being built not according to plans. We were constantly trying to get in touch with the project manager or owner to notify them of what was happening but they were mostly unavailable. The owner and project manager started lying about different things that were supposedly done on the house. For example:
· The vapor barrier was not installed but they reassured us it us it was. We had them remove the brick to show us it was there and long behold there was nothing. A ton of brick had to be removed to put the vapor barrier in.
· They tried to install regular insulation instead of the spray foam insulation and cover it up with drywall before we could see it. We had to show them a copy of the contract to get them to honor it. 
· They installed wrong counter tops (they switched them out later on). 
· Plumbing problems with the shower not draining due to incorrect plumbing fixtures.
· Secondary drain for AC was plumbed to drain into attic (soffit) rather than outside.
· The list could go on and on. 
It got down to the point of me taking pictures and making Power Point illustrations of what had to be done. On each picture it would have arrows pointing to different places showing what the issue was and what needed to be corrected. It seems silly but it appeared to be working. The relationship between the builder and us deteriorated over time because we were constantly on them. We were not trying to be a difficult customer by any means. We just wanted to make sure we were getting what we paid for.
As this process went on, I found out I was not the only one having multiple issues with this builder. Turns out everyone who we found that was currently building with this builder were all having similar problems. After we all got to together, we proposed legal action against the builder if he did not correct the issues. Slowly, we all got our houses completed but even now (a year after construction) we’re still trying to fight to get small things around the house taking care. At this point we all believe we’re on our own as we keep getting the run around from the builder. 
My wife and I now understand just because the model house we saw looked fantastic doesn’t mean the quality is there. We could only imagine what the quality of our house would have been like had we not been there each day. I believe this builder and others like him will continue to cut as many corners as possible to maximizes their profits unless people know.
To help this problem, I thought it would be beneficial to make a review website that strictly rates home builders. There are a ton of review websites but when it comes to home builders, there needs to be a reputable easy to use site that will show both sides of the story. The client and the builder can review each other so the potential future buyers will have an informed decision when it comes time to choose.
I have been working on a website through Wix to review builders but there seems to be too many limitations. I want people to give good honest reviews and not have to worry about the character count in a review or if they can post pictures/videos. I want the layout to navigate easy without set boundaries and limitations on what can or can’t go. After weeks of trial and error on the Wix website, a friend sent me a link to a builder who was charged for stealing over $400,000 of unfinished work from clients. https://www.krgv.com/news/home-builder-arrested-for-stealing-over-400-000-of-unfinished-work/ This builder turns out to be the brother of my builder with his own construction company. If only I had the review website up and running, I could have saved people like this from losing their life’s saving. Now the urgency is on to get a great review website up and running. It makes more sense to create the website on WordPress because I will not be limited to what I can or can’t have. The problem is, I don’t know a lot about WordPress and the months it will take for me to learn and hopefully get the website up and running is months builders will have to get other people.
The money I am requesting will be used to hire outside help in building the website. I've already posted a job on Upwork's website seeking qualified applicants as I'm familiar with Upwork’s process from previous experience. The break down for the budget would allow $3,000 for the website creation, $1,000 for marketing, and $800 for web hosting services, updates and bug fixes (for at lest the first two years).
Overall I do believe this website will help save people money, time, frustration and best of all make an informed decision on which builder to use.
Even if you do not donate, I want to thank you for taking them time in reading this and hope it will help you in the future."

This is going to be a project that is entirely funded by Kickstarter, and worked on by a team of local writers, producers, and actors. It is going to be filmed on location in Kingston, Ontario, and hopefully premiered at local venues. All actors (except reward winners) will be found through a local casting call, and the film will be available through digital download.
I have started drawing up the storyboards, as well as contacting a couple writer's that I know, to get the ball rolling, so now all I need is you guys.
It may seem like a strange thing to do, ask people you don't know for money, but it is people like you that make the YouTube world, and the independent movie, music, and art world go round.
Also, because all rewards are digital, there will be no awkward waiting period, where you have to wonder if they are on their way. Once the film is released, all rewards will have been delivered.

281,501195398,"Open Movement is a dance school and company that has been a part of the Vaud cultural scene since 2016. For its founder, Paolo Giglio, dance is much more than a discipline, it is an art, an incredible and infinite communication tool. The philosophy he has developed is based on freedom of movement, transdisciplinarity and the act of sharing. He favours self-development, encouraging self-confidence as well as confidence in others. This community is a source of inspiration since today's society is gradually leading towards individual isolation. This is why Paolo seeks to use dance to break this cycle by helping rebuild the channels of communication between people and within oneself. Coordination and musicality are both tools to forge a link between us and everything around us.@
The body speaks a special language and it has things to tell us, so listen, watch, share ...
The building that you see in the video, (Les Ateliers de La Côte) is a new cultural center. It is going to be a hot spot not just for artists to create their work but also a place they can share and perform their art with the global community. With Open Mouvement, we aim to connect not only with children but with people of all ages who share the love of dance. To make this dream come true, we will need your support to promote and spread the word about Open Mouvement.
We would greatly appreciate any contribution possible. Your support will not only help bring this project forward but it will encourage to build a greater sense of community through the magical art of dance. Please help us to make this project possible. We look forward to sharing Open Mouvement with you soon!

Pour son fondateur, Paolo Giglio, la danse est bien plus qu’une discipline, c’est un art, un outil de communication incroyable et infini. La philosophie qu’il a su développer est basée sur la liberté de mouvement, la transdisciplinarité et le partage. Il privilégie le développement de soi qui passe dans la confiance en soi mais également dans la confiance envers les autres. Le collectif est source d’inspiration. En effet, notre société amène peu à peu l’individu à s’isoler.

Ce bâtiment que vous voyez dans la vidéo, ( Les Ateliers de la Côte) est le tout nouveau centre culturel de la région d'Etoy. Il va être amener à devenir le rendez-vous et le point de rencontre privilégié des artistes non seulement dans leur travail de création mais également un endroit de partage et un espace dédié à la pratique de l'art au sein d' une communauté interdisciplinaire et diversifiée.
Au sein d'Open Mouvement, notre objectif principal sera de partager notre amour de la danse non seulement avec les enfants mais avec des personnes de tout âge et de tout horizon. Pour que ce rêve devienne réalité, nous sollicitons votre soutien pour promouvoir et partager le concept Open Mouvement. Nous désirons pouvoir créer et consolider avec chacun de vous des partenariats durables et construire une grande communauté vivante, culturelle et dynamique autour de l'art magique de la danse!
Nous appelons chacun d'entre vous à faire partie de ce grand projet et de le rendre possible. Nous attendons avec impatience de vous rencontrer et de pouvoir partager avec vous Open Mouvement!

285,1695614770,"Who are The Radiators From Space?
Then The Radiators From Space came out, ""Television Screen"", which was a great single, that was a real inspiration to us."" (Bono, U2)
Dublin band The Radiators from Space are best known for their debut single ""Television Screen"" and for their legendary second album Ghostown. ""Television Screen"" was hailed by Rolling Stone as the best of the first batch of UK punk singles and was also the first punk single to place Top 20 anywhere in the world when it charted at No 17 in Ireland in April 1977. Ghostown, an exotic fantasia of a midnight walk around Dublin which seems to take place simultaneously in the 1970s and six decades earlier, has consistently featured in the lists of Best Irish Albums of All Time since it was recorded 35 years ago.
But that's not all there is to The Radiators. There's their debut album TV Tube Heart, widely considered a punk classic, and their stunning reunion album from 2006, Trouble Pilgrim. In the intervening years guitarist Philip Chevron found fame with The Pogues, Steve Averill became one of the music world's top designers and has been involved with the artwork for U2 from the very beginning, while Pete Holidai received the Hot Press/Smithwicks award for his work as a record producer.
What is Sound City Beat?
Sound City Beat is a tribute by The Radiators From Space to the Irish rock bands and beat groups of the 1960s who tenaciously flew the flag for rock music at a time when the country preferred to listen to dance bands and ballad singers.
Although a commercially viable rock scene did not really happen in Ireland until the 1980s, the urban areas of the country in the Sixties were hotbeds of exciting young beat groups who eked out short careers in blues cellars and tennis clubs, some of them, like The Strangers, The Creatures, Orange Machine, Bluesville, Ditch Cassidy and the King Bees, The Greenbeats and Sugar Shack made some fine singles, others, like Granny's Intentions, Dr Strangely Strange, Eire Apparent and Andwella's Dream, advanced to album deals, the Sixties' medium of choice, and still more, like Them, Skid Row and Thin Lizzy, were crucibles for major Irish talents like Van Morrison, Gary Moore, Philip Lynott, Terry Woods, Horslips, Henry McCullough and Rory Gallagher, whose work would come to maturity in the 70s, 80s and beyond.
Though much of this early Irish rock music has become prized among record collectors, very little of it is ever heard. But The Radiators, finding some kinship of spirit with garage bands who did not go all the way commercially, have spent years exploring this area and have come up with some surprising and, they think, illuminating connections between those early records and what we now take to be ""Irish Rock"". And it is in this spirit, with genuine affection and respect, that they embarked upon this album of cover versions of some long-forgotten classics.

Why a Vinyl Release?
Primarily because there just has to be a vinyl release given the subject matter of Sound City Beat.
A vinyl version of SOUND CITY BEAT will give you the very best audio listening experience (as well as the full artwork and sleeve notes) that you just can't get with the digital and CD version. 
Sure vinyl crackles but to quote John Peel ""Somebody was trying to tell me that CD's are better than vinyl because they don't have any surface noise. I said, 'Listen, mate, life has surface noise.""
When I (Shite'n'Onions) released Trouble Pilgrim in the US in 2011, I had no intention of putting it out on vinyl initially, Philip Chevron made a suggestion that a vinyl version would be nice and I took the hint. When the finished LP's arrived from the pressing plant it was like holding a thing of beauty and playing the record was like hearing Trouble Pilgrim for the first time - the richness of the sound was just incredible.Vinyl is for those who value music not those who regard it as a disposable commodity."
286,1990885309,"Hey Kickstarter community, I'm Alex. An outdoor and travel photographer from California.
For this campaign, I'm more than excited to introduce to you my photobook - For Travelers.
Thanks for stopping by and showing some support!
New Zealand
Background
The desire to self-publish a photobook originally came to mind as a gift idea for my mom's birthday. Being an avid traveler herself, she cheered me on and supported me throughout my time abroad and I wanted to have a tangible way to share the memories I'd collected. Both to inspire us to make one together one day and to have a more permanent medium in which to view my photos in the future.
After putting a small book together to gift to her, I had a number of family members and friends reach out after she shared a few of my photos with them to see if I could send them a copy as well. Long story short, after sending out a few more, I felt inspired to create an even higher quality book to share with a larger audience. Which brings us here!
The Book
Over the past few months, I've sorted through thousands of photos and come up with 30 of my favorite memories to put together into a 10x8"" dark blue softcover coffee table book. Intended to be minimal and timeless, the book will feature images from my experiences traveling through the provinces of Vietnam, on the beaches in Bali, trekking in the mountains of New Zealand, and around the central coast of California. Alongside each photo will be a short story written by myself, detailing the experience behind the picture and where it was taken.
For Travelers is intended to be an inspirational letter of sorts to all those who have traveled and to those who wish to one day. Hopefully, it will delight and excite whoever picks it up!
Here's an example of the book's layout, as well as a couple of photos that'll be in the book:

Details
This Kickstarter project is aimed at raising funds to cover the best quality printing costs as well as packaging and proofing.
For the campaign to reach its final goal, it will need a total of 25 book-buying backers. All backers who order the book will receive it by mid-November and that's taking into account any potential slowdowns. So many people could receive it even sooner!
A breakdown of the Kickstarter goal:
Printing and packaging costs of 25 books.
  Up to 10% fee of total funding collected by Kickstarter.
  Final proofing costs with the printing company to ensure top quality.
  Like all Kickstarter campaigns, the project can only proceed with your support to reach the goal within a limited time frame. So please share the link as much as you can! Every bit helps!

You can only contribute to this project if you’re a Manhattan or Brooklynite!*
As an alternative to the tote, fanny pack, jean pocket, and human hand, I use my Conceptual Waist Apron, or what others call an “apron,” to carry my stuff.
Of the few I’ve painted for myself, I’ve appropriated the prints for two: the roses and airplanes print was conceived of by urban wear designer Jeremy Scott, and the lollipop is a representation of Wayne Thiebaud’s colored pencil drawing, Sucker. As the son of two lawyers, I’ve been raised as a copyright infringement-fearing person, and therefore will not sell these.
This project is to distribute two other models of painted aprons: one depicting Lipstick & Pokéballs, and the other, Screwdrivers & Jellyfish. 
Blueprint of Screwdrivers & Jellyfish
By its site-specific design, this apron is a conceptual art object. The wearer activates its characters’ bodies as sexual organs, but the binary is not as clear as M/F: it’s a game of inversions and mirror-ish power dynamics. Both species are stable individually, yet excited and conscious when put into play with each other. 
To protect the art object’s commodity value, I will produce them as limited editions: two of each kind, four total (and I’ll label my initials with the edition number, “1/2” and “2/2,” on the back corner of each apron). However, unlike most fine art limited editions, these aprons will be washing machine friendly and pre-washed.
I paint these pretty meticulously, so they take me a while to make – moving at a steady rate, I’ll finish one apron about every two weeks. I’m aiming to have all four done in two and a half months (eight weeks plus a two week margin of error). 
I've recently moved to NY and don't have any of the materials to do this. The cost of aprons, paint, brushes, and other necessary tools will be absorbed by your pledges, and the remainder will be spent on future art supplies.
*NOTE: I’m localizing this project’s distribution, so only if you’re in Manhattan or Brooklyn can you receive one hand delivered by me."

This project is about a book with 400 photos. These images document Josef Albers in his preliminary courses at the Ulm School of Design (Hochschule für Gestaltung, HfG Ulm), 1953-55.

What kind of images are those?
The photos were taken between 1953 and 1955 by Hans G. Conrad. He was HfG Ulm's first student. This is old school analogue photography, Leica, 35 mm, black and white. 
The main idea behind these images is truly modern: The documentation of the making of a new life with new forms, new ideas, new technologies for a new society (after the end of the second world war). It's not about the traditional ideology of uniqueness and the artist as a super hero – but it's about transparency of the process of democratic exchange. 
This HfG approach is the conceptual foundation of Conrad's works: He didn't arrange the one and only artistic »masterpiece« portrait in the old way. But he developed sequences of images that correspond with Albers' sequences of interactions. 
An example of the original cardboards which were used by the photographer, Hans G. Conrad, for archiving the negatives. The contact proofs show the sequences of images as if it were a stop motion film. This historic material inspired the graphic designer of the book, Petra Hollenbach, to use a similar banderole for the book cover.
What do we see on these images?
We see Albers teaching and in interpersonal exchange with people like Otl Aicher, Inge Aicher-Scholl, Hans Gugelot, and Max Bill. 
We see the students working at Albers' tasks: 
They are arranging paper acording to his exercises on the interaction of color. 
They are folding paper and create huge spatial structures out of it. 
They follow Albers' gestures and body language in free space, at the black board, and at the tables working with sand. 
We see Albers showing the fine differences of human posture. 
A sequence of images was taken when students produced a film about and with Albers teaching. (Sadly, this film has never been finalized.)  
And finally we see Albers at the Ulm train station, surrounded by students together with Inge Aicher-Scholl and Max Bill, saying goodbye and leaving in summer of 1955.

The portfolio of 5 gelatine silver prints, 18x24 cm, consists of these images.
Why are these images so valuable? 
It is important to me that these 400 images are printed coherent and completely – not just a small selection. For a simple reason: When I show these images to experts from a variety of disciplines, all of them see different details that enrich their knowledge and help deepen their understanding of contexts and backgrounds.
We’re all experts in our small section, which we take a closer look at. These images contain a wealth of valuable information about the time, about the intentions of the people, about their actual actions, about motives and backgrounds. No single person can know all this. To preserve this knowledge, we need to merge the details. Then it will continue to provide valuable insights into things we do not even have in mind.
And why an expensive book? Digital publication might be nice, too.
Paper is truly a valuable storage of our cultural memory. What is stored on paper will outlive the generations. That's why it's important to me that all the images are merged and preserved in a book. And furthermore: Printed publication is the reason why Hans G. Conrad has shot them.
Finally, Kickstarter is a chance for smart production: If this book would be published in a traditional publishing house, 148 Euro per copy were needed.
Who was Hans G. Conrad? 
Hans G. Conrad with his Leica III, ca. 1955
His friends called him Cony. He was born in Switzerland, on 11 June, 1926. He was a perfectionist in terms of visual culture. 
After World War II he got into contact with Max Bill, the Bauhaus-trained artist, architect and designer in Zurich. Bill asked Cony to join him and the Ulm team for developing the Hochschule für Gestaltung. Cony became HfG's first student. 
After his studies he worked at Braun (together with Fritz Eichler, google him). In 1962 he became head of international advertising at Lufthansa, and he assigned Otl Aicher to develop the corporate design which has reached legendary status. Cony was member of the board of design of the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich.  From 1970 to 1989 he was co-editor in chief of German magazine Capital – this was a unique position because he was responsible of the visual expression and the second editor in chief was responsible of the verbal expression. 
Cony died on 26 December, 2003, in Cologne.
Why me?
Cony gave his works to me in the late 1990s. I got into contact with him when I wrote my dissertation thesis on the political history of the Ulm School of Design, 1953-68. He said to me that he trusted in me, and that I would do the right thing with his works (16,000 images, 1,200 paper works). Well, do the right thing, that was a burden. 
Three years ago, I made the decision that I want to publish most of his images in books structured according to his groups of work. One group focuses on Josef Albers, for example. Another one focuses on Max Bill; on Otl Aicher; on Tomás Maldonado; on Hans Gugelot; on Friedrich Vordemberge-Gildewart; on Konrad Wachsmann; on HfG guests like Walter Gropius, Mies van der Rohe, Norbert Wiener, or Charles and Ray Eames; etc. – I want to start this series of printed publication with this first book on Josef Albers. 
I studied history, German language, and communication studies in Munich and Cologne. In the late 1980s I worked together with Otl Aicher for the Italian company durst. I published several books and essays on design and related topics. Since 2015 I'm earning a living as Professor of Design Theory in Cologne, Germany. The main focus of my research is the designers' societal responsibility and the future of design education. And yes, I must admit it: I‘m a little bit mad about the history of the Ulm School of Design.

 Biography
I started drawing faces on money in Oct 1995 in 5/1997 I started painting clown dollars in 1999 the first clown dollar were published into art prints.
In 2002 Jury had a daughter. Late in the year he realized he was never home due to the success of his Clown Dollr Art Prints. So Jury decided to put his brush down and become a stay at home dad to raise his daughter till she started school.
In 2006 Jury resumed his Artwork, but in late 2009 suffered a very bad mental break down and could barly function let alone paint. This lasted 5 years.
Finally in 2014 Jury once again picked up the brush with a fire like never before. And started out turning the best work of his career.
Earlier last year Jury has a Hugely successful kickstarter project with the Clown Dollar Art Prints.
In Oct 2014 Jury had 2 Painting's Published in The Art Of Living Dead Dolls - Art Book
NOW here is some of Jury's Defaced Money spanning 18 Years in Prints, Clown Dollar Art Prints
As written about Jury The Clown by Charles Scott Gallery
Jury The Clown
We wanted to write up something special for Jury the Clown. Not the usual slick marketing/sell copy you’d see elsewhere. Because he’s a different kind of artist. Every communication we (or anyone) receives from Jury ends with: All Love Jury The Clown ""LIFE Over Money"" A conversation with Jury is like a wonderful ride on a living amusement park ride. His views are different, exuberant and full of strong ideas. Here’s just one example: he refuses call people who enjoy his art “fans” – he calls them “supporters,“ because he, “never wants anyone to feel that he is ‘above’ them.” Another quote from Jury: “I want to use my voice and part of the money I make from art to help them.” He’s talking about the homeless. He has an almost manic passion about helping the homeless and to show that, “there are good people that care about others even if they don't know them.”
Gold Silly Dollars - JURY THE CLOWN COMMISSIONED ARTWORK Click on the link before for more information! Jury the clown 22k Gold - AND able to be turned in for a COMMISSIONED piece of art. In terms of his art: we like to say that he “defaces” money. It’s a bit of a violent word, but his paintings, or “Clown Dollars” literally remove the face from money. To take away it’s power and it’s evil and to remind us that life is about fun and living and art. Not money and greed and materialism. And these incredible hand-painted bills represent a little of that Jury love…that you can bring home to you. Jury’s art first hit the streets around 1997 and by 1999 his art was appearing in publications around the world. While his hand-painted, defaced bills can be purchased exclusively through the Charles Scott Gallery. EACH BILL comes signed by Jury, is Matted and includes a Charles Scott Gallery COA. NOTE: a ""c"" after the price denotes a circulated bill, which means it may have wrinkles or slight stains, etc. These circulated bills have been discounted because of this. Also, neither Jury nor the Charles Scott Gallery implies any ownership of copyrighted images or characters - the images below are purely artful representations."

Hola, somos Zanate, un festival de cine dedicado única y exclusivamente al documental mexicano, y tenemos nuestro nido en la bella ciudad de Colima, México.
Creemos en un diseño que sea de gran calidad en su programación y organización, pero regido por la sencillez y la inclusión. Un festival pensado para los realizadores y para el público por igual, que permita la convivencia de todos los involucrados en un ambiente cálido y cercano, como una gran familia.
Apostamos por un formato íntimo y de puertas abiertas, donde cada proyección constituya una experiencia única e irrepetible para los realizadores y el público. Una programación pequeña, pero minuciosamente cuidada. Un formato que permita vivir la experiencia del festival por completo, en el que cada actividad pueda coexistir y complementarse con el resto del programa.
Durante estos 10 años de vida hemos logrado un festival sui generis, tanto por su diseño como por su identidad, ya que somos el único festival exclusivamente de cine documental mexicano en el país. Ese es nuestro sello identitario y nuestro granito de arena.
Trabajamos arduamente en la formación de público y fomentamos la producción local de documentales. Contamos con un programa de formación continua y un proyecto de exhibición que va mucho más allá del festival mismo. Sumamos voluntades y creamos lazos con otros colectivos, festivales, individuos; para la difusión, formación y exhibición del documental.
Clausura de 10ª edición Zanate
Este 2018 estaremos celebrando nuestra undécima edición.
Ha sido un maravilloso viaje, logrado desde la (imprescindible) independencia y en una ciudad pequeña (y encantadora) como Colima, apostando por la descentralización y la creación de nuevos espacios.
Y esto se ha logrado gracias a la voluntad de muchas personas e instituciones (públicas y privadas) que creen y apuestan junto a nosotros por el documental mexicano.
Es por eso hoy que tocamos tu puerta, porque buscamos más aliados para poder continuar el camino.
Celebrando 10 años apostando por el documental.
¿QUÉ BUSCAMOS HACER?
Con tu aportación nos ayudas a solventar muchos de los gastos de producción, indispensables para la realización del festival. Cada persona que se involucra en el proyecto nos permite hacer más y más cosas.
Creemos en los fondos mixtos, en que los proyectos se pueden realizar con la suma de muchas voluntades. Eso es lo que nos da la independencia, y esa independencia nos da libertad. Por eso apostamos para que nuestro público, amigos, aliados y cualquier persona que se quiera sumar sean parte de la producción de este proyecto.
Estamos por dar los primeros pasos hacia una nueva década y es algo que queremos celebrar junto a ustedes.
ESTO ES UNA FIESTA, ASÍ QUE LLENÉMONOS DE REGALOS.
Creemos en el cine como un proyecto colaborativo y somos muy agradecidos. Por eso tenemos una serie de recompensas para todas las personas que decidan sumarse a esta iniciativa. Recompensas hechas con amor y a la medida. Un distintivo especial para Zanates honorarios.
Elaboraremos piezas únicas e irrepetibles, con un tiraje mínimo, diseñadas por nuestros amigos de Simbiosis Estudio de Diseño, Bienmesabes Clothing y la ilustradora Abril Márquez.
Las recompensas serán entregadas durante los días del festival en nuestras distintas sedes. Para quienes no puedan estar, podemos entregarlas en el área metropolitana de las ciudades de Colima y Guadalajara, sin costo, o en su defecto, se las enviamos por paquetería con todo el gusto del mundo (más gastos de envío, claro está).
Ayúdanos a seguir conquistando espacios para compartir historias.
¡Apuesta por el documental!"
292,1120229089,"Bounce aspiration is to make it easy and affordable for people to seize life opportunities in line with their aspirations, anywhere in the world, zeroing accommodation costs for long-term stay, ranging from few weeks to some months.
Bounce is based on a community of people that instead of using their homes as their exclusive possession, they transform them into a key to access thousands of other properties of like-minded people.
Bounce is about the efficient use of already existing resources to jump on projects and opportunities, attend events, and live differently, regardless of where this is going to happen. Because today, as the world gets smaller and smaller, your life may happen somewhere else.
Unlike other platforms, this is neither about renting a place nor about the accommodation itself It’s more about solving the problem of the accommodation to let you focus on what you need to do in this specific moment of your life. And it’s not about holidays: other platforms ask you “where would you like to go?”.
Bounce asks you “where do you need to be?”.
HOW IT WORKS
It’s very easy.
You must own a property that you are willing to share with other users while you are not there. Then you feel compelled to pursue an opportunity which implies to move to another city or country. You list your place and then enter the destination of your choice and the period, ranging from 3 weeks to 26 weeks. Bounce will match all the information entered by users like you to create as many viable combinations as possible, according to the requirements, which include place, period, number of bouncing people, special needs and flexibility on dates and destinations.
The other option is a direct search: in this case you find a person, in the Bounce community, who might have a suitable property that is already available or could be, and you contact her. Is the period matching? Are you happy with each other?
Then you just subscribe and leave to enjoy your life there.
You can enjoy someone else's place as long as you made your property available to others: in Bounce, for every transaction, we use time as the currency, not money, apart from subscription (see Costs).  
A rating system, the possibility to communicate with other users, feedbacks and technical support will help you to make it run smoothly.  
The Bounce platform can be joined on invitation. This means that as a user, you contribute to the network trust and growth directly by inviting people you esteem, with homes in different and attractive locations. Inviting people is part of a reward mechanism offering benefits.
The Bounce philosophy is based on the idea that its users own their own words and actions: it’s a direct call to assume responsibility. Bounce has one major rule: leave every place as you found it, possibly a little bit better off. It’s an invitation to care about others, about future others, like we should do for our future generations. It’s an invitation to make things better.
WHY BOUNCE? 
It may sound strange to you but it all started with a single question: why as a collective we produce results that individually we don't want, like environmental issues, economic crisis, cultural clashes and spiritual disconnection?
One of the answers we came with was that too many people are not living their lives according to their expectations, and so they do not bring their best contribution to life. Many people are trapped into repetitive loops, under inspired by their employers and disengaged by their jobs, disappointed by corporations’ goals and targets they do not understand or share anymore.
Many others postponed their dreams for too long, while some other simply gave up. They made reasonable compromises.
We also believe that sometimes the outcomes we generate do not reflect our innate ability to perform but the complexion of the situation in which the performance occurs. 
So we came with the idea that as the world gets smaller and smaller, stretched by constant disruption and fuelled by unprecedented opportunities, we can help you to do something more fulfilling and rewarding, something with a larger impact on your life and the lives of those close to you. According to us there’s plenty of reasons to bounce. 
And that’s why we define Bounce a B2Be.
WHY KICKSTARTER?
We have four priorities guiding our decision to crowdfund Bounce. In order of importance they are:
Make it happen: we deeply believe in the positive social impact of Bounce and this is motivating us to transform a concept into a project, no matter what.
Build a community: there’s no value co-creation and delivery without a critical mass of users that offers (share?) a reasonable number of locations. Bounce is for people, not for us.
Be independent: we dream about creating Bounce together with its users, before turning to business angels. We want to promote a culture of trust and respect, not of exponential growth.
Think long-term: we think of additional services and smoother operations, and those mentioned so far represent the first steps of many we have in mind.
We believe that Kickstarter is the right place to achieve them.
IS BOUNCE FOR YOU? 
Do you sense a call to action, to adventure? Is it an invitation to a true calling, something you feel you can’t not do? Is life asking you to cross your personal threshold and return with a gift? Then, you may find yourself in the list below and start gathering the courage to follow your aspirations.
The Digital Nomad: you can work from almost any location in the world, you just need a computer, a wi-fi connection and some good coffee. You like to change your spot to get inspired by fresh people, new places and good food. You sit, watch and work your magic. From one place, and another and another.
The Career Seeker: you are looking into the opportunity to step up your career, and you need to move to another city or country. You want to live there for a while before selling your house, buying a new one or rent a place for the long term. You want to get familiar with the new job, with the new colleagues as well as with the place and the culture.
The Temporary Guy: you have the opportunity to work for your company in a different location. You feel like it would be important to seize the opportunity but company benefits do not cover all additional expenses. And yet you don’t want to give up.
The Student: your background is no longer sufficient to win challenges in a constantly evolving job market. You would like to acquire fresh competences but you feel like education costs are already too high, not to mention the accommodation costs.
The Doctoral: you have taken this as far as you could, getting a master in your area of research, and the only step missing is moving to the lab where they have tools, knowledge and funds for your final work. You just need to find an affordable accommodation. Everything else is set.
The Seasonal: you can take advantage of your skills and expertise somewhere else, for a limited period. But the risk is that all the economical advantages are zeroed by temporary relocation costs. Finding an accommodation at no costs will make it only as expensive as buying flight tickets or drive there.
The Breaker: you decided that time has come to take a year off and you want to make sure you live it at the fullest. You want to use the money you saved for experiences, not to rent a room or a house.
The Artist: life for you is about beauty. You are creative and you like to spend time with people that breathe and celebrate art and beauty. Exhibitions, festivals, parades and events: wherever visionaries play the notes and colors of tomorrow, you have to be there. With them. 
The Patient: you need to get a medical treatment for your condition. Doctors are positive about the therapy which is already quite expensive. Solving the accommodation cost would relieve your already troubled mind.
The Family Guy: you want time for you and your family. You need to run away from a life where you do not even have time to enjoy each other with your wife and your kids. You want to discover how it would be to live and grow your children somewhere else.
 The Globetrotter: you believe that life at its fullest is experiencing other cultures and places. You love meeting new people, the more different from you, the better. You like collecting experiences instead of Hard Rock Café T-shirts.
The Language Lover: you get crazy about languages. You are never satisfied with learning few words just to be able to have a crappy chat. And you know that the best way to learn and keep a language alive is using it. Daily.
 The Homesitter: no, that’s not you! That’s what you are looking for when you are leaving for a period, either for holiday or on a business trip where your boss covers all accommodation costs. But you love the idea of someone taking take care of your place, the same as you would do. Maybe of your car too. And why not of your pets and plants. Your home needs someone to watch over her.
The Displaced: you have more than one property and you believe in the value of true sharing. You like the idea that someone might do something good and beautiful with your help making your day more than a handful of bucks. And at the same time you earn time to spend somewhere else once you are ready to go.

COSTS
Bounce uses time, not money, as the currency
You make your place available for 3 weeks? Then, you earn 3 weeks to stay at someone else’s home. Anywhere, as long as there’s a Bounce user available. The only cost is the annual subscription of 99 Euro.
WHERE WILL BOUNCE BE AVAILABLE?
Bounce will kick off in Europe, USA, Canada, Japan, Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong.
Other locations will follow depending on requests and invitations.

Through the Ministry of Environment my family has received many sacred to our Aboriginal Peoples animals that have died in various ways and are honored by creating what is known as ""Regalia"".
The creation of this regalia will take approximately 10 months, harvesting the medicines and then creating the body of work. This project will preserve a very important aspect of indigenous lifestyle.
Once the project is completed it shall go on public exhibition in Vancouver to share with the Canadian people.
Mark MiLan is committed to this project and it shall bring honour to his family and as well to the Aboriginal community.
With many new Canadians arriving and integration to Canada it is important that our culture be showcased/preserved to educate about our unique history."

EL PROYECTO - The Project
Mi nombre es Antonio Peralta Naranjos, Director, guionista y editor de el filme FRUTO, he participado previamente en el festival Smart Films y Rally en corto y últimamente en el cortometraje ""Delirios de Un Gato Callejero"".
My name is Antonio Peralta Naranjos, Director, screenwriter and editor of the film FRUTO, I have previously participated in the Smart Films and Rally festival in short and lately in the short film ""Delirios de Un Gato Callejero"".
FRUTO es un drama surrealista de horror que se centra en la mente de su protagonista, de como lo que podemos interpretar como amor nos puede destruir.
Todas las emociones de Laura se retrataran de manera onírica implícita para demostrar el odio, deseo y culpa.
La idea de este largometraje es el de perturbar y conocer los lados más oscuros de la mente humana de una forma diferente y que a pesar de sus escenas surrealistas todo sea muy real.
FRUTO is a surreal horror drama that focuses on the mind of its protagonist, on how what we can interpret as love can destroy us.
All of Laura's emotions will be portrayed in an implicit dreamlike way to demonstrate hatred, desire and guilt.
The idea of this feature film is to disturb and know the darkest sides of the human mind in a different way and that despite its surreal scenes everything is very real.
REFERENCIAS VISUALES - Visual References
Para la cinematografía del film, utilizamos de referencia distintas películas y pinturas para darle un tono surrealista y bizarro.
For the cinematography of the film, we use different films and paintings as reference to give it a surreal and bizarre tone.
CAST
El cast esta conformado por actores y actrices no profesionales, esto se hizo con la idea de que los personajes tengan una personalidad más realista, similar a quienes les interpretan.

Lo que necesitamos y para que lo necesitamos - What we need and why we need it
necesitamos los fondos para realizar la filmación de la película y la postproducción (utilizando equipo profesional), ya que prácticamente no contamos con nada para la realización, también necesitaremos recursos para el transporte y alimento de los actores junto con algunos efectos especiales.
We need the funds to do the filming of the film and the post-production (using professional equipment), since we have practically nothing for the making, we will also need resources for the transportation and food of the actors along with some special effects.
EL IMPACTO - The impact
El proyecto tiene como meta demostrar que se puede hacer buen cine con lo minimo, ya que mucha justifica la baja calidad de la cintas de hoy en día en México por que supuestamente utilizan poco dinero, cosa que es totalmente absurda, ya que grandes cineastas lograron hacer muy buenas películas con mucho menos dinero que ellos.
The project aims to demonstrate that good cinema can be made with the minimum, since much justifies the low quality of the films of today in Mexico because they supposedly use little money, which is totally absurd, since great filmmakers managed make very good movies with much less money than them.

295,1080231048,"Hi, my name is Jon Beagle. My fiance, Tiffany, and I are about to embark on a spiritual journey around the world. Starting in Colombia and continuing on to where ever the wind takes us, we will be backpacking, staying in tents and couchsurfing as means of sleeping.
But that's not why you're here. You see, I've loved music ever since I was about 5 when I got my first guitar. From there on I would bang on anything that made a sound, always finding a new instrument to learn. I want to broadcast this type of creativity to the world through a Youtube channel featuring people that have no way of being heard outside of their towns. Whether it's a simple street violinist playing in the subways of Brazil., or a beautiful pianist that grew up outside of the technology age and would have no clue where to begin to be heard on the web.
My project is called World Sessions, a place to hear the unheard. I think music produces an amazing energy, but as an energy it can make one feel good or bad. I feel as though the world is more exposed to the bad. I want to lighten the vibe and bring a new type of music to humanity, music with a message, with soul. 
Posted is a video as an example of the project idea.
I need funding for plane tickets, filming and sound equipment. We thank you all for any contribution and really hope others can see my vision of exposing a new beauty to the music scene that tends to be overlooked or hidden behind the garbage we hear today.
Also, if all goes well I plan on turning it in to a whole website, where you could download music at a price you choose fitting even if that price is free. Also, I would like to get artists to do paintings and drawings that would be sold the same way as a donation, instead of at a set price.
Thank you once again for your time. I really hope we can make this happen.
This is just the beginning of my project so I'm going to put up a couple of my friends songs as a start.

296,1595151990,"STRETCH GOAL: $18,000
We're happy to say we reached our goal on May 15th, which appropriately was Endangered Species Day! Now that we know we can make a good film, we'd love your support in helping us make it even better! With more funds, we'll be able to bring on more support in post-production, bring together panels at screenings to lead a more thoughtful discussion, and allow us to distribute the film more effectively. Every dollar will help us make a better film, and every backer will help us engage more people in this important story.
North Carolina is the last home to one of the most endangered mammals on the planet: The red wolf. The state has also signed a resolution that formally asks the federal government to abandon the recovery project and declare the wolves extinct in the wild.
Red wolves are an elusive species native to the southern US, and used to roam from Pennsylvania to Florida, and as far west as Texas. Because of habitat loss and hunting, the species was driven down to near extinction. Through a series of ambitious precautions, the wolves were successfully re-introduced to North Carolina, where they are found to this day. Now, roughly 100 individuals live in the wild. This program became the initial groundwork for the grey wolf re-introduction in Yellowstone National Park and a blueprint for the California condor program.
The reasons outlined in the resolution are complicated. There are questions of land use, culture, and science that muddle together into a variety of difficult problems. While the US Fish and Wildlife Service considers the future of the program, people in North Carolina are voicing their opinions. After speaking with several residents, scientists, and landowners, it is clear that the issue isn't as simple as being ""pro-wolf"" or ""anti-wolf,"" as it is often portrayed.
This short film will investigate the reasons for North Carolina wanting this species extinct in the wild, and help the variety of perspectives see eye-to-eye. We hope the film can help the conversation reach a point that considers the importance of wild species, while recognizing and addressing concerns from people being directly affected by these decisions.
Though the wolves may remain in zoos and nature centers across the country, this decision could effectively terminate the red wolf's chance for survival in the wild. Further, it would set a precedent for endangered species across the country that would allow for irreversible changes to our biodiversity as we see fit. For that reason, we think this issue needs our attention as storytellers.
To keep up with our progress and photos from the field, consider following our Facebook page: facebook.com/RedWolfRevival
We all have backgrounds connecting us to storytelling and environment. It turns out that we all enjoy working together too! Below is a list of the producers and a little bit about each us. There are more people involved than we have listed; Jeremy Collins is helping us create artwork, The Lone Bellow is adding their musical talents, and many others will help each element of the film come together in a truly unique piece.
We're really excited about these rewards. We hope they make you proud to support not only this project, but to support the conversation. The wonderfully creative Jeremy Collins created some original work for us, highlighting the landscape and the wolf (which you can attain if you're able to donate $200 to our project!).
For a summary of the rewards, here's a little guide to help you decipher what is unique to each tier. 
We're half-way through production, and now we need your help to complete production, finish the film, and start sharing the final piece. If we reach our goal, we will announce our stretch goals that will include more crew and even stronger distribution. We've pared down our budget to be as simple as possible, while still allowing us to make a film that will do this story justice. With more funding, we can be even more efficient and capitalize on each person's skillset.

The concept of challenge night really excites us here at gamesyne…challenges will be sent out on a specific night and will appear on the main title screen of the game as a separate icon. Challenges will be sent out via Facebook, twitter and in game via push notification. Players can decide to participate in that nights challenge, such as Toppling a high score or achieving a certain kill streak without getting hit, this will be tracked on special leader boards set up for the challenge. We are really hoping that we can build a community around these challenge night and make them a weekly highlight!
Opt out...
before you all start waving your hands in the air and flipping desks about Facebook log-on and push notifications...Tapshot also has a non-social connected log in to save your progress if you want, and of course all of the above features are opt out.
Progress on Tapshot has steadily increased over the span of the project, we currently have one level complete with another in early production. Our main constraint is purely time to work on the project and get it done.
Most of the core systems are in and working, including the social features and challenges. Kickstarter will help us fund the time to build out the levels and perfect the gameplay, so we can release the best possible game we can.
The game is built entirely in Flash and Adobe Air and is currently targeting Android and iOS, with the view to explore blackberry once we have launched.
Formed in August 2011, Game Synesthesia is an independent video game developer with a goal to create new and original experiences in video games. 
Production on Tapshot started in late 2011 as simple proof of concept, since then production has progressed to the point of getting the game relesed and finally finished! 
And here lays the biggest hurdle, TIME. I have been working on Tapshot for what seems like an ETERNITY, Being only able to work on the game in my 'spare' time due to stupid life commitments like a full time jobs and the such...
This is where Kickstarter and the wonderful community that is you come in, to help us get Tapshot finally DONE and out the door, and also pick up some sweet rewards!
What will the money be used for?
The money raised from the kickstarter will go towards:
Funding my time to work on the game
Buying essential licences and assets
Funding artwork by our part time artist Aaron
Providing rewards to backers
Extra money will be put back into the project to make the game even better, and to offer bigger rewards to backers and stretch goals!

298,1810478887,"Providence is Alan Moore’s quintessential horror series! In it, he weaves and reinvents the works of H.P. Lovecraft through historical events. It is both a sequel and prequel to Neonomicon, and the resulting masterpiece owes a great deal to his artistic partner, Jacen Burrows. Dreadful Beauty: The Art of Providence is a celebration of the amazing work of Burrows. Over 15 years of his works are featured here, all showcasing Burrows' original pencils and inks. Included is a complete cover gallery -- from The Courtyard to Neonomicon to Providence -- as well as choice pages, designs, and lots of unused and never-before-made-public art! For fans of the series, this is a wonderful companion volume showcasing the haunting artwork and painstaking labor that went into bringing it to life. We offer a special hardcover edition for your support that you won't want to miss. But don't just take our word for it -
 ""Jacen Burrows, somehow combining immaculate Swiss-watch precision and wrenching human emotion, is a contemporary master of comic-book art with an instantly classical style that looks like it’s surely been around forever; a timeless line that is as distinctive and original as anything the medium has ever produced. And while I am admittedly biased, I believe his astonishing work on Providence to represent a new level of accomplishment in the career of this already stellar artist and craftsman. A unique and genuinely remarkable talent."" - Alan Moore 
And what better way to showcase this incredible series than with the Providence Complete Slipcase: A beautiful set of all the related works in hardcover editions in an exclusive slipcase with new art by Burrows. The Slipcase Set includes five volumes: Neonomicon, Providence Act 1, Providence Act 2, Providence Act 3, and Dreadful Beauty: The Art of Providence.

299,983631585,"Bryony is a comedian and actor and is taking her debut Show, 'Flamingo' to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival for the first time. She was a little unlucky last year and didn't manage to get the right venue for her show and now three years since her first Camden Fringe preview she has bagged herself a space at Underbelly and a fab time slot. 
In the show 'Flamingo"" I have six different characters and they are all intertwined in their own little world, I suppose thats what will set it apart from other character comedy shows on the circuit in that most of the characters are linked so you feel like your following the journey of each of them and they feel finished rather than seeing one and then never coming back to them. I felt this was important in the creative process, I don't want the audience to feel hard done by and that they haven't heard all their stories.
Bryony has been super busy in the last two years selling out previews at Pleasance, Brighton Fringe Festival, Sydenham Arts Festival and recently selling out her Vaults Festival debut. She's even had some nice reviews along the way! -
'Bryony twydle has a comedy show with some great material, sharp comic timing, fleshed out characterisation and thoughtful design...comic gold.' ★★★★★- view from the gods
Impressively dynamic and effortlessly charismatic, she will surely only go from strength to strength' - londontheatre1 ★★★★ 
'She is definitely one to watch for the future' reviewshub ★★★★ 
'Twydle pulls it off with aplomb!'- funny women ‘
She has so far managed to raise £5000 to pay for her venue and PR and photos for the show through bits of acting work she has had over the last year. She still however as a way to go! 
WHY EDINBURGH THOUGH YOU ASK?!
It will be potentially a fantastic opportunity to build new audiences and be seen by press, casting directors and people in the industry and its also one of the largest arts festivals and a place where I can finally debut my full length show! For me its an amazing opportunity and a hugely important step for me in my career as a comedian and actor.
The money raised is going to go towards -
Flyers
Technician's fee 
Marketing costs
Travel expenses 
Accomadation
The kickstarter fee 10% contingency fund 
If I don't reach my target of £1000 I don't get any of the money so its sooooo important that I reach my target and even better if I manage to make more as there's still things i'm sure I haven't accounted for! Also this isn't something that I could afford to do every year so for me although it could be seen as a risk financially I see it as an investment in my career and something I should throw myself whole heartedly into!"

A wildly creative and motivated team of University of Florida students and alumni filmmakers are embarking on another adventure this summer. This group is set to film in June of 2019 a  fantastically wicked horror film. 
This Kickstarter is being put towards our budget for the film. It will be used on any equipment, props, outfits, production design, food for crew and location creation for the film. The support through this page will help create opportunities for all the members in our cast and crew to gain valuable experience that will benefit them in their future careers. We are all dedicated to making this film the best it can be.
It would be greatly appreciated by the crew for any help and support that is given. After production, we plan to submit this into festivals because we believe that it has the potential to shake up the horror genre. Below is a summary of ""Growing Pains"". We hope you take the time to peak inside our little creation.
Summary:
      DARREL has just graduated High School with his two best friends, TREVOR and JENNIE. He is under the impression that all 3 of them will stay together in the small town during college, Trevor and Jennie have different plans. They plan to move away to start their own separate adventures.
      In the hope to change Darrel’s mind and motivate him to move on, Jennie and Trevor have dug up the time capsule the 3 buried together as children. One last trip down memory lane turns into a night of nightmares, when the 3 friends don’t only open a box of memories but open the gate for a fiendish and horrific figure, called The Gazer.
     As Jennie and Trevor work to rid themselves of The Gazer’s torture, Darrel is determined to show the true potential The Gazer has as the savior of their friendship."

The Self Care Adventure Cards are something I needed to create. Most solutions that have taken over, seemingly every feed I scroll through, involve strict systems and frameworks to follow that I simply didn't have time for. 
Self care should be intuitive, ﬁt into my lifestyle, and only when I need to focus on myself. I wanted to make it as easy as possible to tap into self care - whenever and wherever - and that's why I created this deck.   
Click here to back today! 
My friends and I agree that life can get monotonous. The same activities that brought us joy, pleasure, and relaxation, have slowly become uninteresting and tedious. As we matured, we realized what we were doing to ""take care"" of ourselves, were just distractions to cope with the stress of our lives (hello, scrolling Netflix anybody?!) We needed actual satisfaction to maintain our wellbeing.
By designing this deck, deﬁned by its natural aesthetic, I was able to offer an open-ended solution to create a stress-free environment for my self-care adventure, anytime and anywhere I needed to replenish my quality of life.
Each activity is designed to spark inspiration in the moment, and driven to action entirely by my needs. With 150+ prompts, we can draw a card, see if it sparks, and either carry it through or draw another. 
In creating the deck, I found certain themes in my various activities emerge. ""Self care"" as a whole can feel huge, and I aimed to break down self care into 5 different categories. With these categories, you can better your routine by choosing what theme works for you in the moment. 
 Draw one, and bring some zest back into your life through movement and by clearing stale energy. 
When you pull a card to nourish yourself, you can ﬁll your cup back up by taking the time to love yourself.

 Taking a card to focus on using your words, body, and mind to bring something of your own into this word.
 A reminder to connect the dots between yourself and those around you, is where a card may inspire the next fulﬁlling conversation.
 To prompt yourself into digging deeper, either actively or passively, use these to reﬂect on your journey through life.
At the end of the day, making decisions is taxing. The Self Care Adventure Cards take that out of that equation by giving us a portable deck of inspiration to draw on and ﬁnally have the tool to progress your self care adventure.
No stress. No Strict Program. Just a better quality of life. 
With the Self Care Adventure Cards, I make room for myself to practice when I need it to keep on in the pursuit of what I care most about in life: creativity, friendships, and connecting with myself.
The Self Care Adventure Rewards are more than just cards. 


We've spent over 3 months building out your rewards. We've partnered with a great company that has the best quality card decks.  We have ensured support in the manufacturing. The card cloth is soft and 100% cotton. The wood block is locally manufactured by a carpenter and made from oak. 
In an attempt to ensure the best shipping rates for our backers we are waiting until after the campaign to finalize shipping costs.  Here are the estimates:  
There are many ways to use the deck, but it's entirely up to you. 
Here are a few ways to get your imagination started: 
1. Shuffle the deck and choose at random.

2. Sift through the cards and choose what pops out.

3. Separate the deck into piles by each category and go from there.  
Hi, I'm Jenni Kowal. 
I am a multipassionate visual artist with a taste for photography, design and huge pops of color. My business, Anytime Creative, helped me ﬁnally get the Self Care Adventure Cards off the ground and allow me to share this wonderful tool with you. Because I believe that anyone, anywhere, at anytime can be creative, my life's passion is to help other artists and creatives with their self care routines to live a more creative and fulﬁlling life. I draw my inspiration at the intersection where (wo)man meets nature by traveling the world or splitting my time between New Jersey and Nashville. My primary focus is self care and the belief that taking care of yourself ﬁrst will allow everything else in life to fall into place.

** We are working diligently to get these in your hands, however there is no guarantee these will be in by the holidays. We are trying to do what we can to expedite the first shipment, but with how the world is slowing down in light of the pandemic, we've been informed by the suppliers that it might not be feasible to deliver by the December date.

About the Project
This summer I am planning to travel across the United States like I have done the past few summers to capture different places across the United States. I will start in Southern California and travel to Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and possibly a few others. I want to offer images taken on this trip into a special book to be delivered in October 2014 called The Summer 2014 Book of Images. I also want to offer images I have taken in the past in the book The Journey So Far. 
I will be using Blurb to create and print the books The Journey So Far and The Summer 2014 Book of Images.

The places you never heard about. The places that are not on a map. That is what Photography Across the United States is about, seeing the beauty in the places not found on the map.
Photography Across the United States is being done by a photographer who grew up in a small town an hour or two away from the big city lights of Los Angeles and Hollywood in Rosamond, CA. Originally a one stop light town with miles between your home and a grocery store. While we have added a few stop lights and homes are closer together, Rosamond, CA still embodies small town USA.

Selva de Mar has been playing 'aquatic music' since 2006. Aside from touring around Europe, Japan and the Middle East, we have recorded 3 full-length albums and many of our songs have been used for movies and video art works.
Our self-titled debut was recorded in 3 hours in Barcelona. One year later we made “Olas Invisibles” which was recorded over 2 days in a cathedral in Catalonia. With the third album “Club Eden” we went in a live experimental direction: we recorded with live audio processing over the course of 4 days.
Now we are very pleased to announce that we're cooking our 4th album, once again recording in a church. But this time it will take longer, this album is a different story it is much more complex and deep; each time we are trying to dive deeper to explore new sounds and textures.
Our duo (hang, cello, percussion) has the pleasure to invite for this work artists such as :

Voices: Stephanie Pan, singer and performance artist living in Holland and originally from the United States; mû , singer, poet and multi instrumentalist from Guinea Bissau.
Bassoon: Eyal Street, whose register includes all kinds of bassoons and different wind instruments, early and modern.
Drummer: Oriol Roca, originally from Catalonia and capable of adapting to any kind of music styles.

and our super Producer from whatabout music: Dave Bianchi
Now we are nearly done with the recording process, and we're entering the process of post-production. There is a secret artist who is part of this process, he is taking selva de mar recordings into a new voyage, adding a new processed layer to our crystal sound.
There are many people working behind this “birth” and yet still a lot of work to be done. This is why we approach you to come and take part in this adventure. With Kickstarter you can start a new journey as a producer!

Selva de Mar joue de la “musique aquatique” depuis 2006. En plus de nos tournées en Europe, au Japon et au Moyen-Orient, nous avons enregistré trois albums et nombreuses de nos chansons ont été utilisées pour des films ou des œuvres d’art vidéo.
Notre album début a été enregistré durant 3 heures à Barcelone. Une année plus tard naît “Olas Invisibles” (vagues invisibles) enregistré pendant 2 jours dans une cathédrale catalane. Dans notre 3ème album “Club Eden”, nous nous sommes prêtés à une expérimentation en live, grâce à des effets audio ajoutés à l’enregistrement, sur une durée de 4 jours.
Aujourd’hui nous vous annonçons avec enthousiasme que nous cuisinons notre 4ème album, utilisant de nouveau une église comme studio d’enregistrement. Mais cette fois il s’agit d’une autre histoire, plus longue, et aussi plus complexe. Notre idée est de plonger chaque fois un peu plus profond dans l’exploration de nouveaux sons et nouvelles textures.

Maintenant que nous avons terminé la phase d’enregistrement, nous entrons dans celle de post-production. C’est à ce moment-ci qu’intervient l’artiste secret, qui emène les enregistrements de Selva de Mar vers un autre voyage, rajoutant une nouvelle touche à notre son cristallin.
Nous sommes plusieurs à travailler à cette “naissance”, et il nous reste encore beaucoup à faire. C’est pourquoi nous vous invitons à participer à l’aventure. Avec Kickstarter devenez vous aussi producteur !

About the KickStarter -
Land of Dragons is one of My earliest worlds I developed, having created the original concept at the age of 12. With summer giving me a break from my studies, I have decided to take this time to work on a couple of books I started with the plan to finish LoD by the end of the year. If successful, I will make it a goal to publish at least 1 book a year, with next year's book focusing on Native Americans. All earnings from the KickStarter will go directly to my college funds, as that is not cheap!
~~~
Why KickStarter? -
I am a college student looking to make up the last bit needed to pay for the next academic year. $1000 is what I expect will be the most needed that isn't covered by scholarships I have earned, and I would like to avoid taking out a loan again. I currently have a part time job, but if I can manage to meet my goal on this campaign, I will shift my focus from that to my writing, knowing my needs are met for college. I will still work on the book if the campaign doesn't meet the goal, the only difference will be what takes the focus of my time. If the campaign fails, I will just work on the book in my free time."
305,2096155258,"  Traveling to mysterious pyramids graced by adorned jaguar sculptures, watching the Son Jarocho musicians and dancers of Vera Cruz, witnessing the beauty of the Celestial Gardens, and stumbling upon inherent beauty in between, will provide the most precious of inspiration to paint.  The plan is to immerse myself into beautiful and culturally rich places such places as Oaxaca and Coatzacoalcos.   I'll be expanding and evolving as an artist, and creating paintings inspired by Mexico's beloved landscapes and culture. 
   First off, I'll fly into Mexico City where I'll explore ancient pyramids.  From there I'll begin making my way North to the most colorful city in the world Guanajuato.  After that I will be headed South to Vera Cruz, then to beautiful Coatzacoalcos, then to Oaxaca.  I will be painting while I travel as well as taking photos for referencing.  I will stay in each place for a week or so, to get a good feel of the revered attributes of the location, including any wildlife and nature. I also plan on being flexible about the destinations, as I may feel called to certain places in the moment.  The voyage is set to be a little over a month.
   Many people say that my art has a Mexican vibe to it, so it's going to be amazing to have Mexico make a direct impact and influence on my art and new paintings.  I will bring you colorful art full of inspiration, culture, and sacred love.  You will feel the travels through the art.  
  My art is inspired by my upbringing and experiences in life.  I was born in the Antelope Valley Desert in Southern, California just east of the Mojave.  I spent most of my childhood on a ranch in the desert.  I found the desert to be beautiful and mysterious.  The desert is calm and peaceful, but can also be a very harsh environment for life.  The desert is a place where one can easily find solitude.  The vibrant desert sunset is a magnificent source for meditation, and rebirth.  My goal is to create paintings that bring the onlooker peace, stillness, and a place to remember we are all eternal burning love.

I felt at home there because the small town and solitude of nature reminded me of childhood.  I learned a lot about living alternatively there.  There were many people that grew up there during the 60's and the influence was still alive and strong.   I enjoyed hearing their wild stories of the past and how it used to be.  The town had an overall hippie vibe.  I revisited psychedelic music that I was first exposed to as a child through my parents.  I had a different perspective this time around because I had a greater understanding of the message.  I attribute the freedom of this music as an inspiration to my style of painting.  Psychedelic music gives a sense of peace, wonderment, freedom, mystery, and burning love.  I describe some of my art as psychedelic desert scenes, when asked what style of art I paint.
   The art I paint is very heart chakra centered.  Often times, people say that the scene makes them feel the love.  It makes their hearts smile.  The sacred heart is a symbol of burning love.  It's that feeling of loving and being loved.  It's those times when you think, ""Wow I'm happy"".  It's that feeling you get when you're expressing your heart's passions.
   My Grandmother Tomasa Molinar, mother of thirteen, was a huge influence.  I lived with her and my mother throughout most of my childhood.  She was born in Mexico, but my mother was born in the States.  Sometimes it's difficult for people to pass down cultural knowledge from generation to generation because of acclimation to a new culture.  Grandma Tomasa did her best to keep tradition alive.  She made the most delicious authentic food everyday and made enough for everyone.  Her heart was always so full of compassion.  I used to love watching her light prayer candles with the beautiful illustrations of saints and Mother Mary on them.  She would kneel down with her rosary between her palms and pray for everyone she loved.  It was beautiful to witness her heartfelt tradition.  She would be so proud to see me following my divine passions, especially in Mexico! 
 It's such a gift to have the opportunity to learn more about my roots in a very artistic way. My son Milo will be traveling with me.  I'm so over the moon he'll get to learn about where his great grandmother is from on top of the gift of exposure to another country.  It's really important to me that he gets to experience new places, culture and language.  It's also a true blessing that he gets to be right next to me watching and learning invaluable information while we journey.
   Air travel to and from Mexico is $429.  Travel while in Mexico is $400.  Lodging for a month staying at air bnbs and such, will be $500.  Food for Milo and I will be $400. The cost of art supplies and shipping materials is $600.  Kickstarter fees will be $143.30.  That brings the venture to a grand total of $2,329.  
  I'm so thankful for this incredible venture.  I'm looking forward to painting for all of you.  Thank you for your contribution to this project and supporting my artistic soul path. And most of all thank you for loving art.

Hire Y'all is a professional network aiming to connect retail and service industry employees with hiring managers. We've created a pretty cool employment service platform, tailored it towards our industry, and optimized the search process making it easier to find the right fit for job-seekers and employers alike. 
How'd We Get Started?
We have deep roots in the Dallas retail industry. We also know how difficult it is to find productive, conscientious, and hard-working employees. Platforms are constantly raising prices from the upwards of $75+ per post, without any guarantee of quality of talent. That's why we started Hire Y'all. We wanted to make it easier and affordable to find all-star employees. 
Why Are We Raising Funds?
We have watched Hire Y'all grow in Dallas with our internal efforts. The number of active user job-seekers has grown steadily, as has the number of business users. But we're not satisfied yet - we want to see Hire Y'all grow to the next level. For that reason, we want to raise money to hire a Sales team. By leveraging their relationships, our sales team will work towards locking in corporate accounts and expanding growth to the next level. We started in Dallas and have seen surprising growth, so we are confident that with the right sales team we can grow Hire Y'all into an even greater success. "

309,1391360022,"I am the artist David Willardson 

I feel most inspired by the artists Claus Oldenburg and Richard Tuttle. They have been most influential in giving me the insight into the void where most of my inspiration comes from.

My works of art should fall into the category or abstract expressionism.
To complete my “Elegant Surprise” series, I would like to create 6 more works to be shown in this series. One of those works will be a 5’9” tall female sculpture with this material. She will ultimately complete this series.

I like to create small works that look like they are too heavy to hang on a wall but in fact they are very light.. I feel that they should look you in the face when you look at them. I also believe that they are humble and playful and that they invite you to reconsider your view when you confront them.
Different views will create a different experience in that you should not get the same experience from your previous view.I am a big believer in up cycling and all of my “Elegant Surprise” works will involve up cycling.
I feel that I am making something of importance with this new medium that I love to work with. Most of my experience in sculpture has been in clay. In high school I won an Art “Award of Excellence” in a State High School competition where my work of art was the only sculpture out of all of the different mediums to get an award. That sculpture is called facial expressions. That award also brought much attention from universities to my talent. Facial expressions has 365 different heads that form a vase and everyone who views it gets quite a different experience. I want those who view my works have a desire to interact with it in many ways such as touching it and even falling in love with it which many have told me that they have.

My artwork is created with an inward experience from an exterior experience that I have had. I feel that each one of my pieces has its own personal expression that comes from a part of my sublimation. IT has helped me develop as an individual finding a spiritual redirection which is important for everyone to experience. Creating artwork and viewing artwork is a spiritual experience for me transforming me into a different dimension when I need that escape.
My goal with Kickstarter is to raise enough money to get into a gallery and have a show, transportation costs, and finish my collection to be shown at the gallery."
310,1101777555,"THE STORY
Welcome to the world of Scissor Sisters, a fantastical reality where the time stream is a living and well-traveled path between wheres and whens. We think you'll like it here, and we'd love for you to stay, check the place out and help us fund printing of this massive, sweeping story. 
Last Summer, with the help of 102 generous Backers, we successfully funded Scissor Sisters, a 120-page graphic novel - the story of Candi and Ash, a pair of women separated by millennia but whose love is an inevitability. They are thrown together in the least likely of times and places and hunted by The Continuum, a cross-time conspiracy of the elite and the sinister deeply frightened of the destiny of the couple they refer to as The Sisters.
The Original Scissor Sisters Graphic Novel - Available in a Bundle with Swan Song at the $25 Reward Tier!
We loved it so much – and got so much terrific feedback on it – that we decided to continue the story in the 54-page graphic novel, Scissor Sisters: Swan Song. This new volume follows the time-tripping assassin Cygnet, vanquished by the Sisters to ancient times in our first chapter, her only ally a friend of one of the Sisters. Faced with traitors to her wicked Master, Cygnet must steal a powerful mask to repair her time-traveling armor and resume her quest to fulfill her mission and destroy the Sisters.
THE PROJECT
The Star of the Show - Scissor Sisters: Swan Song!
Scissor Sisters: Swan Song is written by Kevin LaPorte (Vicious Circus, Last Ride for Horsemen, Roadkill du Jour, Scales of Time, and The Absentee) and illustrated by Marvel and DC veteran Rich Perotta (Scales of Time, The Ray, Deadpool) with colors by Vito Potenza. Scissor Sisters  was co-created by Erica J. Heflin (Zenescope's Wonderland, Cosmic Times' Flesh of White, and Antithesis). Consider it rated PG-13 for violence/gore and adult themes.
This is the second of several planned volumes of Scissor Sisters, all with the same committed team of creators, and our plans go far beyond crowdfunding, to include broad distribution through comic shops and other retail channels! But, first, we have to pay for the initial print run, which is the purpose of this Kickstarter campaign and where you come in!
THE PREVIEW
Cygnet stalks her prey...
  ...and manipulates the very hands of time to secure her enemies...
  ...frozen in the numbers of her clock, they fall...
  ...her assassin's skills unveiled, she tightens her temporary alliance...

312,86293262,"This Kickstarter campaign is designed to help artist Kaz McCue self-publish a book of his photographic work entitled “Photographic Impression from M-22.” This will be a 96-page hardcover book with the dimensions of 10""x10"".
Kaz has lived in northwestern Michigan for the past ten years and has lived in Leelanau County for the past five years. Through all of this time Michigan State Highway M-22 has been at the center of his photographic explorations and he has used this meandering 119 mile motorway to search out the many niches and environs that exist in this part of Michigan. Most of M-22 runs through Leelanau County, which is noted as one of the most beautiful places in America. This remote destination features farms, vineyards, fruit orchards, small towns, forests, the shores of Lake Michigan, and Sleeping Bears Dunes National Lakeshore. 
For those that live here–and for many who visit this area–M-22 is not simply the designation of this trunkline state highway but it has become a symbol for a simpler, more down-to-earth way of life and an emblem for the beauty that exists in this corner of northern Michigan affectionately called “the pinkie.”
As a resident of Leelanau County, Kaz notes that; ""As an artist, I have been struck by the ever-changing light, the continual evolution of the seasons, the quietness of place and time. Being out in nature and exploring this area has taken me to unexpected places in a familiar environment. The more I explore, the more I discover.""
Indeed, M-22 has found a place in Kaz's heart that is so comfortable, so familiar. This book, then, is a record of his ongoing relationship with this place and the road that helps to connect him with all of its charms. ""The images contained within this book chronicle my time here and each one is a detail of a memory that I gladly share through this project."""
313,307702148,"As advertised, this book will try its best to KILL you. Now that we've gotten that out of the way, we can get down to business. I'm not a real doctor, but I assume that when your mind is blown, your brain explodes. I could be mistaken, but when the human brain explodes, you're fairly certain to shuffle off the mortal coil. Trust me, it doesn't benefit me in the least for you to die. In fact, I'm counting on you, oh courageous reader, to live.
""I'm not here to drop yet another hammer on the evils of humanity, nor to offer an emotional and hopeful appeal for peace and utopia through text. My intent and aspiration in this project is to take the most hotly contested, most chaos-inducing, and most ""difficult"" to answer questions of life, and to answer them. How is this different from so many other past attempts to bring humankind together? Because this time, it's going to WORK.
I am an average human being. This statement is not meant to belittle myself, but to paint a picture of similarity between us all. It takes only a few moments of personal thought to establish the things we need in life, and the things we want in living it. Easy enough. The real challenge rests in exercising those desires, and THAT is only difficult because the workings of the world seem constructed to directly resist us from achieving our goals.
It doesn't take hundreds of chapters of exhaustingly researched facts, a psychological breakdown of the human condition, or an uber-intellectual denouncement of the world at large. Addressing and solving the world's problems can (and shall) be done with simplicity. All it takes is a casual digital stroll around YouTube, Reddit, Twitter or Facebook to observe the attitude of the world at large.
This Book Will KILL You is a straightforward, sensible, and modern attempt to communicate with each and every human being that it can reach. Ten is an excellent number, and holds a feeling of completion in itself. For that reason, I have established ten points to be addressed in this first installment. I believe that offering these ten points in a rational, non-biased conversation with the reader will invoke the spirit of commonality in us all. They are:
1. Religion. No, not a discussion of why religion is good or bad, but a way for us all to cope with our differences in the myriad views on our origins, our purpose, and our destiny. It's not hard, and it makes no excuses for those who use it as a means to inflict harm on others.
2. Politics. Wow, numbers one and two are the topics that are generally held to be the worst possible discussion points in polite conversation. Too bad, because they are both so relevant to how and why we live our lives, and I've found a way to make them easy to digest, and without ruling any one ideology out as invalid or foolish. Winning.
3. Love. How many times in just the past decade has the subject of interpersonal love been muddied with violence, hatred and sensationalism. No longer. If hearing how easy it is to live alongside your fellow human beings despite your sexual and emotional differences will kill you, chapter three is the end for you, friend.
4. Children. Are they, or are they not the future? OUR future, as the next chapter in the story of human kind.. why then is there no standard for the aspects of their growth that will either help them become thoughtful, creative, inspired, loving builders.. or pessimistic and intolerant psychopaths. The latter dies out with THIS generation, or are converted to the former.
5. Money. Despite the branding of money as the ultimate evil, and the weapon of injustice, money is honestly meant to be tracker for one's productivity and helpfulness to the whole. That simple standard ideal has been thoroughly corrupted, but in just a few easy conversations, we can get back on track. For a nominal fee, of course ;)
6. Craziness. A general term, but what it describes is a foreign idea to no one. People have been crazy since the first batch of us came around, and won't cease to be any time soon. Coping with craziness will help us all do everything possible to counteract the negativity it spreads, and just may aid us in significantly diminishing human lunacy to a more manageable level.
7. Violence. Like the Muppet formerly known as Cookie Monster (Now Veggie Monster) informs youngsters, cookies are a ""sometimes"" food. Likewise, the human currently known as Dave says violence is a ""sometimes"" answer. When we really get down into the nitty-gritty of change and enlightenment, there are some people that are so stuck in their ways that they will resist to the bitter end, opting for destruction and menace rather than coexist with those that differ from them. For those people, I invoke not a bloodbath with hot lead and explosives, but a fair, honest and straightforward round of fisticuffs. Or, even better, vie for dominance on the latest first person shooter. Either way, the way to deal with, and eventually curb human violence, is laid out for generations young and old. Let's not repeat our past mistakes here, guys.
8. Trust. Thanks to information availability in a decent portion of the planet, we have access to great spans of information about the past, present and future. Most of it details the horrors of human cruelty, and what some call 'mindless' drivel to satisfy the masses. I would argue that there are as many theories detailing the secrecy, conspiracy, and underhandedness of our unseen rulers as there are examples of 7+ billion other human beings doing all they can to survive and thrive. In discussing trusting in yourself, and in the rest of your species, in the hope of helping humans realize that we have only to unite to succeed at well.. everything.
9. The Past. Whew, how about our ancestors, right? So caught up in the need for more territory, more wealth, more legacy, that a fraction of a percent of us (in the past) wrought misery and slaughter on one another through the use of others with iron and fire. There are as many stories of conquest, betrayal, enslavement and violent nationalism as there are nations past and present. While sometimes exciting, horrifying or dramatic to read and relive, is this what we want future generations to remember us for? We have ascended past this stage, whether you might think so or not, but a few simple discussions about our roots may damn well put our present to rights. No sugar-coating, bias or favoritism to be found.
10. The Future. How bright and beautiful it could be. How miserable, dark and desolate as well. Only by taking the time now, here and with one another in cooperation, do we stand to reach the gilded images of luxury and glory that our predecessors envisioned for us. It won't take long. No more than the final chapter of ten in a brief, simple book as a matter of fact. We can have that conversation, you and I, and I promise not to fill it full of sugary sweet pictures of utopia. This is a real portrait of our timeline if we get off our collective asses and stop being ridiculous. Sounds impossible, but I disagree!"""
314,1048826825,"This is my passion and my way of giving back to the Veteran community with whom I have served and have revered all my life. I wanted to share a story of every Veteran: An eternal struggle with the transition from fighting the war abroad to the internal war at home. Veterans have fought wars for many different reasons and their experiences are as varied. Some fought, some did not, some return with survivor’s guilt, some with demons, others return gravely wounded, and some return physically unscathed. But we all struggle with coming home physically and emotionally, usually upset at how much society has changed, often perceived for the worse. It is only after the internal conflict, the war within oneself, that we realize it is not society that has so greatly changed, it is not society with whom we are so upset, but rather, it is ourselves. 
  A man, changed forever by the scars of battle returns home after many years of war to find his city unrecognizable, seemingly not what it once was. Feeling betrayed by a substandard society he fought to defend and of the corruption by those who sent him to fight, Death Trap embarks on a mission to carve out a bloody path to redemption for both his city and himself...and to perhaps regain something he has lost.
  Years of war have revealed our character mysteriously unable to die; however, haunted by the experiences of war, the mental and emotional scars left by the never ending picture show of death and chaos struggling to consume his every thought, have rendered our character incapable of experiencing any emotion other than the burning rage that fuels his mission. Death Trap must harness the inferno of hate that he uses to lay waste to a corrupt and degenerate society before it consumes him, and his humanity, forever blurring the line between the enemy and for those whom he is fighting...

315,211541797,"Do What You Want is a one-off magazine, curated and edited by author and food writer Ruby Tandoh and her partner Leah Pritchard, to raise money for the mental health charities Mind, Beat and some smaller local charities and initiatives. It features an interview with writer and actress Mara Wilson; food writers Diana Henry (Sunday Telegraph), Tejal Rao (NY Times) and Joanna Weinberg (The Times); Heather Havrilesky (Ask Polly, NY Mag); Laura Snapes (Pitchfork, Rookie); and illustrations from Laura Callaghan (NYLON, Refinery 29), Rose Blake (The New York Times, Disney) and Julia Scheele (Vice, The Guardian).
From Ruby: “Over the years we have both suffered from mental health problems and one of the most difficult things about those times was how difficult it was to seek help, and how isolating the illness was. We both know first hand the stigma of being mentally ill, of not being able to be honest with friends and family about why you have withdrawn from work, social plans, studies, relationships. Although we have grown up in a generation that is more aware of mental health (and illness) than ever, we still felt that social pressure to “just cheer up” acutely. There is a real lack of understanding about the many different ways that mental illness can manifest, the things that trigger it, and what can be done to help.” 
From Leah: “Even for those who haven’t personally experienced mental ill health, we all know someone who has. So many of us suffer in silence because we’re afraid of how people might react. That’s why we wanted to make this magazine. As well as raising money for charities that help those with mental health problems, we wanted to make something that would provide a channel for people to engage with discussions around mental health and give a platform to those suffering from mental illness. As someone who has suffered trauma, and experienced anxiety and depression, my hope is that the magazine will promote empowerment and compassion in the face of the stigma, misinformation and oppression that issues around mental health so often carry.”
We have writers and editors on board already from the Guardian, New York magazine, the New York Times, Rolling Stone, Rookie, and Pitchfork. Some of the features include: Why Should I Go to Therapy? by Heather Havrilesky, the writer behind The Cut’s Ask Polly; recipes for taking care of yourself, by Ruby Tandoh, Diana Henry, Tejal Rao, Izy Hossack, and more; The Many Faces of Eating Disorders, showing how they can affect anyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, age, race, and size; and The Cost of Care, interviewing Sally Burke of Channel 4’s Kids on the Edge, and investigating mental health provision in the North East.
Do What You Want will be released in April, retailing at £7, with all profit going to charity.
What do we need money for?
We want to make sure that we maximise the amount of the proceeds from sales of the zine that will go to charity. With that in mind, we're calling for businesses and individuals to come forward and donate whatever they can to help us meet printing costs in advance, so that 100% of proceeds from sales can go direct to Mind, Beat, and other smaller mental health initiatives. We (Ruby and Leah) as well as all of our writers, illustrators, editors and designers are working for free, donating our time to make this project happen. We hope that you can help it become a reality!"

        Straight to the goods!
Evadrion was a rebellious Angel until her memories were taken. Her winged peers have brought her back to the light but keep her in the dark. The imminent threat of the Diabolics keeps her under control. She wants to help, truly! But an Angel becomes more trouble than she’s worth when too many questions are asked...
The story is rated R for the occasional sex and boobs. Blood and gore is common but never gratuitous.
Authorities That Be includes the first and complete story arc of Angels Power finally printed in a perfect-bound softcover.
310+ full color, richly painted pages, with a gloss.
6.75 x 9.75.
An exquisite wraparound cover.
Glossy paper.
6"" French folds for a beautiful extension of the art and it works as  bookmarks!

  Hi! I’m Amélie Hutt.
Originally from Belgium, I’ve been living in California for over ten years now. The sun is a little harsh on my fragile amphibian skin (Belgium is cold and rainy! Don’t go!! We want the chocolate all for ourselves!) so I stay in my cave all day and paint at night, dreaming of real chocolate.

I’ve been working as a professional illustrator since 2012, contributing to super cool projects like Lord of the Rings LCG, Game of Thrones LCG, Star Wars LCG, Android Netrunner, Fury of Dracula...
Need more? You can see the rest of my illustration work at: https://www.artstation.com/artist/smirt
Why do I make comics?
High school was hell for me so I spent the whole time inside of my head, building up the place of birth of Evadrion, Metatron and Azazel...
I always found myself at home with images, drawing everyday for as long as I can remember.

People used to tell me: “You should draw comics.” Belgium is the birth place of European comics if you will (Tintin, Astérix & Obélix, ...) but for some reason, it never clicked. I felt disconnected.
It's only after looking at amazing webcomics like SSSS (Minna Sundberg), Unsounded (Ashley Cope) and Spindrift (Elsa Kroese/Charlotte E. English), all amazing artists, that I realized I didn’t have to fit into a mold. I could do it my own way!

Why Kickstarter?I want this book to be as beautiful as I envisioned it. To make it a reality, I need the funds to hire the talented KrakenPrint for a 500 offset print run. Because I’m not big on conventions, (Out of my cave?? Imagine that!) participating to this Kickstarter is your guaranteed opportunity to get your own copy of this book. Not only that but this campaign is the only place to acquire the Kickstarter-exclusive cover variant of the Graïnne, with a numbered and signed bookplate. Amazing. And rare! Oh.
What will the funds be used for?
58% of the funds are for printing alone because it's such a nice thick book. A good 28% goes into shipping because it's a HEAVY 2 lbs book! (But what's more seductive than a thick, heavy book? Please answer that for me.)
The remaining 14% goes into fees and contingencies, in case anything happens. It's good to be cautious.
     Did you need a taste? Oh, but please! Take a peek, a good bite!

317,1409304825,"The Influencers Movement (TIM) makes influencers marketing accessible for everyone in the most honest and cost-effective way. 
TIM will be a revolutionary online platform that offers an open, worldwide marketplace and all the tools both influencers, mediating agencies and clients need in order to efficiently match and manage collaborations. So, from pitching to monitoring and from analyses to payments, TIM does all the work for you.
Technology will enable TIM to make sure influencers (bloggers, vloggers and social media influencers) will keep their rewards 100% and clients will only be paying a set fee in order to use the platform.
An open market will improve efficiency and relevance in influencers marketing. With TIM, inspiration will be available for the right audience, at the right place, in the form of the most valuable content.
We feel the urge to start a movement because we believe that only by joining forces, we can realize an honest and open marketplace like TIM and stop the unnecessary commissioning. We invite you to join the movement: share TIM's story and enthuse other people to fund TIM's dream as well. Every backer counts!
TIM is a movement, a platform and a manager. Huh? Yes, TIM will be all that! Because our experience at our first company Bloggers Network has taught us that influencers, as well as brands and mediating agencies need a superhero like TIM!
So, how does TIM work? First, TIM THE MOVEMENT, is created to make a change in the way we approach influencers marketing. 

Why do we need a movement? Working together with influencers to spread your story as a brand could potentially be the most credible and effective marketing asset of the future. Unfortunately, it is not that simple. The problem comes down to this: an unnecessary amount of time and money is lost for all parties involved.

Why? Well, first of all, most brands lack knowledge on how, but most of all, which influencers they should approach for their campaigns. Media-, PR- and advertising agencies have tried to meet the needs of brands by mediating between them. But there are still no tools available to efficiently manage all the processes or to get an overview of the whole influencers market. Probably that is why most agencies still take up to an average of 40% of the financial contributions given to the influencers.

On the other side, the influencers. Apart from the fact that they are earning less than they should, they also lose a lot of time by going through an overload of irrelevant requests on a daily basis. With the result that they miss out on campaigns that would truly add value to their blog, vlog or social media channel.
The movement is created to show everyone how many influencers, brands and mediators would want influencers marketing to be more accessible and cost-effective. Also, we want to create awareness of the value of influencers marketing. TIM's motto: Credits to the creators!
Second, TIM THE PLATFORM. We have everything in place to build the worldwide influencers marketplace. A platform that will allow influencers to get an overview of all possible campaigns they can pitch on. On the other side, it will enable clients (brands and mediating agencies) to publish their campaigns anytime and anyway they would want and to find out by their selves which influencer would fit their campaign best.   
Clients will publish campaigns on the marketplace
Influencers will pitch on campaigns they love & determine their own rates per campaign component.
And last but not least, we need TIM THE MANAGER, to efficiently manage all the processes involved in a collaboration. TIM will offer all the tools our clients and influencers would need.
Pitching tool
With only one click, influencers can pitch on a campaign. TIM knows their members, so information about themselves, their channel and statistics are already known and forwarded by the system. Also, TIM wants influencers to be in control over what they earn per campaign. Influencers can adjust their rates per campaign, which they will get to keep for the full 100%.
Matching tool
TIM has access to real-time statistics of all subscribed influencers. These real-time statistics do not only include reach, but also SEO value, engagement and references. The client can choose with which influencer they would want to work with.
Briefing tool:
TIM provides all the tools to efficiently keep in touch with each other. As an influencer you can find all the instructions per campaign in the briefing tool. And as a client you can easily send new information regarding to their campaigns.
Monitoring tool:
Some clients want to check content before it will be published. Via the monitoring tool influencers can easily sent their content to the client and clients can suggest potential adjustments.
Analysis tool:
One of the most important tools from our clients' wishlist: a tool that provides them with analyses of the results of their campaigns. Conversion, CTR, views, engagement, the analysis tool provides all the information you need.
Feedback tool:
References are very important for influencers to build a reputation on TIM, but also to improve their work. It's not mandatory, but we do kindly request clients to rate the influencers' work. 
Payment tool:
And this is a tool that we found very important for both influencers and clients. TIM will take care of your financial administration! All campaigns will be handled by the invoice and payment system of TIM at once. No more hassling with invoices and e-mailing, TIM will take care of it from now on.
Circle tool:
Imagine, you're an influencer; maybe you would want to only receive campaigns of your preferred PR- and media agencies. Or maybe you would not want to miss out on any campaign of your favorite brand. Well, than you can easily request access to the circles of those clients and get a notification whenever they publish a new campaign. On the other hand, brands and mediators will be able to keep in touch with their favourite influencers. A win-win situation!
On March 28th, 2015, The Influencers Movement was selected as one of the three finalists for the TEDxAmsterdam Women Startup Awards at the preliminary rounds of this contest. 
The goal of the Startup Awards is to assist women in making the transition from an idea into a business, but also to provide them with an opportunity and having the chance to present a TED Talk during the TEDxAmsterdamWomen event on May 29th at the Okura Hotel in Amsterdam. In addition there will be offered coaching, assistance with crowdfunding, mentorship by partners like TomTom, ING and PWC and several other great prizes.
This Kickstarter campaign is an important part of this competition. All three finalists will launch a campaign on Kickstarter from april 20 till may 18 and the number of backers, impact, engagement and of course the success of this campaign will increase our chances of winning the Startup Awards!
Do you want to show your support at the finals on May 29? Registration is now open on the website of TEDx Amsterdam Women. And for our international followers, it will also be possible to livestream the TED talk of Myrthe and Dorit. 
The Influencers Movement was founded because we feel the urge to bring a positive change into the influencers market, based on the needs and interests of the influencers, and not based on the sole purpose of earning money. Curious why you - as an influencer - will love TIM? 
Get to keep 100% of your self chosen financial rewards 
Only get notifications of campaigns that you love
Get to pitch on all campaigns and events worldwide
Stay in touch with your favorite brands, PR- and media agencies
Gain financial and legal security
Create a portfolio with corresponding references and statistics
Get a real-time mediakit (incl. content, social & display advertising)
After a year of experience in consulting brands in what way they could best collaborate with influencers, we have noticed there is one big universal problem: an unnecessary amount of time and money is lost by finding the right influencers and managing the processes involved in collaborations. Curious how TIM will solve this problem for all of you brands?
Publish a campaign on the marketplace by yourself anytime, anyway you want.
A campaign can include a combination of content, social and display advertising.
Rewards for the influencers can be a barterdeal, financial reward or an invitation for your event.
Get access to the whole influencers market on one platform.
Pay per campaign or subscribe so you'll be able to use TIM's tools on a continuous basis.
Get access to realtime statistics of the influencers, that have pitched on your campaign, in advance.
Stay in touch with the influencers you'll work with through the briefing tool.
Monitor the content before publication by using the monitoring tool.
Evaluate the statistics (CTR, Engagement, Views etc.) of your campaign with the evaluation tool.
All payments will be handled automatically by TIM.
Stay in touch with your favorite influencers by creating a circle.
We want to make influencers marketing more accessible, just like a lot of media- PR- and advertising agencies have already been trying to do for many years. 
Unfortunately, most of these mediating agencies don't have access to software that manage the processes in an effective way. This still causes the current collaborations made by mediating agencies to be rather time and cost ineffective. Probably that's why most of the mediators still take up to an average of 40% of the financial rewards of the influencers. 
Besides that, we have noticed that contracts of these agencies restrict influencers to accept requests of other parties. Isn't that a shame? Wouldn't everyone profit from an open market where the focus lies on the most relevant match?
We think media- PR- and advertising agencies play a crucial role in consulting brands in what way a campaign could be established in the most profitable and relevant way. We don't want to replace these agencies, we want to provide them with tools to efficiently manage their processes. In fact, we think mediating agencies could potentially be the most successful users of TIM, because they already know how to set up a successful campaign and select the most relevant influencers.
We also know the value of niches. We understand that a PR agency that focusses on high fashion would only want to address the influencers they already know. That's why we created 'circles'. All clients will be able to invite their own influencers into their circle so they can publish a campaign only for them and still profit from all the tools TIM provides.
In short, mediating agencies will love TIM because:
Circles will enable mediators to invite their already connected influencers into their circle.
TIM's tools will help them to manage collaborations in a more efficient way.
Access to not only their own circle, but the public network as well.
(Also see all the reasons we have summed up in the section above at 'Brands ♥ TIM')
With the help of TIM’s efficient tools, we can stop the unnecessary commissioning. So, TIM does not benefit from the financial contributions given to the influencers, TIM strives for the influencers to earn what they deserve: 100% of their rewards!
Only clients will pay a set fee in order to use TIM. €500,- per campaign, or clients can subscribe to a TIM BASIC, TIM PLUS or a TIM ULTIMATE account where they’ll be able to use TIM's tools on a continuous basis and get the opportunity to start a circle. 
Based on a platform that has all the tools as presented above (TIM's dream), the costs for clients could be:
 Ok, what’s the catch? There is none. TIM is just a really good guy that wants to make the influencers world a better and more accessible place.
Have you seen Derek Siver's TED-talk: How to start a movement? Than you must know how important you all - as the first followers - are for TIM! It's incredibly appreciated if you show the world that you have joined TIM. How? Write a little blog, film a vlog or share an update on social media with the hashtag #JoinTIM. Also you can follow, like and share our updates on:

Derek Sivers: ""if you notice that the first follower is actually an underestimated form of leadership in itself. It takes guts to stand out like that. The first follower is what transforms a lone nut into a leader.""
We believe that every little bit helps and that by joining forces we can establish major things. That is why TIM has decided that funding from €1,- is a major help already. Of course you are more than welcome to donate more! We have thought of some nice rewards, but, we did have kept in mind that the biggest reward we can offer all you guy's, is our limitless dedication to building the best platform possible!
We have set our funding goal at €10.000,- but we are striving to go beyond this amount and reach a total of €150.000,- in order to create TIM's dream as described above.
By reaching our first goal of €10.000,- we will already be able to launch the first, basic version on which we can built further: the marketplace. Unfortunately, for €10.000 ,- we won't be able to build the tools as presented above yet. So, the more money we'll raise, the faster and better we'll be able to launch TIM's dream. Every cent counts!
Nice to meet you! We are Dorit Roest and Myrthe Stapper, the proud founders of The Influencers Movement and Bloggers Network. Both 25 years old, living in Amsterdam and absolutely nuts about blogs, vlogs and social media.
But, with our experience as freelancers in marketing, sales and journalism we have also noticed that collaborations between influencers and brands are still realized in a conservative, inefficient way. Why isn't influencers marketing accessible for everyone?
That’s why, one year ago, Dorit as a foodblogger of Dolly's Dish and Myrthe as a sales fanatic, started our first company Bloggers Network. We created a central database of the Dutch and Belgian bloggers market and started to switch supply and demand by building a marketplace filled with campaigns where the bloggers could pitch on.
And with success. For the past 9 months we completed more then 60 successful campaigns and our biggest pride: With 1.300 bloggers we are already the biggest network of bloggers in the Netherlands.
But we also know that there’s a lot more work to do. So now it’s time to not only create a movement in the Netherlands, but worldwide! That’s why we created The Influencers Movement! With TIM we want to take Bloggers Network’s mission to the next level.
From left to right: Roos, Vivienne, Dorit, Myrthe, Kelly, Wouter
And let us introduce to you, our team:
Vivienne Pickkers 
First, Vivienne, our talented designer that also showed her talents in sales and account management already. By showing she's a great allrounder, Viev has already proven to be a great asset of our team.
Kelly Camfferman 
Our other account manager, and successful foodblogger of Goodfoodlove, Kelly uses all of her energy - and that's a lot - to help other influencers by matching them to the most relevant campaigns. Kelly will take every opportunity she has to enthuse other people about Bloggers Network and of course... Our beloved TIM.
Roos van 't Hof 
Roos is our creative, strategic and organizational brain and although we all love TIM very much, Roos might love him most and does everything in her power to fulfill TIM's dream! 
Wouter Offringa 
Wouter is our talent on social media, marketing and project management. His down to earth view on everything brings some much-needed testosterone into our team. 
Future CTO
At this moment we are also very close to a deal with our future CTO, let us tell you this already... He/she can work wonders! With this CTO we also bring a team of talented and professional technological experts into our company. We hope to bring you more information about this soon!
Ok... This was TIM's story! Just one more recap (Hint: this could make some nice sharing-material on social media!). Looking forward to welcome you to our movement soon!"
318,1702331521,"      Life imitates art. Or is it the other way around?  Both adventures have begun.  Through the amazing platform of Kickstarter, and with your awesome support, my lifelong dream to create a fictional universe for a comic book based adventure has become reality with the release and success of the first volume of Nuns vs Nurses. The support and feedback I received on the first book was overwhelmingly positive. You funded the project and then told me you were glad you did and wanted more. So here it is.  Now the adventure continues in the eagerly awaited second chapter: Nuns vs Nurses Volume 2.   
I am thrilled to have a chance to tell this story.  With your continued support and interest in Volume 2 I will be able to conclude the initial 3 part story arc as soon as possible.  As with the first book, I have actually already taken the hit of personally funding the creative work of this chapter myself.  This story is happening simply because I could no longer resist the creative urge to produce it.  With the creative aspects completed it relieves you of any  traditional worries in supporting the work. Your support will pay for printing, distribution, the campaign rewards, and the continued promotion of the project.  It will also help me as I take the time needed to complete the third chapter with the thought and care that I feel will make it the most satisfying to all of us.
Despite going over my goal on the funding for Vol. 1,  I set a much lower funding goal on this campaign. The first chapter had a lot of momentum in support from people who love me and wanted to see this get off the ground.  The long term success will have to come from a growing crowd made of curious readers willing to invest in only the book and rewards.
Make no mistake, I need all the support possible to be able to complete this story and promote it properly so please find any reason you can to participate at the highest levels.  All support is needed and appreciated, but the best support I can get is, after you choose your own reward level, for you to share this page with anyone you know who has an interest reading something fun.  If you have read volume 1, tell everyone you loved it and they should read it too.  Tell them how cool Kickstarter is and that you support this project. Better yet buy them a copy by letting me know you are adding on $15 to any of the packages for each copy.  I""ll do my best to get you any gift copies of Vol 1 before Christmas if possible.  
Whether you are a new reader or coming back for more fun, I hope the story and characters find a way into your heart and affect you in a positive way.  That is the ultimate goal of making this dream come true.  It seems to be working.  Thanks for your continued support.  I think you will find Volume 2 is worth it.  Never miss the middle chapter.  I've seen it.  I'm sure you will love it.  Cary."
319,1595087640," Hello!  My Name is Gary Morgan. I'm an artist from Pittsburgh PA.  All my life I have been fascinated with fantasy, horror and comic books.  Like most nerdy kids in the eighties, Batman, The Uncanny X-men and the Amazing Spider-man were high on the list of must haves!  I tried my hardest to emulate artists such as Arthur Adams, Bill Sienkiewicz, John Buscema and John Byrne.   The talents of other great artist icons enamored me as well.  Frank Frazetta, Joe Jusko, the Hildebrandt Brothers and   Jeffrey Catherine Jones were always in arms reach. 
  My biggest influence however, is  Bernie Wrightson.  Everything he did was magic. I would spend hours looking at The Frankenstein illustrations, in awe of the immense detail involved.  I met him at a comic convention in Baltimore one year, he was such a nice guy!
     During my teenage years I fell in love with the written word as well.  I would read stories by J.R.R. Tolkien,  Richard Mattheson, Clive Barker and of course Stephen King.  Later I would discover Neil Gaimen.  His comic book The Sandman would become my favorite of all time.  
  I have always  enjoyed creating art and stories, but around eight years ago I made it a goal of mine to  one day become a full time artist.  I'm still on that road, learning new things everyday.  Getting a few jobs illustrating books and even trying my hand at  children books. www.dynamicresources.org 
   I love setting up at  comic-cons and art festivals.  Its such an exciting  feeling to put your work on display for all to look at. That's what being a visual artist is, right?  All the insecurities and fears met head on,  showing the world something held special to you.  Some won't like it, which is fine, but others will!  And that's what its all about. Connecting with people on another level. 
  I know we are living in some crazy times, this virus has changed every aspect of our lives.  I miss connecting with people and sharing my passion to create. That's what made me finally put together this book. Its always been on my to do list, but with your help I hope to make it a reality.  
  The work is all done. I picked out my favorites to make a 62 page book. With over 70 images , both color and black and white.   That's were you come in... I'm doing this kickstarter to help with the printing cost.  The book will be 8.5 by 11 inches, printed on 100# paper, with a soft cover.  I decided to make the rewards simple.  

 REWARD BREAKDOWN
  The first level is an 11"" by 14"" high quality print for 15 dollars.  You can choose from these prints I have listed. It will be signed and is printed on a nice,  photo paper stock.  
    The second level is 25 dollars. For this amount you will receive a copy of the book with a small , one of a kind sketch.  The book measures at 8.5 "" by 11"" with 62 pages of both color and black and white images. It will be printed on durable 100# paper , perfect bound with soft cover.

  The third level is 35 dollars. For this amount you will receive the first two levels combined, The book and a print of your choice from the above list.

  The fourth  level is the best bang for your buck! It is 75 dollars and you will receive the previous rewards mentioned, along with an original  9"" by 12"" piece with a single character of your choice in black and white  with gray wash( and probably a splash of color).  There are only 25 spots available, so act fast!!
 EXAMPLES


     The fifth level is broken into  three special rewards.  For 125 dollars you can receive the book and one of these originals 1. Pans Labyrinth  2. Sandman and Death  3. Swamp Thing . They are each 9"" by 12"" graphite on multi media paper.  It took me around 7 or 8 hours to finish each one. This is a steal of a deal...practically getting the book for little to no cost!!
   Thanks so much for taking the time to look at my campaign!  It was a lot of fun putting together and if you did support me, I greatly appreciate it!!  Take care !!

 EN- The really best thing about kickstarter is that no money is taken from your account when you first pledge, the money is only taken if the project is funded at the end date. So during the campaign you can change your mind and choose more or less pins.
For now you can contribute to this project through different rewards by purchasing 1 to 4 pins. But if we reached the 4 goals, news pins will be add.
          All pins cost 11€ except for early birds (limited quantity) pledges, it's 10€ for them. All pins that will not be sell, would be available on my Etsy shop for 12€.

FR- Le meilleur dans kickstarter est que vous n'êtes pas débité lorsque vous contribuez, l'argent sera uniquement prelevé si le projet sera totallement financé à la fin de la campagne.

322,1365326572,"A MESSAGE FROM THE ROOFTOP FILMS STAFF:
Support Rooftop Films as we embark on our 22nd year of bringing spectacular and meaningful film and music events to the roofs, streets, parks, and waterways of New York City.
Do you want to sit at home alone streaming movies on your laptop, or do you want to meet up with hundreds of interesting people and together get wrapped up in a film glowing on a giant screen? Do you want to be hushed up in some boring black box, or do you want to hang out on the roof of a 100-year-old high school while the city churns below, the wide-open sky stretching out above? Do you want to get kicked out of the theater for the next seating, or do you want to hang out with the filmmakers at an after-party with free drinks? Do you want the same old passive movie experience, or do you want to be a part of something more?
WHO WE ARE 
Rooftop Films is a Brooklyn based nonprofit whose mission is to engage diverse communities by showing independent films in amazing outdoor locations throughout New York City. We are best known for the Rooftop Films Summer Series, an annual, outdoor, summer-long film festival that showcases the best new independent and foreign films in the world on rooftops and in other scenic locations. That massive series features more than 100 new films in 15 different locations and attracts tens of thousands of attendees—and almost all of the planning and preparation for that series is done by 7 year-round employees who work their butts off all year long.
Even if that was all we did, we would still need your help. But we also do so much more..
Through the Rooftop Films Community Fund we offer equipment and our event production expertise at low rates and even free to artists, nonprofits, and community groups. These events include more than 50 additional, FREE, large scale partner events and community happenings in locations throughout NYC.
And through the Rooftop Filmmakers’ Fund, Rooftop works to foster talent in the independent filmmaking community by providing more than $200,000 worth of cash and services every year to help films get made—exhilarating, innovative, independent films like Obvious Child, Beasts of the Southern Wild, and Casting JonBenet.
In order for Rooftop to continue to serve our audience, filmmakers and support the broader cultural community all across New York City, year-round, we need YOU—the members of our community—to support all that we do. So please make a (tax deductible) contribution today!
NO ONE DOES WHAT WE DO 
We at Rooftop strive to create events with meaning. More than a film festival, Rooftop Films screenings are innovative, once-in a lifetime film events. We bring films directly to communities across the city and create unique holistic events tying together the film, venue and live music.
'Beach Rats' @ Coney Art Walls
  'Rat Film' @ The Old American Can Factory
  'Band Aid' @ House of Vans

WHY YOUR SUPPORT MATTERS

Because of you we are able to travel the city to present events on rooftops, in parks, and along waterways and to celebrate film, music, and spectacular locales.
Because of you we are able to support emerging filmmakers and connect them with new audiences across the city.
Because of you we are able to showcase the best new independent films in the world--like Menashe, The Big Sick, The Fits, Cameraperson, Tangerine, The Wolfpack, and many more.
And because of you we all get to explore hidden corners of the city together; from the top of the William Vale Hotel, 25 stories above Brooklyn, to the graffiti covered roof of New Design High School overlooking the Lower East Side.

Venue: St. Bart's Church: 325 Park Ave, New York, NY. 10022
Rooftop strives to make all of our events unique, and this year’s Gala will be as vibrant and inclusive as any of our past events. We will transform St. Bart’s Church on Park Avenue into a boisterous, celebratory, Rooftop-style party that brings together the brightest leaders and lovers of the film community. This year we will be honoring two of the most gifted and fearless filmmakers working in film today: Yance Ford, whose hauntingly intimate documentary Strong Island brought a fresh perspective to conversations about race and violence; and Sean Baker, who has been redefining realism in cinema for years with brilliant films like Starlet, Tangerine, and this year’s breakout, The Florida Project.

The betta fish can bring a difference visual expression of impact. I thing colors and emotions are closely linked. What best represents your personality? 

The Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendens), also known as the betta, is a popular fish in the aquarium trade. Bettas are a member of the gourami family and are known to be highly territorial. Males in particular are prone to high levels of aggression and will attack each other if housed in the same tank. If there is no means of escape, this will usually result in the death of one or both of the fish. Female bettas can also become territorial towards each other if they are placed in too small an aquarium. It is typically not recommended to keep male and female bettas together, except temporarily for breeding purposes which should always be undertaken with caution.

This species is native to the Mekong basin of Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam and is mostly concentrated in the Chao Phraya river in Thailand. The fish can be found in standing waters of canals, rice paddies and floodplains. It is listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN. On 5 February 2019, Thailand's council of ministers confirmed ""Siamese fighting fish"" as Thailand's national aquatic animal.

325,85687915,"I’ve spent a good part of my life working in the religious sphere. More specifically I’ve been trying to help people become better Christians. Yet religion is often part of the problem.
Last year in a small town in the south of Lebanon, my friend Josh and I talked about an idea. It had been brewing for years, but as we talked about it in Lebanon, there seemed to be an urgency to make this idea a reality. The context was fitting; Lebanon is a country where over a dozen religious and political factions have fought a bloody civil war that still to this day hangs like a dark shadow over the people’s daily lives. The impact of religion and conflict leaves a wake in almost every country on earth.
Our idea is to produce a series of short films to tell the stories of victims and peace builders in a variety of global conflicts; to inspire people to look at our own countries and examine how to be people of peace, and to ask the question, 'What is true religion?'
Rabbi Jonathan Sacks said:
‘Religion is like fire and like fire it warms, but it also burns. We are the guardians of the flame.’
Not everyone featured in this film is motivated by a faith. But all of them show a remarkable courage in choosing to value the flame of humanity in the face of indescribable pain and anguish. Those with a religious conviction show that religion is most purely lived out when we choose to “do unto others as we would have them do unto us”. This Golden Rule thinking is embodied by a variety of people in our film who could easily have chosen a life of bitterness and revenge, but instead have chosen to pursue reconciliation and sometimes even forgiveness.
""Guardians of the Flame"" is a series of short films looking at conflicts around the world, beginning with Northern Ireland. ‘The Troubles’ were a tragic 30 year manifestation of violence and sectarian hatred on the streets of Belfast, Derry/Londonderry, the border regions and random small towns and villages all over the north of Ireland. At the time these six counties were a place filled with churches but sadly lacking in enough justice, or any culture of reconciliation. In 1969, Christianity in Northern Ireland did not equal reconciliation or justice.
Often in places of conflict, religion is either an apathetic bystander or, at worst the instigator of religious war. We want to look at the destructive role religion, and tribal Christianity in particular, has played in excluding others, building walls and fueling the sectarianism in places like Northern Ireland.
We also want to profile the heroes who show us how forgiveness can conquer hate, how true religion welcomes the marginalised, builds bridges and breaks down walls of isolation.

About Us
Jonny Clark has over 20 years of experience in peacebuilding and reconciliation through Christian based ministries, including places such as Israel/Palestine, Burundi and Rwanda. Born in New Zealand, Jonny moved to Northern Ireland at a young age. He has since been based predominantly in Northern Ireland; working with Protestant and Catholic communities in Belfast, as well as running a peacebuilding and reconciliation school through YWAM (Youth With A Mission), offering scholarships to receive students from other nations that have experienced conflict. This in turn has resulted in establishing and sending out other Christian based peacebuilding teams to places such as Lebanon, Israel/Palestine, Bosnia and South Africa. Jonny has a wealth of experience from a variety of different contexts when it comes to conflict and peacemaking. He is passionate about a Christian theology that is underpinned by peace and reconciliation, and his knowledge on the topic has led him to speak and teach all over the world.
Josh Eaves helped to establish 'The Foundation for Forgiveness and Reconciliation' in Lebanon, an organisation that equips the emerging generation in Lebanon with skills of peacemaking and nonviolent conflict resolution. Following this he recently completed his MA in Peacebuilding and Reconciliation, which included a research project for an international relief and development organisation on the role of ecumenism in peacebuilding. Having come from a creative background, Josh is also a producer at Global Fire Creative (see below). From filming on the front lines in Northern Iraq to the slums of Nairobi, Josh's role at Global Fire Creative has given him significant experience in documentary storytelling, with particular regard to humanitarian issues.
In Partnership with Global Fire Creative 
Global Fire Creative is a creative agency based on the south coast of England. They believe in using media for good and are committed to supporting social change through their creative services. Global Fire have produced humanitarian and non-profit films covering topics from street children in the Philippines, to the refugee crisis in Northern Iraq and poverty in the rural villages of Ethiopia. 
Funding
We are seeking funding to contribute to the post-production of the Northern Ireland episode that you can preview above. So far we have funded the pre-production and filming ourselves with Global Fire Creative, however we are now at the point where we are in need of further funding to finish this inital 'pilot' episode. 
£2200 will go towards post production costs including editing, colour grading, purchasing of additional archive footage/imagery and any other graphic or animated elements. 8-10% of the £2200 will cover kickstarter fees. 
£3000 will enable us to go back to Northern Ireland for some extra filming which will benefit the completion of the documentary. 
Anything raised beyond this will allow us to contribute funds towards filming future episodes in other locations. (These locations are still to be confirmed, but could include places such as Lebanon, Bosnia, Burundi, Israel/Palestine etc...) "
326,363115969,"Overview 
Lurnity is a website where you can learn anything by taking a course online, the goal of this website is to help people who don't want to pay a fortune to go to college/university to learn a single subject in the course of anywhere from 1-8 years, when you can learn online from someone who has experience doing that one thing that you want to take a course on, for less than an 8th of the cost you would going to college when you don't really want to.
Let's get down to the questions everyone interested in supporting this project is wondering.
For Course Takers; 
Q: Will courses be made in writing or will there be videos?
A: That depends on the teacher, but we encourage  the teachers to create their course with videos.
Q: Will there be tests on the course to see what we've learned?
A: Yes, we want to implement tests so it helps not only the course takers by reviewing what they have learned but also teachers to see if they're missing any information on their course.
Q: How do we earn Lurnity points?
A: When you take a test on a course you're taking, if you pass, you earn a Lurnity Point. You also earn Lurnity points fully completing a course and using a referral system we plan on implementing.
Q: Do we have to purchase the course again after we've completed it?
A: No! Once you purchase a course, it will be on your account forever. We do this so if you forget something you've learned in that course, down the road you can review that course for free.
Q: If I purchase a course I don't end up wanting anymore, do I get a refund?
A: Yes! You're entitled to a refund as long as you request it within a 24 hour time period of you purchasing it or haven't completed the course.
Q: Will there be 24 hour technical support & a refund department?
A: Yes, we want our users to have the best possible experience. If something goes wrong, you will have access to our 24 hour tech support team, or if you're looking for a refund during after hours, we will have a dedicated department just for your needs!
Q: Will it be free to sign up?
A: Absolutely, all accounts are free to sign up, the only time you ever buy something is if you want to take a course!
For Teachers; 
Q: Who can sign up as a teacher?
A: Anyone, there are no requirements for you to share your knowledge with other people.
Q: Does it cost anything for a teachers account?
A:  No! Teaches accounts are also free, the only thing you have to do is upload a course within 2 weeks of creating your teacher account, otherwise you account may be switched to a course taker account.
Q: Can teachers earn Lurnity points?
A: Yes, just like a course taken, you have to take course, complete it and take a test to earn Lurnity points!
Q: Can I list my course at any price?
A: Yes, there will be a guideline for teachers and course prices when the website launches.
Q: Does Lurnity take any money from me after people purchased my course?
A: Yes, we want to keep the site open forever, so Lurnity will take 5% per purchase of each course. Example; Your course is $50, we will take $2.50 leaving you with $48.50.
We also plan on implementing a certificate system where you will receive a certificate after completing & passing the course you took.
Why Kickstarter?
We asked Kickstarter to help fund this project because to get the Lurnity to be the best, we need all custom work done. Design, course system, affiliate system, test system, chat system an more.
Exit; 
We hope you find this project interesting. We feel that it will help many people out, without the struggle of sitting in a class and spending big bucks on a course you can do online. Learn from home is the way to go!"

La Ville Miraculeuse est un livre qui regroupe dix ans de photographie de rue, la pratique photographique dont je suis tombé amoureux. Dix ans de voyages, de rencontres, d’errances parfois, d’instants volés ou partagés.
Quel que soit l’endroit où mon travail m’emmène, j’ai toujours un appareil sur moi et j’ai toujours un moment pour “aller voir”. Quelle que soit la route que je prenne en photographie, je reviens toujours à la photographie de rue qui est pour moi sa forme la plus simple et naturelle, en même temps qu’un terrain de jeu infini.
Il n'y a rien de plus simple que de marcher, observer et capturer, le plus souvent en noir et blanc. J’ai commencé à sortir de chez moi avec un appareil pour apprendre la photo, et n’ai longtemps pensé qu’en noir et blanc dans les rues parisiennes. Avec les années et les voyages qui s'accumulent, je reviens toujours à ces premières amours : la cité en noir et blanc et ces moments de grâce.
Après 10 années de photographie , je voulais rassembler ces photos et leur donner un sens. N’étant pas journaliste, ces photos ne sont jamais liées à une histoire, un ensemble cohérent. Ce sont des petits bouts de Paris, de New York, de Hong Kong, de Rio ou de Tokyo et d’autres villes que j’ai vues quelques jours ou plusieurs mois.
""A street photographer has no fucking idea what’s going to happen on any given day. We go out on the boulevards of the world, just to be out, and just to be watching the way the world keeps presenting itself with ideas and incidents and moments of consciousness."" 
- Meyerovitz
La Ville Miraculeuse - Paris
Pour mettre ces photos en histoire j'ai toujours pensé à Marie. Aux mots de Marie.
Marie était là quand je me suis passionné pour la photographie, et je crois avoir été là quand elle s'est passionné pour les mots et la prose. Parce que c’était drôle, tragique, magnifique, noir et blanc souvent… Je vois la photographie de rue comme une poésie et je ne connais pas de plus belle poésie que celle de Marie.
Alors naturellement, je lui ai proposé de mettre en mots ces images. Et le résultat est au niveau de mon espérance.
La Ville Miraculeuse - Le Livre
Le livre est écrit, pas encore ponctué mais presque terminé. Pour qu’il existe enfin, nous avons besoin d’en imprimer une petite série.
La maquette, l'impression et le choix du papier sont réfléchis avec Bastien Bouvier, Directeur Artistique, avec qui j’ai déjà eu la chance de travailler auparavant. Son talent et son expérience nous permettront d'obtenir un ouvrage qui corresponde le plus fidèlement possible à notre histoire photographique et littéraire.
Le projet est là, prêt à produire, il ne manque plus que quelques lecteurs, qui seraient prêts à voyager avec nous...

La Ville Miraculeuse, c'est un voyage
Celui qui brouille les repères et gomme les contours des habitudes. C'est la traversée de villes inconnues, différentes, hostiles ou accueillantes, la solitude face à la foule, l'immensité contre l'individu. C'est l'inattendu qui surgit au coeur de ce vacarme incessant, ces lumières qui ne s'éteignent jamais, et dans la foule qui avance à pas lents ou dans l'urgence, soudain, une rencontre, un regard qu'on attrape, des sourires entre deux rames de métro, la chaleur humaine qui s'incarne, homme ou femme, vieillard ou enfant.
La Ville Miraculeuse saisit au vol ce voyageur solitaire qui parcourt le monde. Peut-être qu'il cherche quelque chose ou bien quelqu'un, peu importe, l'important se niche dans ces empreintes qu'il laisse derrière lui, comme autant de photographies.
La Ville Miraculeuse - Sienne
La Ville Miraculeuse, c'est une histoire
Genaro m'a proposé de mettre en mots ce voyage imaginaire, composé à partir de quelques unes de ses séries de photographies de rue, et j'ai imaginé un récit qui soit intemporel et universel, dans une ville qui serait à la fois Paris, Tokyo, Londres ou bien Rio. Si c'est autour de la photographie que nous avons lié notre amitié, ce sont les mots qui l'ont cimentée. Nous partageons le même amour pour eux, leur musique et leur poésie, et pour les projets qui sortent de l'ordinaire. 
La Ville Miraculeuse, c’est une invitation
Le titre s’inspire de ces quelques vers de Paul Nougé, poète belge :
""L'intérieur de votre tête n'est pas cette masse grise et blanche que l'on vous a dite
C'est un paysage de sources et de branches, une maison de feu
Mieux encore
La Ville Miraculeuse qu'il vous plaira d'inventer""
Ce livre que nous voulons faire exister, nous l'imaginons beau, comme un cadeau, unique, comme un objet rare, poétique, comme une parenthèse dans nos vies d’urbains pressés. C’est une invitation au lâcher-prise, à la découverte.
Et si pour une fois, on laissait l’imagination prendre le dessus ?

Marie - Auteure
Marie Lemeland écrit et décrit des émotions, raconte des histoires vraies. Auteure de Bande de Bâtards, projet artistique et de reportage sur les secrets de famille, la sortie de son premier roman n'a jamais été aussi proche.
La meilleure manière de décrire sa poésie est de lui laisser la place :
""Je croise l’ancien et le nouveau monde, allant et venant entre surface et souterrains. La vie grouille en sous-sol, tandis qu’elle semble s’être figée à l’air libre. Le cours des choses en est inversé, je marche à la lisière, laissant venir à moi tous ces univers sans retrouver mon sens de l’orientation. Je pourrais dévier de mon chemin mais après tout, personne ne m’attend.""

You will only be charged if we meet the initial goal of $450. Pledging helps to unlock the other designs so please pledge if a design you like is still locked!
The main goal is the Sailor Narwhal Moon pin. She will be 2"" long with gold plating. The glitter will be on the horn, bow and the silver crystal. The stripes on the collar will be screen printed. All pins will be sent out on backer cards.
The stretch goals are for the rest of the Sailor Narwhal Guardians and Tuxedo Narwhal Mask. As with Sailor Narwhal Moon each Sailor will have a glitter horn and screen printed collar stripes. For Tuxedo Narwhal Mask the glitter will be on his horn and the inside of his cape. Surveys will be sent out at the end of the campaign to each backer for their selection of pin(s).

About a Book is raising $200,000. This will provide for the major update needed to the website to make it interactive with each reader, create an iPhone and Android app and cover marketing costs. The current version of the site allows readers to create a profile favoriting authors and books they have read but it is missing the engine that customizes the site to each reader. 
AboutaBook.net is a website that allows readers to easily find their next book to read. Users will have the ability to create their own profile favoriting authors they love and books they have read. Their customized homepage will show new releases from their favorite authors and series. Other features offered include tailored recommendations based on their favorited authors and books, recommendations from other users whose author list closely matches theirs, a random book selector that will let users try something new within their search parameters and be able to easily view the entire book and series list by author. 
While there are other sites that let you track books you have read and communicate directly with authors and other fans, the simple ability to keep track of authors you love and their new releases is still a very manual process. For authors releasing a new title who don't have a publisher willing to spend large amounts on advertising, getting your next release to your existing fans is challenging. Authors will benefit knowing their fan base can keep track of when their next book is being released and from new fans discovering their booklist.
About a Book is also a platform for authors to connect with readers directly. We can work directly with authors to target readers who already love reading what they write. Advertising inclusive of banner ads, email blasts, social media posts and in our monthly newsletter will connect authors to new and existing fans. 
About a Book will offer two levels of membership. Our free membership will provide limited results on the users' homepage showing a small selection of the new releases from their favorite authors and the ability to keep track of authors they love and books they have read and want to read.
The Premium membership shows all the new and upcoming releases from the users' favorite authors, provides unlimited recommendations based on the user profile & similar readers and allows for customization of favorite book lists. Premium members will enjoy an ad-free experience with enhanced features including a rewards program and access to book club resources and book trivia."
331,214601592,"I have created a photography book to drive awareness and tell the tragic story of the Invisible People of Belarus. This book will provide education and expose secret lives of disabled people and Chernobyl victims locked up in the governmental institutions in Belarus.
The book will be written in two languages; Russian and English. It is important for me that it will be available for viewers who live in post-soviet countries, where issue with disablism is high. ‘Disablism: discriminatory, oppressive or abusive behavior arising from the belief that disabled people are inferior to others.’
The book will combines my photography with writing by Nobel Prize in Literature Winner Svetlana Alexievich, who is an investigative journalist from Belarus. Svetlana knows my project and is happy for me to use her writing.
'Invisible People of Belarus - 30th Anniversary of the Chernobyl Disaster'
The launch of the book will coincide with my first solo show in a late October/early November in London. This exhibition will be a charity event during which money will be raised for organizations helping in Belarusian Internats.
10% of the future proceeds (no Kickstarter funds) from the sale of this book will be donated to an amazing charity ""Chernobyl Children's Trust "" which supports people living in Belarusian Internats. CCT is striving to change the institutional system and advocates for disabilities by supporting families that choose to keep their disabled children at home.
About Me:
I was born in neighboring Poland, a satellite state of USSR at the time of the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. I decided to go to Belarus to document the stories of horrifically neglected and abandoned children, born with mental and physical deficiencies from the aftermath of this tragic accident 30 years ago. During my investigations, what surprised me the most was that it wasn’t just victims of the Chernobyl disaster that were housed in these institutions…
 Invisible People of Belarus
Belarus, located in the far-flung reaches of Eastern Europe is the last dictatorship on the continent and for some is still considered to be part of Russia. This is a place where the president, Alexander Lukashenko is seen as an unchallenged, fearsome and almost ‘God-like’ figure. Belarusians still fear the KGB and their ever-watchful eye. This is very much a place where ‘Soviet’ mentality is still the norm. 
When you walk the streets, one could easily mistake themselves as being on a movie set. Everything is extremely clean and organized, the grass is always clean-cut, and the architecture glitzy and reflecting perfectionism. It does make you wonder exactly what may be ‘hiding’ behind this facade. 
‘Invisible People of Belarus’ is a documentary project about the lives of disabled people and Chernobyl victims locked up in the governmental institutions called ‘Internats’. Internat is in Belarusian: name of the governmental institution that houses disabled people through their entire lives. Place, which is something in between an orphanage, asylum and hospice for people with mental disabilities, Down syndrome, autism, people with physical mutations, deformations, and people with Aids.
Lyosha. This severely autistic boy is very active and inpatient, however in front of a camera he would calm down immediately. He loved the flash light and would pose perfectly still until the light would fire.
The government has created Internats to separate Chernobyl victims and disabled children from other healthier orphans in order to keep them hidden from the society. These are places where tens of thousands of people spend their entire lives. These institutions have become a subject of folklore legends and made a stigma on their residents.
Sveta. The aftermath from Chernobyl has not yet passed is Belarus. Every year children are born with mental and physical deficiencies from the disaster of 1986. People still live in contaminated zones or carry ‘genetic marks’ from the past generation.
In general, disabled people are certainly still something of a taboo in Belarus, and often abandoning, or ‘giving them away’ is easier than being exiled from the local community. Mothers are told that institutions are better places for their disabled kids than home. In the past, mothers would be persuaded to give up their children and place them in the internats, nowadays they are manipulated into abortion.                   
Belarusian people themselves are not aware of what is really going on inside these places. People are not properly looked after, hardly any medical stuff works in the internats. Most of carers are ex-cleaners with no medical training. Internats are partly self-sufficient, where patients are forced to work in fields, clean and cook.
This project aims to indirectly expose the on-going problems with human rights violations; poor health care and free labour, which very often come with lack of money and knowledge.
Free Labor - Disabled women working in a field. Institutions are partly self-sufficient. Patients are forced to work in fields, clean and cook.
Book ‘Invisible People of Belarus’ focuses on disabled people who are physically and/or mentally more independent. 
These photos are a story of those people as human beings; as people who suffer and struggle against injustice everyday life; and as people who look after each other, build long lasting friendships, and even fall in love even within an environment that is far from civilized life. 
Room/cell for dangerous patients who are separated from the rest for security reasons. There has been incident’s when patients have killed another whilst sharing cells.
  Some of the older ‘residents’ are locked in a small room without windows. The tiny vision panel in the door is all they have
  Room with multiple rows of beds. Couples have no privacy, residents are divided by sex and sleep in different rooms.
These invisible people stay invisible. There may be nobody to remember them after all, and a picture might be the only proof of their existence. 
    I believe, to successfully improve the situation of the Belarusian internats, first we must change the mentality of the Belarusians. It’s in their hands to change the future of the people locked up. However, there is no free press in Belarus, that’s why, I decided to work on this project and share it with Belarusian people and the rest of the World.                                                 

What is more, the aftermath of Chernobyl and the issues with nuclear disasters are an on going problems around the world… We cannot forget about the victims of radiation and new victims born nowadays because of the modified gene their parents carried on.


'We’re often silent. We don’t yell and we don’t complain. We’re patient, as always. Because we don’t have the words yet. We’re afraid to talk about it. We don’t know how. It’s not an ordinary experience, and the questions it raises are not ordinary. The world has been split in two: there’s us, the Chernobylites, and then there’s you, the others. Have you noticed? No one here points out that they’re Russian or Belarussian or Ukrainian. We all call ourselves Chernobylites. “We’re from Chernobyl.” “I’m a Chernobylite.” As if this is a separate people. A new nation. '
                                                  'Voices from Chernobyl' Svetala Alexievich

333,1085982572,"Cosmic Surgery is a photography project by Alma Haser in which the faces of the subjects she photographs are transformed into something unrecognisable. This book documents the results.
Cosmic Surgery started back in 2011 when Alma would construct origami shapes to attach to her own face, hiding or disguising her identity in a series of self-portraits. Friends and other willing participants eventually became the subjects, having intricate origami structures made from their faces. Each portrait is printed, sometimes numerous times, and folded into complicated origami shapes that are then placed over their original face. The combined assembly is then re-photographed creating unsettling results.
Last year a very limited run of 10 books were produced by hand. This Kickstarter is to help make the second edition happen.
A spread from the first edition
PLAY

 THE BOOK
In the process of producing the first limited edition pop-up book, science writer Piers Bizony and designer Emily Macaulay joined the Cosmic Surgery team to help introduce a narrative background, layout and unique construction. This second edition wants to expand on those ideas. It will be a photo book set in a fictional, not too distant future, at a point where “intelligent materials” are just about to transform the world of cosmetic surgery.
The book will have a hardcover printed and foil embossed. It will be 190x240mm (slightly smaller than A4) and contain 48 pages filled with the original portraits and a few new ones that haven’t been displayed before. There will also be a number of smaller booklets inside, containing the written content. And finally the book will include a pop-up portrait and a folded one which will be attached in the UK by our trusted team of pop-up makers, meaning this book has all the care and attention to detail that went in to first 10. We will be limiting this edition to 500 copies.

WHO IS INVOLVED?
Alma Haser – The creator and Photographer of Cosmic Surgery.
Emily Macaulay (Stanley James Press) – The designer of the book. She has worked alongside Alma to get this project off the ground and has been involved ever since Alma asked her if she was interested in helping her create a unique photography pop-up book.
Piers Bizony – A famous science writer and the person who gave this photography series a story. Without his imagination and experience in science writing it would not have been the same. 
And of course all the beautiful 'patients' that have allowed themselves to be photographed and have their faces folded into unrecognisable new ones.
Alma hard at work finishing off the last of the Cosmic Surgery Portraits.
'Patient no. 16' Print
HOW WILL THE FUNDS BE USED?
Making a book doesn't have to cost £20,000.
When the 1st edition was released our main goal was to release a pop-up photo book that didn’t cost the earth. All the advice we were given in those early days was to ship the designs off to China where a book could be made inexpensively and in massive runs. Pop-up books are still made by hand, each pop-up stuck in by someone's hands. We decided early on that we wouldn’t be able to guarantee good working conditions for all the people involved if we sent the work halfway round the world.
So all in all this is not a cheap book to make. The funding will cover the printing and binding of the book here in the EU, we haven’t chosen the cheapest printers, we’ve chosen someone we can trust. It also covers the cost of our trusted pop-up team back in the UK who will attach the pop-up sections before packaging them and sending them on their way to all you lovely backers.
And finally it also includes some money for the people involved in the design, the story and making these books happen along the way.
Postcard Pack
Using magazines with the 'Fold your face' instruction pack
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO MAKE A BOOK?
The book design is almost finished, we are just finalising the tiny details. The book will be ready to print as the Kickstarter ends. We are currently talking to two printers based in Europe and haven’t made up our mind which one to use yet, one is based in Belgium, the other in Germany.
If this Kickstarter campaign is successful then sometime in late April we should be making a trip to see the printers just as the first pages come off the press. The finished books will then be shipped to us sometime in mid June, where our pop-up team will fold and stick 500 pop-ups into 500 books, which is definitely not going to be easy! So if you have pledged you can expect to receive a beautiful, hand finished book by early to mid July.
Whilst we wait for the printers to do their thing we will also have time to work our way through the other rewards, running workshops, taking original origami portraits and posting postcards and prints to their lucky recipients.

Okay, guys. Here's the skinny (fat). The Heist is our sophomore effort.  We have managed to pull together a slew of new material in this time, and we've decided the best way to release it was through a series of themed EPs. This would be the first. We have 6 spanking new songs that we want to shove down your throats in the nicest way possible. 
We're big into that noir stuff. We also like circus sideshows and cabaret. We wanted to explore this ""burlesque"" sound and molest it with loud rock music. We're good at molesting things with loud rock music. That aside, we want The Heist to sound huge, glamorous, and silly. And we've put LOTS and LOTS and LOTS of time and effort into these songs in the studio. If you've seen us live, you KNOW theatricality is our thing... So for The Heist release show/party, we wanted nothing less than a complete sideshow production; not just a concert, but a Burlesque Variety show, that would feature not just bands, but also fire dancers, belly dancers, regular dancers, boxing, striptease, ventriloquism, poetry, art/graffiti, comedians, etc. Essentially, artists of all trades... So that, and we wanted to have this filmed to capture a completely unique experience that isn't too common anymore.
Sounds pretty sick, right? But we can only pull this off if we make our goal... What you're donating to isn't just your pre-order of our new EP, but also mastering, pressing, merchandise, and the ability to make this grandiose Burlesque event happen! "

Our long term goal for the project is to have it made into a feature length film. The script has already been written by Michael Coulombe and we are now ready to move towards pre-production, with the intention of beginning principal photography the week of April 25th.

Initially thinking they got away with the crime, they soon find out something else awaits them when they arrive at the cabin as they become convinced that the punishment does not always fit the crime.

We are a small new company (name still pending) that has an incredibly fun new idea for a puzzle game app, ChromaRaze.
Our game is a new take on a Rubik's puzzle right on your phone or tablet. The game promises to be both fun and challenging. The game's premise is a very simple one, much like a Rubik's cube, but achieving this goal will take some brain power.
We tried to develop the app ourselves, however, we have jobs outside of this project so we cannot dedicate the man power to develop it ourselves. However, we have identified a development company with a proven track record of making quality games that we will be partnering up to build our game.
The majority of the money that we are asking for is for the development cost of the app. The remainder will be used to file patents for the game to make sure that our idea is protected while the app is in development. 
Our goal is to have the game out sometime by Fall 2015/Winter 2016, if not earlier.
Help us make this game become reality. We promise a fun experience once the game is complete that you will not want to put it down."

To this end, the Atlanta Gift Show in July looks the most promising this year to find distributors; it costs $3,000 for the booth and of course there's the cost of getting and staying there from July 15-19th.

Thank you for stopping by on our project page, we hope it catches your imagination.
In a nutshell, we're looking for your pledges of support to help print this unique calendar here in Ireland.  In return you will receive fantastic rewards.
I will tell you all about the calendar in a moment or two.  But first here is a little bit about my Kite photography, it's the coolest thing you may never have  known!
So how does this photography from a Kite work?  Like all the best ideas it's quite simple really but can be quite hard to explain but I'll give it a go. I fly the Kite up about 30 feet/10M, then attach a cradle containing my camera to the Kite line.  The Kite is flown higher lifting the camera and cradle further into the air.  While flying the Kite I operate the camera and cradle by remote control.  With 360 degrees pan and a tilt of 180 degrees there's full control of what is to be photographed.  Some might call it multitasking, I call it being happily busy.  If this still seems a bit confusing here's a little movie my children made to explain it better......

Hope that helped, we had such fun making it.  In the real world there's a bit more technology at play in my photography.  Here's the camera and cradle attached to the Kite line and ready for take off.  But where's the Kite?........

Doing my thing at the Cliffs of Moher
Keeping the fun in what we do
OK, so far so good.  I fly a Kite, it lifts a camera and I'm hoping I have given you a better understanding of this fine art.  But what is the outcome of my style of photography?  Well, it is photography, so it's going to be all about the image no matter how cool the process.......
Open air gallery
As much as I love doing what I do, and I do, it is all about the image!    Over the last ten years I've been flying ridiculously expensive cameras to capture images of Ireland that really speak for themselves.  Many thousands of miles nave been travelled around Ireland in the pursuit of a good breeze and some decent light........

Usually at very short notice and in reaction to our wonderfully unpredictable weather I'm off,(thank you Bryony and boys)at all hours and only on the promise of a bit of Kite flying somewhere in Ireland. If you're not there you will miss it.....
Sunrise at Fanad Head Donegal with a little help from my Kite
After 10 amazing years flying Kites in Ireland I am ready to share with you some of the fruits of that unique experience.  I'ts so exciting to be able to offer an affordable, accessible piece of Irish art that will keep on giving for a whole year and longer........
Here's a couple of images to wet your appetite.
Over the first few months the calendar will take you on a journey along the breadth of the now world famous Causeway Coast(thanks to Lonely Planet).
Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge Antrim
Then spend the rest of your 2018 along the length of the Wild Atlantic Way There will be lighthouses, seascapes, history, beauty and a surprise or two for good measure. This is a year long journey that will bring back great memories or have you planning your next trip.

I offer you Ireland's Coast from a Kite 2018 Calendar.            
All the images have been taken, the design is done and the printers are ready to get the press rolling.  It's all down to you now.  
So what will the calendar look like?  It's a wall calendar  and is landscape orientated, A4 (12 x 8) in size when closed and A3 (12 x 16) when open.  There will be an A4 photograph for each month with location name and county or Island name.  A full A4 sized dater page beneath with room to write notes for each day. Practical as well as beautiful.  On successful completion of our campaign the calendars will be immediately printed and will be shipped anywhere in the world.  Our calendar will make a perfect gift for you or for anyone you know who has a love of Ireland.
Here's our 2017 Fermanagh from a Kite Calendar that sold out!
Covering a small geographic and population area our 2017 Fermanagh calendar sold out and was posted/shipped worldwide in November 2016. The even more successful 2018 Fermanagh calendar will be back from our local printer in a few days ready to post/ship worldwide again.  
We've got the experience to deliver for you too!

Here's how it will all happen.  Our funding campaign will run for two weeks only. With your pledges of support and the successful completion of our campaign the calendar will go off to the printers straight away.  The printers will turn them around in one week, then I'll go and collect them myself.  It's all part of the beauty of using a local printer.  
Give us a day or two to full-fill your rewards and then, they'll be on their way to new homes all over the world.  We will be using air-mail so the calendars will be arriving with you 5-7 days later.  For those further flung places it may take up to 10 days.  Everyone will have their calendars by the first week of December if not sooner.  Making good time as a wonderfully unique Irish gift for you, family and friends this Christmas/Holidays.    
Thank you so much for getting this far and we look forward to your pledges of support for some totally awesome rewards.  Don't forget to share our calendar on social media.  We would love to get it out to as wide an audience as possible.  With your pledges you will not only get a wonderful calendar but will also be supporting a wholly original Irish project and be part of a first for Irish photography.
Even if you are, or are not supporting our project we would really love you to share it here and on your social media.

     Los Coulters have recorded an instrumental MEGAMAN 6 tribute album and need help raising funds for publication and distribution.  The album's recording and artwork has already been finished and we simply need funds for printing, packaging and shipping. We are eager to share this music with our fans, but we need your help. So please share this project with friends!

Who are Los Coulters?
     Drummer Mark and saxophonist/keyboardist John grew up in Kansas City.  The brothers have eclectic interests ranging from 50's mambos, 70's salsas, and videogame music.  Artist Anna Frischknecht designs all of the bands album covers, posters and web promotions to give the group a unique style.

About the Megaman 6 Tribute Album
       We've recorded instrumental jazz versions of the eight main levels and the boss battle from NES game Megaman 6.  Yuko Takehara designed the game's original soundtrack on midi synthesizers with each level having it's own theme.  Each song is reflective of the original stage's environment. Plantman is tropical and Yamatoman features a Japanese-style war song. It's fun taking a song composed on one instrument and playing it on another.
       There are many Megaman remixes out there but very few instrumental albums dedicated to a single game.  These types of special projects need funding to receive attention and be enjoyed by fans.

Help us through Kickstarter
      Kickstarter is a great website to fund creative projects such as this.  We are accepting funds for this project until, October 31st Halloween. Any packages that have been pledged for should be delivered by December. 
        The money raised will go toward printing and packaging the phyical ablums, shirts, posters and the shipping of these rewards.

YOU CHOOSE THE NEXT SONG!
        Any money pledged allows you the chance to vote for the next song Los Coulters records from the Megaman or Megaman X series. The song voted for the most by pledgers will be released as a digital single online for FREE. 
       You can help bring this project to life and please make sure you look at other projects you can contribute to on the Kickstarter website.  Even if you can't contribute to this album please share it with friends who might be interested on facebook, or twitter.

Waveform Network Group
Started as a student group for St. Clair College's Computer Systems Technology programs 3rd year Technical Project, Waveform's path is quickly growing. Currently Waveform is finishing up the Technical project with Kelcom Mobility Solutions (1969) in Windsor ON. 
 After graduation Waveform plans on working with small business around Windsor Ontario as well as home users. Waveform Network Group will follow the Network Design Process, evaluate the user and business needs, evaluate the current network architecture, and make recommendations to make computer system networks more efficient and ultimately save our clients money on their Total Cost of Ownership. 
Waveform Network Group will soon be establishing a supplier relationship with a hardware supplier in London, Ontario, and with the help of a close-knit group of contracted installers and electrical technicians, Waveform can bring its network design recommendations into reality.
Waveform Network Group would like to partner with the Windsor Youth Centre, and with the help of Paul Christopher, create a non-profit organization that would teach kids the basics of electrical engineering, soldering, circuits, logic gates, desktop/laptop computer hardware, and even entrepreneurship. These kids would then have a chance to be employed as an installer or technician at Waveform Network Group, who would in turn donate its resources to the Windsor Youth Centre.

345,815531268,"We plan to travel through every country in Latin America and make quality recordings of all the music we find there.This includes street music, indigenous music, big bands - everything.We will talk to people in every town and city and village and find and record all the musicians we can.We will take note of what it is they played, either original or cover and try to find out where it comes from.It will be recorded by 2 sets of high quality stereo condenser microphones and mastered at the end of the journey.
From Argentinian folk lore, to Brazilian samba, to indigenous tribal songs;every country and every province has it’s own style and history and we want to make a huge anthology of it all.To create something that will capture forever the music of the Americas at this point in time.We hope it will be studied and used in universities around the world, we hope that it will contain something never before heard by mass ears.
There may be some ticket expenses, but mostly we will be hitch hiking from village to village and talking to the locals and finding where the musicians are.We will also be making a film of this journey and we plan to spend over a year in total with this journey.We will also be playing music ourselves and will receive a small income from that, but our main mission is to create this anthology.Create something that will enrich the world culturally and show the vast diversity and brilliance of all the music of the Americas.
We need your help to get us started!First we need some equipment.We won’t be buying expensive equipment as it might attract the thieves, just an audio recorder with 4 condesnor microphones can record anything.We will also need a camera, and a computer to edit.As well as living and travelling expenses we think we can do this for 10.000!We realise that losing the data could be disastrous, so at the end of each day we will upload what we have to a secure cloud server.And make sure we have spares of the equipment we use.
When we have all the music recorded, then comes the hard part - Getting any copyright clearences, logging it, mastering it and lots of organizing and sorting through it all.In terms of final distribution.We will first offer it to the many world music record labels around the world who have already shown interest and support to this project.We feel that this music should be out there for all to hear and appreciate and to learn from.We want to record it and offer it to the world in the hope it inspires and enriches the culture of world music.
I am a producer by trade, I have recorded over 50 albums in the last ten years and worked at the BBC as technical manager for the much loved Popular Music Show with Roger Hill.I have always had a great ear for recording music and finding musicians. My wife is a violinist from Argentina, and together we make very beautiful music.We have recorded 3 albums so far and you can hear them at www.deadseacaravan.com
I have written a books worth of material on my travelling blog about busking around Europe.I am the top result on google for busking in Amsterdam and my blog is going viral with 25000 hits so far.You can read all about my past adventures at www.thedeadseacaptain.comMy whole life is music, and if you could help us with this next adventure; you will be helping create something that will live forever and be a strong study of the music of the Americas."

Now, it’s Donna’s turn to reveal the KILLER WITHIN!
""How much do you want to spend?""
Hi, everyone. This is Martin Renner, writer/director of ""BUZZ KILL,"" a horror-comedy being filmed in New Zealand about a KILLER BEE KEEPER. I've been a huge Donna Wilkes fan since the days of ""HELLO LARRY"" and her appearances of T.V. shows such as ""THE INCREDIBLE HULK,"" ""FATHER MURPHY"" and ""T.J. HOOKER.""   
After meeting Donna two years ago, I was inspired to write a key role for her in the hope that she could appear in my movie. Without spoiling too much, it’s a funny, crazy, scene-chewing role that will give Donna the opportunity to play a full-on VILLAIN for the first time!
As it's a modestly-budgeted feature, however, it has so far been difficult to include Donna (to misquote a certain theme song, ""Oakland is a long way from N.Z."").
Then it occurred to me: if a significant percentage of Donna’s loyal fans pledged the price of a cup or two of coffee, the funds could be raised in no time! Basically, it's a win-win-win situation. Donna's fans get to see her in a new movie, I get to include Donna in my film, and Donna gets to have a STAB at the kind of role that Anthony Perkins and Betsy Palmer are still remembered for!
So, how about it? Let's send Donna to New Zealand, aka ""Middle Earth,"" so she can reveal her DARK SIDE!

Andrés de Jerez con la guitarra de Samuelito
(Français)
En 2014, Andrés de Jerez et Samuelito se rencontrent au festival Arte Flamenco de Mont-de-Marsan, qui marque le début d'une belle amitié ponctuée de collaborations artistiques. De cette rencontre, un projet commun est né, faire un disque de flamenco puro, celui de l'émotion comme le cante d'Andrés, celui de la fraîcheur comme le toque de Samuelito.
Andrés de Jerez est un artiste d'intuition, patient, qui sait que chaque chose arrive en son temps, ""sin prisa, pero sin pausa"". Ce disque murit depuis très longtemps. Un rêve qu'il s'est forgé depuis ses 5 ans quand il chantait dans ses premiers tabancos, grâce à son grand-père qui a toujours cru en lui. Une vie de cante jondo jusqu'à l'extrême, d'expériences et de rencontres avec les plus grands.
Samuelito, l'enfant de 5 ans passionné par le flamenco de Manuel Agujetas que lui fait écouter son père, rêve déjà de guitare et s'imagine un jour accompagner le cante puro. Après des années d'études musicales, d'expériences artistiques variées, de rencontres flamencas, et avec la ténacité de vivre son art en accord avec ses convictions, il réalise son désir : un disque de flamenco puro.
Ce disque est bien plus qu'une performance musicale, c'est un aboutissement artistique et singulier.
Grâce à Jean-Louis Solans notre réalisateur, nous avons pu enregistrer dans les mythiques studios Ferber à Paris. L'acoustique est parfaitement adaptée au cante viscéral d'Andrés, au metal de sa voix, et au toque passionné de Samuelito. Nous étions accompagnés de trois palmeros, Isidoro de Jerez, Juan Manuel Cortes et Dani Barba, mais aussi de nos amis qui sont venus pour nous inspirer, nous soutenir, nous encourager.
Tout le long de l'enregistrement, les palos se sont enchaînés : soleá, siguiriya, corridos a capella, tientos.... un vrai répertoire de flamenco puro por derecho, qui, à travers le cante d'Andrés de Jerez, prennent une dimension émotionnelle forte.
Notre distributeur, Buda Musique, permettra le mastering, la fabrication du disque et sa diffusion en France et au niveau international. C'est avec eux que nous travaillerons la promotion.
Nous aurons l'honneur d'avoir les clichés de Miguel Angel Gonzalez, artiste photographe de Jerez, qui nous offrira tout le support visuel du disque. C'est pour Andrés un appui absolu, la consécration d'une longue et puissante amité.
La littérature du disque sera confiée à notre grand ami commun, Michel Mompontet, journaliste aficionado à la plume remarquable.
Ce disque ne serait rien sans vous, car la musique se doit d'être vivante à travers sa transmission. Sans vous, nous ne pourrons pas aller au bout de ce rêve, ni pouvoir le partager.
Nous avons besoin de vous, de votre appui financier, quel qu'il soit. Vous aurez en retour une rétribution qui compensera votre participation
Les différents frais que nous avons à couvrir :
Location du studio A de Ferber
Prise de son et mixage de Jean-Louis Solans
Photos et vidéos de FlamencoPhil
Frais de déplacement, de restauration...
Un budget communication (attaché de presse, clip, photos...) si nous dépassons l'objectif !
Pour que vive le cante jondo, pour que la transmission perdure, pour vous, pour nous, pour les générations à venir.
Merci par avance, nous vous sommes reconnaissants.

En el año 2014, Andres de Jerez y Samuelito se conocen por primera vez en el festival de Mont de Marsan. Es el principio de una bella amistad, punteada de colaboraciones artísticas. De este encuentro, nació un proyecto común : grabar un disco flamenco puro, con la emoción del cante de Andres, y la joventud del toque de Samuelito.
Andrés de Jerez tiene 52 años, es un artista de intuición, paciente, que sabe que cada cosa llega en su tiempo, ""sin prisa, pero sin pausa "". Este disco ha madurado desde hace mucho tiempo. Un sueño que tiene desde sus 5 años cuando cantaba en sus primeros tabancos, gracias a su abuelo que siempre creyó en él. Una vida de cante puro hasta el extremo, llena de existencia y encuentros con los más grandes.
Samuelito tiene 24 años. Desde sus 3 años fue apasionado por el flamenco de Manuel Agujetas cuando su padre lo inicio. Ya soñaba con guitarra y se imagina un día acompañar el cante puro. Después de bastante años de estudios musicales, de varias experiencias artísticas e encuentros flamencos, siempre con el deseo de vivir su arte en acuerdo con sus convicciones, realiza su sueño : un disco flamenco puro.
Este disco es mucho más que una realización musical, es un resultado artístico y singular.
Gracias a Jean-Louis Solans nuestro realizador, pudimos grabar en los míticos Studios Ferber en París. La acústica es perfectamente adaptada al cante visceral de Andrés, al metal de su voz y al toque apasionado de Samuelito. Fuimos acompañados por tres palmeros, Isidoro de Jerez, Juan Manuel Cortes y Dani Barba, pero también por nuestros amigos que asistieron para inspirarnos, sostenernos e animarnos.
Todo lo largo de la grabacion, los palos se encadenaron: soleá, siguiriya, corridos a capella, tientos... un autentico repertorio de flamenco puro por derecho, cual, a través del cante de Andrés de Jerez, toma una dimensión emocional poderosa.
Nuestro distribuidor, Buda Musique, permitirá el mastering, la fabricación del disco y su difusión en Francia y al nivel internacional. Con ellos tambien trabajaremos la promoción.
Tendremos el honor de beneficiar de las fotos de Miguel Angel Gonzalez, artista fotógrafo de Jerez, que nos ofrecerá todo el soporte visual del disco. Es para Andrés un apoyo absoluto, la consagración de una larga y poderosa amistad.
La literatura del disco será confiada a nuestro grande amigo comun, Michel Mompontet, periodista aficionado, a la pluma admirable.
Este disco no sería nada sin ustedes, porque la música tiene que ser viva a través de su transmisión. Sin ustedes, no podremos ir al cabo de este sueño, ni poder compartirlo.
Os necesitamos en su apoyo financiero, cualquiera que sea. Tendrán a cambio una retribución cual compensará su participación.
Los diferentes gastos que tenemos que cubrir:
 Alquiler del estudio A en Ferber
Grabación y mezcla de sonidos de Jean-Louis Solans
Fotos y vídeos de FlamencoPhil
Gastos de desplazamientos, de restauración...
¡ Un presupuesto comunicación (agente de prensa, clip video, fotos) si sobrepasamos el objetivo!
Para que viva el cante jondo, para que la transmisión perdure, para ustedes, para nosotros, para las generaciones futuras.
Gracias de antemano, les estamos muy agradecidos.

Andrés de Jerez and Samuelito first met in 2014 at Mont-de-Marsan's Arte Flamenco festival and their beautiful friendship lead them to create music together eversince. Indeed, a project arised from their meeting : recording a flamenco puro album, which combines the emotion of Andrés' cante (flamenco singing) and Samuelito's fresh toque (flamenco playing).
Andrés de Jerez is a patient artist, always following his intuition when creating music, he knows that everything comes when it's meant to be : ""sin prisa, pero sin pausa"". This album has been blooming for quite some time, a dream that appeared to 5-years-old Andrés while singing in his first tabancos, thanks to his grand-father who never ceased to believe in him. A life of cante jondo (deep flamenco singing) pushed to the extreme, full of experiences and encounters with the most famous artists.
Samuelito, already passioned by flamenco music at the age of 5 listening to his dad's albums of Manuel Agujetas, dreams himself into a guitarist who can accompany cante puro. After years of musical studies, diverse artistic experiences, meetings with the flamenco culture and the desire to live his art in line with his convictions, he finally gets to achieve his goal : a flamenco puro album.
This album is more than a musical performance, it's an artistic and singular accomplishment.
Thanks to Jean-Louis Solans, our director, we had the opportunity to record in the well-known Ferber studios in Paris. The acoustics are completely in accordance with Andrés' deep cante, the metal of his voice, and Samuelito's passionate toque. We were accompanied by three palmeros, Isidoro de Jerez, Juan Manuel Cortes et Dani Barba, but also friends who came to inspire and support us.
Palos succeeded one another all along the recording : soleá, siguiriya, corridos a capella, tientos.... a true flamenco puro por derecho music repertoire, which, through Andrés' cante, lead to a realm strongly charged with emotion.
Our distributor, Buda Musique, will do the mastering, the production of the album and its dissemination in France and at the international scale.
We will have the great opportunity to have Miguel Angel Gonzalez, a photographer from Jerez, making the visual of the album. He's a great support for Andrés, his participation is a good proof of their powerful and long-time friendship.
The litterature of the album is Michel Mompontet's work, a common and great friend. He's a journalist with a dilightful writing style.
This album would be nothing without you, music is something that must be lived and passed on. We can't make this dream come true or spread it without you.
We need you and your financial support no matter how small it is. You will have a reward in return which will make up for your contribution.
We have to cover differents fees :
Rental of Ferber's studios
Work of sound recording and mix by Jean-Louis Solans
Photos and videos by FlamencoPhil
Travel expenses, alimentation...
Communication budget ( video clip, photos, press officer) if we overachieve the goal !
For the cante jondo to live, for the spreading to last, for you, for us, for generations to come.
Thank you in advance, we are very grateful."

355,1312395122,"Lady Vampire is an illustrated version of the classic vampire tale, Carmilla by Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu. Often sited as the first vampire literature and an influence on Bram Stoker's Dracula.
 The stunning model and art muse for this book is the incredible Deborah Anderson! Without her this book and art would not have happened. She is an inspiration greater than my words can express.
    Sometimes after an hour of apathy, my strange and beautiful companion would take my hand and hold it with a fond pressure, renewed again and again; blushing softly, gazing in my face with languid and burning eyes, and breathing so fast that her dress rose and fell with the tumultuous respiration. It was like the ardour of a lover; it embarrassed me; it was hateful and yet overpowering; and with gloating eyes she drew me to her, and her hot lips travelled along my cheek in kisses; and she would whisper, almost in sobs, ""You are mine, you shall be mine, and you and I are one for ever"". (Carmilla, Chapter 4).

I'm Fran, an artist from London. I'm a big D&D and comics nerd who likes old gothic novels, tea and dogs. Thank you very much for checking out my book. Strap in, make yourself a cuppa, and here we go!

Well, wow. I am blown away. You have funded Drowgust 2020 in less than a day! Thank you all so much!
So that means... stretch goals.
Look how many stretchgoals you have unlocked! Moonrat is impressed.
We've unlocked 4 extra pages in the book, featuring some dark elf lore, monsters and artefacts.
Everyone from adventurer up will get an extra vinyl sticker (1 at random for adventurers, 6 in total for treasure hunters and above), a holo foil sticker and a bookmark.
Everyone from cyberpunk up gets more outfits for the printable Moonrat doll.
We have also now unlocked custom tissue paper to wrap rewards in! This not only means your rewards will look extra swanky, but it also helps me improve my own shop and makes me feel more professional at the art stuffs and things.
Finally, if we somehow manage to double the original goal, at £1400 I will draw a brand new comic all about one of the dark elf characters, which backers will get to download for free. (This would be available later than the rest of the rewards as I haven't drawn it yet.)
Dark elves, also known as drow, dunmer or dökkálfar. They're my favourite fantasy race, plus they're fun to draw. My first ever D&D character was a dark elf. Some people think they're evil, but I just think they're neat!
My first D&D character Cillian as a kid, not at all worried about the horror I would put him through when he grew up with my dice rolls
I've always loved fantasy books and comics like Elfquest and Drowtales. I love fairy folklore and the art of Brian Froud. Recently I have become obsessed- ahem interested in the TTRPG Spire and its sister game Heart, where you play drow revolutionaries fighting to rid their city of the evil high elves.
It's pretty trippy. There are magic bees.
Three years ago I came up with a drawing challenge I called Drowgust, because I also love puns*. Each day of August I draw a different dark elf, which I post online. I've been selling the collected Drowgust books online since we don't get to go to as many comic conventions these days. This year, I decided to try Kickstarting my 2020 Drowgust book, and here we are.

*It's like Drawgust, see, only instead of drawing, you're drow-ing, geddit? Eh? Hello?

The cover
A digital mockup of the book (courtesy of covervault)
The Drowgust 2020 book will be 44 pages , A5, full colour throughout. The cover is designed by my very talented friend and fellow D&D nerd Tara of Tara Roseblade Designs.

Each page features a different dark elf, a mixture of my own OCs, fan art and new characters made just for this, including all of the Heart classes and the four new Pathfinder 2e classes:
Captain Phasmara, drow swashbuckler, one of the advanced Pathfinder 2e classes
Essek Thelyss aka the hot boi from Critical Role
I mostly draw in greyscale, but to keep the spots of colour I've added, we're going full colour baby! This is no film noir; this is the future. *puts on rainbow sunglasses*
As well as all of these, which you can see on my Instagram, I'll be adding some book-exclusive characters and sketches.
If you are a fan of the Elder Scrolls, Critical Role, Shadowrun, Spire, or if you love spookycute elves as much as I do, this book is for you!
First of all we've got digital rewards (for if you are more of a cyberpunk). As well as the PDF of Drowgust 2020, I've made a print-and-colour dress up doll of Moonrat, my D&D artificer.
The assembled prototype (not final art)
There's also BUILD-A-DROW!
Throughout August, my twitter followers voted in daily polls to create Arponica the urban witch and their heron familiar, Nightshade.
Formed from the ether by twitter folowers
We’ll be doing this again, building a brand new character that will appear in the Drowgust 2020 book, and backers of any level can get involved! Throughout the campaign there will be polls only available via backer updates. Will our new dark elf be a cyberpunk street samurai, a high fantasy wizard, or maybe just a slice-of-life art student? Only Kickstarter backers, all from explorer up, can decide!

At the adventurer level you will get all of the digital rewards, plus the physical book. You want more than a book? Don't you worry, there's other shiny treasures for you on this quest if you're a treasure hunter!
There's vinyl stickers:
More like stickelfs, amiright? Hello? Anyone?

And a sweet digitally shaded A4 print of Arponica the urban witch:
The print (not final art: it'll be in lovely full colour!)
If you get in promptly you can back at one of the early bird levels and get a limited edition, Kickstarter exclusive bookplate with an inked doodle of one of the drowgust characters of your choice.
An example of the bookplate (not final art; it'ill be all sorts of fancy) featuring a doodle of Gretsch
And finally those of you who like a bit of original art, you can pledge for either a bust or a full body commission at the sorcerer level. I will draw your RPG character, or if you prefer one of the drowgust characters. (No extreme gore or NSFW though.)
  So how much do you have to pledge to get these rewards? Well here's a nice breakdown of the different tiers:
What you get at the different pledge levels, with stretch goals. Early birds are now gone!

I've kept shipping simple:
UK: £2
European Union: £4
Everywhere else: £6
For most pledge levels I will be posting 1st class, except for commission levels which I will send tracked for no extra cost.
Remember to support your postal service! They are doing their best.

delicious and informative
Here is a fancy breakdown of where your money is going. It is shaped like a cheesewheel. I tried to think of some elven fantasy thing it looks more like, but that's the best I could come up with. Anyway, it has some nice numbers in it. Enjoy.

I am aiming for rewards to be delivered to backers between December and January. I can’t guarantee delivery before Christmas.

What is the impact on the next generation after the family’s eldest son survives an AK-47 round to the head? Their life suddenly centered in the Middle East draw the only daughter to Iraq where she ironically falls in love and marries. This film explores the unexpected impact of the tragic invasion of Iraq through the lens of the family’s second son, revealing the very personal effect of skewed politics and policies on one American family. My name is Estes Chastain. In 2005 my father, Kenneth at the age of 51, and older brother K.C., took construction contract jobs in Iraq. They departed with HAZMAT suits and not even as much as a pocket knife to Iraqi “hot zones” at the time the most dangerous places on the globe. My 21 year old sister, Rose, the spoiled, over-protected baby of the family, stunned everyone in 2008 with her plan to board a military transport as a civilian contractor too “to have an adventure.” Suddenly half the family was in the Middle East. Over the course of five years, these family members would have life altering experiences that would consequently alter our lives permanently. This film highlights the succession of events which resulted in wealth, joy, pain, and immeasurable loss. K.C. worked alongside American and Iraqi troops and workers on a forward operating base as a labor foreman. Soon he is an accident investigator and sees many gruesome war related injuries. After three years there he is shot in head. The trajectory was incredibly lucky and KC survives. His abrupt exit for the states results in divorce, home foreclosure, heavy drinking and unemployment. He struggles depression and PTSD. Kenneth often worked in deadly toxic burn pits on base. He returned home after five years in Iraq literally sick and tired. He soon learned he had an aggressive, advanced cancer. He died within nine months of his return home. His position as patriarch and strong personality resulted in a family adrift for many months. Sister Rose, brought a youthful, sunny personality to her warzone assignment. She planned to travel the work but fell in love with a fellow Texan and coworker she met in Talafar Iraq. The impact of the losses and damage to her parents and brothers would redirect her path to home and a new sense of safety with the man she marries. This film chronicles the powerful impact the generally unheralded role the civilian contractors played in the Iraq War and the powerful aftermath of the war on one American middle class family.

Anyone who has googled most African cities like Nairobi will know that the images that come up are not exactly flattering. It's mostly slums, conflict or at best, wildlife.
One day, Mutua Matheka went up to the rooftop of one of the taller buildings in Nairobi and saw the city, from a perspective new even to him. He realised Nairobi is actually beautiful. This moment changed everything. Mutua saw the distortion of what is presented to the world versus what is. He set out to photograph his city, in order to show the beauty he saw in it and, to balance the imagery that introduces the world to Nairobi.
This journey has led him to like-minded individuals who share the passion for shattering the common perceptions associated with African cities. We all share the conviction that perspective shapes what we see and, what we see shapes our mindsets and ideas about places. Together, we are preparing for a new adventure, with the purpose to disrupt the narrative about urban Africa. We have all worked, in our individual capacities, on telling stories from the African continent that educate people about this place we call home – Africa.
We four storytellers are now in preparation for an ambitious road trip around Southern Africa, to capture images that balance existing perceptions of African cities. We would love for you to be part of this quest. As Mutua likes to say, ""together we are stronger and better"". That's why we've chosen crowdfunding as a tool to kickstart this project and why we want you to join our journey.

From Nairobi to Durban, the team will see and document what these cities look like, meet the people that reside in them, discover the sub-cultures and photograph the built environment. The journey, stories and photos will be shared with all who are interested, via various social media platforms.
why cities?
In the city we affectionately refer to as, ""Nairobae""
There are over a billion people living in Africa and it is projected that in the next 15 years, half of them will live in our cities. As city dwellers ourselves, proud citizens of Nairobi, we have seen our city grow and evolve so rapidly in the last 10 years. We have been shaped by these developments and in a way have also shaped the urban landscape and the culture that is inextricably linked to it. 
why Unscrambling Africa?
The scramble and partition of Africa in the 1880’s and 90’s totally interfered with Africa’s progress – its social and economic life. Over a century later, we still live and feel the effects of this partition especially in the separation of people on the continent. It’s hard for Africans to travel within the continent and so it’s hard to have information and experience of what life and people are like in different countries. We have to rely on news channels, whom we see not to share the interest of unifying the continent as their top priority.
Dusk in Cape Town
Unscrambling Africa is a project that seeks to ‘discover’ urban areas all over the continent, from Alexandria to CapeTown, Yaoundé through to Addis Ababa exploring the different personalities to African cities. Mutua has already documented 5 African cities and will be taking this opportunity to photograph 13 more cities to document what urbanity means in the African context. His passion leads him to uncover how we use, define and relate with our spaces in Africa, whether explicitly or implicitly defined; to explore African architecture; to discover how different or similar the cultures of urbanity are in different African cities, and most importantly to share this information so that more of us can gain an insight of what stories our neighbouring cities behold. Undoubtedly photography and video will be one of the most impressionable ways to unscramble our continent.
how we plan to do this
Our visual exploration begins on January 10th 2017.  
We plan to travel to more than 13 cities, on a journey covering 15,000km within a period of 8 weeks – documenting Architecture, public spaces and the people and cultures that exist within them.
We depart from Nairobi and drive through; Tanzania – Malawi – Zambia – Botswana – Namibia – South Africa – Lesotho – Swaziland – Mozambique – Zimbabwe …
…and then all the way back home to Nairobi.
We want our journey to demonstrate what’s possible with imagination, collaboration and action. We want to overturn the widely held belief that it is difficult to cross borders and travel within our continent. Through this we aim to illustrate that the distances between us need not separate us. We will do all this by leveraging off the virtual relationships that we have managed to forge, thanks to social media, internet and mobile technology.

368,1442127675,"Vilka är Teater Satelliten?
Teater Satelliten är en ensemble där personer med och utan diagnoser framför musikaler på professionell nivå. Ensemblens styrka ligger i att lyfta artisternas styrkor på scenen, där du inte alltid vet vem som har andra förutsättningar än det samhället kallar det ""normala"".  
På Teater Satelliten ser vi till varje individs talang och låter dem växa på scen utifrån sina egna förutsättningar. Vi har alla något att lära av varandra och alla ska ha möjlighet att utveckla sin fulla potential på samma villkor. Teater Satelliten står på scenen tillsammans, som EN grupp med samma mål och med samma villkor! Vi vill arbeta för en inkluderande teaterscen oavsett diagnos, ursprung, eller förutsättningar.
En dokumentär om att trotsa hinder och nå oanade höjder
Vi vill skapa en dokumentär som dels följer ensemblens arbete som helhet fram till urpremiären av musikalen Mitt Liv den 15 maj 2019 och dels följa några ur ensemblen mer privat, hur deras medgångar, motgångar och framgångar ser ut i livet. Personer som trotsar sina hinder och utmanar sig själva på vägen mot en professionell karriär.
Här möter du personer som skulle kunna ligga i Sveriges toppelit på kulturscenen, men som pga. av exempelvis psykisk ohälsa, dåliga myndighetsbeslut eller ett samhälle som inte tagit till vara på fördelarna med personens diagnoser, inte fått möjligheten att bidra med sina unika förmågor.
Det finns så mycket talang som bara kastas i papperskorgen, så länge vi inte tillåts ta plats och accepteras för den vi är. I sammanhang tillsammans med andra, oberoende diagnos. Det händer något med oss när någon vågar tro på oss, en känsla av att lyckas och att tro på sig själv.
Öppna upp för mångfald på Sveriges kulturscener!
Vi vill visa att det går att arbeta på en teaterscenen tillsammans oavsett vad du fötts med för förutsättningar. Cirka 10% av Sveriges vuxna säger att de har någon form av funktionsnedsättning och 25% av Sveriges befolkning som har utländsk bakgrund. Men hur avspeglar sig det på Sveriges Kulturscener? Vem är välkommen på Sveriges kulturscener?
Vi visa att när vi väljer att se en människa för deras positiva egenskaper och talang och inte för deras brister och diagnoser, så kan den människan växa till oanade höjder. 
Vårt mål är att dokumentären ska sändas på TV, vilket är ett mål som inte går att garantera. Men vi kommer oavsett att arbeta för att nå ut med vår dokumentär på ett eller annat sätt, även om vi nekas i en TV pitch. Det kan t.ex. vara en miniserie på Youtube, en dokumentär via UR, utbildningsmaterial via andra utbildningsforum, föreläsningar med filmvisning osv. Dokumentären ska leva, utmaningen är bara hur brett vi kan nå.
Stöd vår dokumentär och gör skillnad! 
Hjälp oss att öppna upp för mångfalden på Sveriges kulturscener! Genom vår dokumentär kan vi visa att det går att arbeta på en teaterscenen tillsammans oavsett vad du fötts med för förutsättningar. 
För 6000:- kan vi hyra en professionell videokamera och mikrofon för att skapa dokumentären.
För 15.000 kan vi fortsätta följa vår ensemble i vardagen med professionell fotograf
För 30.000 kan professionell redigerare klippa och redigera dokumentären. 
För 60.000 kan en producent gå igenom materialet och pitcha mot tv."

The Book
The book will be an 5.8""x8.3"" perfect-bound softcover book with a minimalistic soft touch cover. Inside will be 68 pages total of all of the illustrations created throughout the month-long challenge, information about the myths the characters I've created are based on, plus 2 exclusive illustrations which will not be shown in public. Most of the illustrations are black and white, some are additionally highlighted with gold ink.
I will also added 1 exclusive bookmark to every physical copy of the Artbook. The design will be revealed soon.

With this Kickstarter you can help me to make this happen. Thank you also for your long-running support on Instagram.  sinicitas.instagram

370,1706121951,"UPDATE: After meeting our $10,000 goal, we have set a NEW GOAL of $11,900 so that we can visit more locations and talk to more people about how the nuclear industry has impacted their community. Scroll down below to see the breakdown.
For the past two years we have traveled throughout Colorado and New Mexico, interviewing activists and community members whose lives have been impacted by the nuclear weapons industry.  We have listened to stories both heartbreaking and inspiring. We have heard about calling into work sick to go on a Backcountry Action in Nevada to stop an underground nuclear weapons test, about quitting your job to dedicate your life full-time to shutting down Rocky Flats, and we have heard about sickness, death, and imprisonment. In the face of both adversity and triumph, these are stories about solidarity, community and a profound commitment to environmental and racial justice.  
Taylor reviewing footage
Our project is a feature-length experimental documentary and multimedia oral history archive that examines three regions in the west, the former Rocky Flats Plant, the White Sands Missile Range and the Nevada Test Site. Off Country investigates the environmental consequences of the nuclear weapons industry as well as racist and classist policies inherent in the storage, mining, and production of radioactive material. We have driven more than 8000 miles, shot over two and a half hours of 16mm film and collected nearly twenty hours of interviews and field recordings. 
The film was started with a small grant from CU Boulder, this grant allowed us to perform field work for 4 weeks in the summer of 2016. We shot over 2000 feet of film during this period. Since then we have traveled to New Mexico  numerous times and have spent $8,000 on our own conducting fieldwork. Thanks to a small grant from The Puffin Foundation we were able to process and transfer about half of our footage. At bare minimum, we need an additional $10,000 to process the remaining film and transfer it to video. 
In order to continue our work we have started a Kickstarter campaign and invite you to help. We are fiscally sponsored by Basement Films so all donations are tax deductible.

Taylor and Eric location scouting at the gates of White Sands Missile Range
Why Now?
In 1992 the closing of the Rocky Flats Plant outside of Boulder Colorado halted the industrial production of nuclear weapons. There are currently plans underway to construct a plutonium pit production facility at Los Alamos National Labs in New Mexico, in order to modernize the U.S. nuclear stockpile for the 21st Century, despite lingering environmental contamination left by the legacy of the 20th century. 
In the 1940s, New Mexico was chosen as the site for the Manhattan Project and the world's first atomic weapons test because of its remoteness and the military’s perception that “no one” lived there. However, the Mescalero Indian reservation was established just seven miles from ground zero, and Hispanic families had been ranching in the area for generations. What the military meant by “no one” was that no Anglo-Americans lived in the area. 
The film will be bilingual and focus on nuclear weapons testing, manufacturing, and storage, with an emphasis on social justice and environmental restoration. Additionally, the archive will document and catalog a diverse chorus of voices whom history has neglected. This archive will be a tool for researchers, historians, and activists, to learn not only about history but the human stories of people resisting environmental contamination and political oppression.

Impact:
The lives and histories of the communities living around White Sands, Los Alamos National Lab and the extensive uranium mining in New Mexico’s Pueblos is an overlooked and undocumented legacy. New Mexico was intentionally chosen because of its marginalized and underprivileged population. Mining was done on reservations as a way of sidestepping federal and state regulations. The Off Country film and archive will document and bear witness to the struggle of these communities bringing their stories and voices into a broader cultural awareness.
Stretch Goal Details:
Research Trip to Idaho National Laboratory
This is the location of the first operational nuclear power plant but it is also where the contaminated material form Rocky Flats was stored. Later, under pressure from the Idaho legislature the contaminated material was removed and they did a better job cleaning up the stored waste from Rocky Flats then they did cleaning up Rocky Flats itself.
How the Funds Will be Used:
We will use the Kickstarter funds to process and transfer the remaining film that we shot so that we may begin editing. We will also use funds for production trips to Nevada and Idaho.

373,530640974,"It started out in early 2009 as a nebulous thought that kept tickling the mind of Canadian musician, Patrick Lajeunesse: Could he use Indaba Music, an on-line collaborative-music site, to bring together musicians from around the world to write and record original songs dedicated to the twin ideals of peace and freedom?
Patrick proposed his idea in an Indaba ""group"" message and the rest, as they say, is history!
Over the past year, more than fifty musicians from eleven countries have collaborated on and contributed thirty-five songs to Patrick's Peace Partners project.
These songs are truly international in scope. The various Peace Partners composers and collaborators (only a few of whom have ever met in “real life”) hail from the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Italy, Germany, and Australia...to name but a few of the globe-spanning locations these incredibly talented individuals call ""home"". Taking full advantage of modern technology, they composed, discussed, arranged, recorded, refined, mixed, and mastered their musical creations exclusively through on-line collaborations - sharing initial ideas and, ultimately, individual musical contributions, over the Internet.
That's pretty darn amazing, if you think about it!!
The resulting Peace Partners songs are as diverse, musically, as the nationalities of their musical collaborators - ranging from pop to “classic rock” to classical to “world music” to jazz-fusion to good ol’, kick-@ss Rock & Roll…and everything in-between.
And, man, do they sound good!!
But don't take our word for it. We've posted a representative sampling of already-completed Peace Partners songs on a special Web page, where you can go and hear for yourself the amazing music that's created when dedicated musicians from around the globe contribute their talents to a cause they are passionate about. Head over there...crank up your speakers...give 'em a listen...then come back here for the rest of our pitch.
Don't worry. We'll wait...
*tap* *tap* *tap* *tap* (the sound of fingertips tapping on a desktop)
Are you back? Good. Let's continue, shall we?
Once all those incredible Peace Partners songs started rolling in, the next logical question became, what to do with them.
Patrick decided that, assuming all the musicians agreed, he'd find some way to sell these 35-and-counting songs on-line and, if possible, even produce a CD containing 15-20 tracks selected from all those Peace Partners submissions. Patrick also suggested that we donate the proceeds from these sales to established, non-profit organizations whose missions reflect the overarching themes of the various Peace Partners songs: Peace and Freedom.
Well, the musicians all agreed, making their compositions and musical contributions available through ""Creative Commons"" licenses and donating the resulting songs to the Peace Partners project for on-line and CD sales and distribution - so long as the purpose of these sales was to support legitimate non-profit organizations and activities. Patrick, in turn, formed his own non-profit ""pass-through"" organization (fittingly named ""Peace Partners"") and established alliances with Amnesty International Canada and War Child Canada as initial recipients of the potential proceeds from any ""Peace Partners"" music sales. More associations with additional non-profit organizations will surely follow.
And that brings us to where things currently stand: The music's largely completed and ready for release; on-line distribution has already been arranged; the legal channels have been established to process and distribute any proceeds generated by the Peace Partners project. All that remains is to physically produce the hoped-for CD.
Unfortunately, this last step requires something neither Patrick nor the participating musicians possess in excess:
loot...moolah...lucre...
dough...dinero...dosh...
scratch...shekels...simoleons...
in other words...fairly straightforward words: cold, hard cash!!!
And that's where you come in! We need ""seed"" money to...um...""kick-start"" the CD component of the Peace Partners project. (Now do you see how we ended up here?)
The goal of this Kickstarter project is to raise the money required to professionally design and print full-color CD covers, labels and inserts...to replicate at a professional manufacturing plant an initial run of 1,000 CDs containing those 15-20 selected songs mentioned earlier...and, finally, to prepare these 1,000 professionally produced CD packages for marketing and distribution, so they can enter the sales' chain and themselves, in turn, generate the funds required to produce and sell more CDs that, in turn, will pay for more CDs, which, in turn, will...well...you get the picture. Once things gets started, it's a self-perpetuating process.
We just need a little financial backing to start the ball rolling.
So, check out the various ""rewards"" we're offering for different pledge levels, listed over there to the right...pick out a pledge level that's comfortable for you...pry open the ol' wallet or purse...and help us turn our dream of a ""Peace Partners"" CD into reality.
Even if we meet our stated Kickstarter fundraising goal, which we're confident we will, that doesn't mean you should just click away from this page and not submit a pledge. There are a couple of good reasons to help us exceed that initial target of $4,000. You'll not only share the wonderful feeling that comes from being involved in a worthwhile project, you'll also get some amazing music created by some truly talented musicians from all around the world...and any additional funds collected through this project are for a great cause!!
Thank you, in advance, for your belief in our project. If you'd like to learn even more, feel free to visit the Peace Partners Web site.

374,1363968706,"In 2018, I introduced The ImpeachMint Project right here on Kickstarter. The project began as a response to the White House Gift Shop's propaganda-esque commemorative coins praising the Trump administration for events that were skewed or had flat out never happened (remember the coin for the first ""peace talk"" with Kim Jong Un?). I got a lot of love from people all over the world and within just a few days we reached our goal to create the first coin in the series, The Trump Tower Commemorative Coin (aka ""I Love It"").  Since then the project has grown, now with 16 coins and counting, and has been featured in The Guardian, Vice, Artnet, ARTNews, and BoingBoing! I even was able to create a real-life Impeach Mint shop and bring it to life earlier this year at SPRING/BREAK Art Show in NYC. I've also dedicated a portion of all regular direct sales (through my personal website) to benefit various groups that are working on the forefront of important issues; this year, through the sales of Impeach Mint coins, I have raised and donated over $2,000 to Color of Change, the Bail Project, The Loveland Foundation, and Swing Left.
But after almost three years, and with another general election looming, I feel it's time to bring this project to a close. So, no matter how this election turns out, the Impeach Mint Project is now wrapping up its final designs. 
the real-life Impeach Mint installation was featured in Artnet earlier this year when it debuted at SPRING/BREAK Art Show in New York City (pre-covid!)
This Kickstarter campaign is for six new coins and custom cases, bringing the Project to completion.
The six new coins will be dedicated to Pence, Barr, Kushner, Miller, and two yet-to-be-announced people or events. The great news is that I've already raised most of the funds needed through previous sales of coins, so there's only a little more needed to get this last leg up and running. The six new coins will join the rest of the series to complete the full 20-piece Full Collection.
During this Kickstarter campaign, a limited number of 20-piece Full Collections and a la carte coins will be offered at very special pricing.
I tried my best to create a number of backer reward tiers and add-ons so that everyone can get the coins they want, whether it's the full set or just their very favorite design!
THE FULL COLLECTION 
Those backing the ""Full Collection"" reward will receive the entire 20-coin set in a custom made display case (personally by me!).
 Free Shipping in the U.S. and in time for the Holiday season! 
All Full Collection backers will receive an initial shipment in December 2020 that includes a custom display case and all available coins in Air-Tite brand coin acrylic capsules. After that, you will receive monthly shipments of new coins until your collection is complete. 
All rewards ship free within the U.S.! Shipping outside the U.S. calculated by weight and destination.
The Full Collection includes the following:
 Trump Tower Meeting (I Love It) 
 Sarah Huckabee Sanders (The Best Information)

 two yet to be announced coin designs 
 genuine Air-Tite brand acrylic coin capsules 
 signed and numbered certificates of authenticity 
 custom display case 
Question: I see a few different levels for the Full Collection, what's the difference?
Answer: No difference, just some very special pricing at very limited quantities. Back the project early to get the best value available!
À La Carte
If you only want a few coins from the collection, you can still back this project!

3) Add-on a custom display case to any a la carte reward for $250. After the Kickstarter ends I'll communicate with you to make a display case to fit the coins in your personal Impeach Mint Collection.  Ships in March 2021.
4) Add-on a small covid coin to send to a Rep or Senator! Are you frustrated that your elected official (or someone in your life) is still in denial of the magnitude of our national death toll? This add-on ships IMMEDIATELY in mid November to you, with additional shipping insert that's ready to mail. Just add postage, address, and send it off to whoever you think could benefit from this reminder of reality! (Or keep it for yourself). $20, limit one per backer, US addresses only.
PLEASE NOTE: This coin, while still beautiful, is a smaller version of the COVID-19 coin in the official collection. It does not come with a certificate of authenticity. It will come packaged in a protective PVC sleeve. The limited-edition 1.75"" COVID-19 coin in the a la carte list comes in display box/capsule, is numbered, signed, and features finer details.
5) Add-on a misprinted pewter Roger Stone coin! Usually the Impeach Mint gets it right on the first try, but sometimes coins come out looking a little wonky the first time. This is just that situation: Our first pressing of Roger Stone had him with an unusual helmet shape floating above his hair. These unnumbered solid pewter misprints come shipped in protective PVC sleeve. Just $15!
 À La Carte: Your choice of velvet boxes or collector's coin capsule
We got an upgrade! A la Carte coins now come standard with your choice of velvet box or coin capsule. What's the difference? It's really up to you! Velvet boxes make a great gift and make a handsomely display. Acrylic coin capsule's are genuine Air-Tite brand and are designed to protect your coin for years to come. All À La Carte backers will be able to choose their preference of velvet box or coin capsule (sorry, you can't choose both, the boxes won't fit the capsule!). Full Collection backers will receive their coins in Air-Tite capsules that will be held in a single large custom display case.
 Digital Postcard Packs
If you're not ready to become a coin collector, but still want to show some support for the project, you can grab a digital postcard pack! For the cost of a slow-drip coffee, you'll get a digital file containing 9 print-quality postcards images. These postcards debuted in real life in March 2020 at SPRING/BREAK Art Show in New York City. If you got the chance to see the real life installation you might remember these! They were a hit and ran out in just a few days. This digital postcard pack will be included with all coin-level backers as well. Here's just a couple of our favorites:"
375,404231245,"We are working to bring the world a look into the unique collection of Jamie Ross, featuring unusual letters and imagery not traditionally found in Navajo designs. We will first be applying basic conservation to the textiles. After any deterioration effects have been mitigated we will continue photographing each piece with a 4x5 camera. The 4x5 camera will have a digital back, that will give us the opportunity to shoot highly detailed images that could potentially be printed at large sizes. Once each piece has been photographed, they will then be stored in proper archival textile storage to be shipment ready for future exhibitions. Any donations received will cover the cost of archival materials, conservation and photography supplies, and printing costs.
 The collector of the blankets, Jamie Ross, first started his collection at the age of three and has continued to build his collection today. His love and passion for Navajo weaving is what drew to starting this project and in the end a book dedicated to Jamie Ross. The collection itself consists of over 400 blankets and each of them unique because they focus on incorporation the English language into the weaving's. The blankets gives a unique look into pictorial Navajo blankets and the influences that shaped Navajo Nation today. As Native American ourselves, we would want to be able to show the world the diverse history of Navajo weaving and bring new light into traditional Native arts. Please feel free to email back with any questions or concerns. We appreciate your time and support with the project."

Installation Ok ! Tout est prêt ? Eeeet.. on live !
Actuellement basés à Niort nous nous plaisons aussi à proposer des streams sur les jeux actuels, discuter avec les communauté et découvrir avec vous de nouveau jeux vidéo qui font parler d'eux,

On peut nous retrouver sur twitch mais nous sommes aussi présent sur youtube pour les redif et tous le travail que l'on réalise avant et après les events : trailers, vlog, vidéo montage d'un évent etc...

Pour le prochain événement nous avons une place de choix au Stunfest  pour rediffuser le tournoi de Super Smash Bros Wii U le 20 Mai dès 12h, la scène versus fighting la plus hype de france !!

Pour vous inscrire c'est par ici !
 Avec un événement de cette ampleur, nous nous devons de présenter le meilleurs stream qu'il faut pour la communauté, de bonne qualité, sans freezes, sans problèmes de son, avec des animateurs de qualité, et des commentaires au top du top !
Mais pour ça il nous les faut des moyens, c'est la qu'on fait appel à vous !
Image non contractuelle d'un mec qui commente du Sm4sh
 On commence par le plus important : le cast !
Car avoir de la qualité c'est aussi avoir de la voix, un bon débit de paroles et connaitre le jeu sur le bout des doigts, pas facile quand on s’occupe du stream de rester concentré sur le jeu qui se déroule,
Mais évidemment, les faire venir représente aussi un coût ;)
La somme totale réunie sera déterminante sur le choix des commentateurs pour caster au Stunfest le tournoi de Super Smash Bros Wii U, ils passeront aussi bien sur le stream que sur la scène principale devant plus de 500 personnes et représenter du mieux possible la communauté de Super Smash Bros !
Notre matériel se retrouve inlassablement en panne et chaque évènement on a un petit lot de : boitier d'acquisition qui déconne, le splitter HDMI hors service, les cable HDMI avec des pattes arrachées, les micro grésilles sans raisons ou les casques qui se font voler, notre matériel en voit de toute les couleurs pendant nos déplacements !
La logistique aussi, bien qu'on se fasse rembourser par les organisateurs la plupart du temps, les frais liés à la route comme les petites pannes et réparations ne sont pas non plus anodins,
 En conclusion, l'argent ainsi récoltée grâce à ce kickstater servira exclusivement au casting pour le Stunfest et aussi au stream Canapé Fight à l'amélioration de la qualité de nos rediffusions,
Et pas de panique si vous ne pouvez pas aider financièrement, un partage du projet sur vos réseaux sociaux sera tout aussi apprécié ! 
        Mille merci pour votre aide ! :D

380,1613452499,"I've always been inspired by cooking shows and travel documentaries, and especially people that are able to combine the two! And that inspiration has pushed me to want to make my own video series dedicated to food, and drink, and travel, and eventually turn it into something that can then inspire others the way I've been inspired. 
In order to do that, I've gotta start somewhere. And that somewhere is here. I hope to be able to turn these early videos into a channel that focuses on culture and culinary arts, but also focuses on the history and ecology of the world around us. I plan to start locally in the cities around me, expand to the rest of the states, and then one day to other countries around the world, exploring new cultures and ways of life and sharing with people their rich and vibrant history, their incredible culinary delights, their exquisite drinks, and their incredible music, as well as touch on how people around the world are affected by the things we do elsewhere and how we can help other cultures, and our own, continue and thrive for future generations.
It sounds like a lot, and I know projects of this scale seem like they could be insurmountable. But I know with your help, I really can make this come true. I just need that little kickstart to help me get this off the ground. Whatever funds I can't raise through here, I will raise by myself. Because this isn't just some dream. It's a legitimate goal, and I will make it happen. But I know I could make it happen much sooner with your help and contributions. 
Each camera I'm planning on using only costs $45 each, lighting is another $37, camera accessories like tripods and handles are $30, and the final cost would be memory cards at $20 a pop."

The Concept is simple, A Flint Resident will post a bill need and we will help them reach their goal!
Life Line Me empowers residents to raise money for monthly bills during the ongoing water crisis. Flint residents can create a campaign need on the platform and people around the world can assist them in reaching desired goals This platform will provide Flint MI residents with the tools to meet their needs with the help of your peers. Our goal is to provide both a superior customer experience and tremendous value into the people of Flint lives. Life Line Me is a Platform dedicated To Flint MI Residents Effected By The Flint Water Crisis.
The Flint water crisis began in 2014 when the drinking water source for the city of Flint, Michigan was changed to the Flint River. Due to insufficient water treatment, over 100,000 residents were potentially exposed to high levels of lead in the drinking water. After a pair of scientific studies proved lead contamination was present in the water supply, a federal state of emergency was declared in January 2016 and Flint residents were instructed to use only bottled or filtered water for drinking, cooking, cleaning, and bathing. As of early 2017, the water quality had returned to acceptable levels; however, residents were instructed to continue to use bottled or filtered water until all the lead pipes have been replaced, which is expected to be completed no sooner than 2020.
This city still needs assistance both in the form of clean drinking water and direct funds to families in need. The platform does not charge any fees to its users at this time and all funds raised pour back into Flint Michigan’s community.  
Assist us in spreading the word! Sow & Reap Greatness.

Extraversal Year 1
A quest to unite 99 magical swords. A ship at play in the space between worlds. A mysterious walled city. A vast alien being in a broken century. A cat and a meringue.
Welcome to the worlds of Big Punch Studios.
From the creators of 7STRING and Afterlife Inc. comes Extraversal, a quarterly magazine serialising five ongoing series from the Big Punch Multiverse. Now, for the first time, issues 1-4 of Extraversal are being collected as a luxury, 164-page graphic novel.
Extraversal Year 1 has arrived. Time to fly.
Enter the Extraverse, the space between worlds, in the pages of CUCKOOS, as the crew of the Reflektor set sail in search of trade, adventure and perhaps a home…
A giant stone warship appears in the skies of an alternate New York in ORB, casting utopia into chaos, and leaving the fate of the world in the hands of a young girl and a superhuman prophet…
Years ago, a legendary swordsmith forged 99 SWORDS of great power. Now, in a world forever changed by their magic, Elsie Blackwood joins the ranks of Swordhunters seeking to unite the 99 Swords and claim the ultimate prize…
High above the city of Prizm, Cyanne and her skilled team of catchers defend their home from showers of deadly crystals, ever wondering what lies beyond THE WALL that separates them from the outside world…
Fresh from their 1,000 days of adventures, CAT AND MERINGUE return for more mirth and madness on an ocean of possibilities…
Hi. We're Big Punch Studios (a.k.a. Nich, Lucy, Jon and Ali) and together we make all manner of adventures in comics and games. We're the team behind 7STRING and Afterlife Inc., and we also made Sandwich Masters, a game of strategy, sabotage and sandwiches. Together, we handle all aspects of production on Extraversal, from script to art to publication, with help from our amazing team of freelance artists: Jack, Verity and James.
We began publishing Extraversal in 2015 as a way of telling more stories from our expanding multiverse. But don't be fooled: while the genres are different - spanning sci-fi, fantasy and comedy - this is one world, one story, told from different angles. Characters walk between pages, appearing in unexpected places. A mystery is developing across the Extraverse, and it's too big for any one universe to contain.
The individual issues of Extraversal are available to our Patrons and followers as a subscription service, but you can catch up on the story so far on our website. We're so excited to bring the collected edition of Extraversal Year 1 to life as a beautiful new book. We hope you enjoy reading it as much as we've enjoyed working on it.
Thanks for your time, gang. Welcome to our worlds.

""The thing about Sylvia Juncosa - the woman can play guitar. And she has a style all her own."" - Music Connection Magazine
""One of the last of the true rock 'n roll wild ones"" - Tip Magazine, Germany
Sylvia Juncosa is a unique figure in rock n' roll - a wild guitar bandit queen with serious skills, a tender singer with thoughtful lyrics, a restless soul who traveled the world. With a brash stage persona and an innovative musical style that bounds exuberantly between alternative rock, hard rock, psychedelic and '60's, Sylvia has been called ""the female Jimi Hendrix"". She first made a name for herself in the Los Angeles music scene of the 1980's, as one of very few bold, expressive and unique female guitarists of the time. During the '80s and '90s her career included two albums with her early band To Damascus, three solo albums under the name Sylvia Juncosa, an album  with the SST band SWA, numerous compilations and guest appearances, and extensive touring of the U.S. and Europe, including a U.S. tour as the opening band for Soundgarden, until at last in the later 1990's she mysteriously disappeared from the public eye. 
Now Sylvia is back, with a batch of strong songs and determined to make her best album ever. She is currently in the process of recording with one of the finest rhythm sections Los Angeles has to offer: on bass and backing vocals is Steve Reed (Legal Weapon, Carnage Asada), and on drums is Joe Berardi (Deadbeats, Double Naught Spy Car, Abby Travis) and John Montgomery (Virginia City Revival, Breakestra). 
We ask for your help to get this project completed. Funding will cover completion of the recording, and pressing of CDs with nice packaging, lyric sheet insert, and fold out panels featuring photos and artwork. We believe the packaging should be like the LPs of the past, with a wealth of material to read and look at while listening to the album.   "

Our Vinyl Weighs A Ton (2014)
The alternative punk story of a fiercely independent, avant-garde record label, offers an exclusive look into the label's left-of-centre artists, history, culture and global following. Stones Throw Records was born with a love for hip-hop, but is inspired by music in all its diversity. Home to innovative leftfield producers like Madlib and J Dilla, the Stones Throw story is laced with tragedy, yet the label owner's single-minded pursuit of the music he loves, ensures it continues as a vital force in the digital music era. 
The film features exclusive interviews with Kanye West, Snoop Dogg, Common, Questlove, Talib Kweli, Mike D (The Beastie Boys), and many more.
There are several London Premieres included in the Doc’n Roll line-up, beginning with:
A Band Called Death (2012)
London Premiere Screening
19:30 Thursday 25th September 
This SXSW 2013 Audience Award Winner is directed by Mark Christopher Covino and Jeff Howlet about the first black punk band (or arguably the first ever punk band). The film looks at the three teenage brothers who dared to be different during the 1970s Motown and Disco era. Whilst their music may have been ahead of their time, three decades later Death’s music was rediscovered by a new audience and the band finally received the recognition they deserved.

UK Premiere - Including a live Q&A with the Director
A Life In The Death Of Joe Meek (2014)
Screening 19:45 Sunday 28th September
+ Live Q&A with the Director
This feature documentary chronicles an original recording industry Punk; the brilliant rise, tragic fall and the eventual resurrection of Joe Meek, Britain's first independent pop record producer. 
Considered a Svengali by some in the industry, Joe nurtured hundreds of teen artists such as Jimmy Page, Steve Howe (of Yes and Asia), Ritchie Blackmore (Deep Purple and Rainbow), session guitarist extraordinaire Big Jim Sullivan and Chas Hodges (Chas 'n Dave) that helped define new, exciting, commercial sounds and produced pop/rock records that were the first specifically targeted at the new post WW2 teen market. By 1967 he was dead.
Over 40 years after his tragic and mysterious death, Meek has been reborn as an inspirational icon for anyone in search of the Independent Spirit.
Featuring contributions from Jimmy Page, Edwyn Collins, Alex Kapranos, and members of Super Furry Animals and the B-52's.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are delighted to announce the UK Premiere of Her Aim Is True (2014)
This is the incredible and unlikely story of the first woman rock photographer of cool, Jini Dellaccio and her pivotal but hidden role in American rock ‘n roll history. She visualised punk before it had a name and embodied indie before it was cool. 
Snubbing convention, Dellaccio reinvented herself in the mid 1960s as one of the most daring and innovative composers in the field, working with legendary rockers from The Sonics to Neil Young, and capturing candid moments of early live performances by bands such as The Who, The Rolling Stones and The Mamas & Papas. An anthem for individual creativity, the film celebrates a legacy lost and found, as it traces Dellaccio's ingenuity, spirit and style through participants, in a gritty music subculture that like, Dellaccio, would set the bar for their descendants.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exclusive London Screening - Including a live Q&A with the Director
Looking for Johnny (2014)
Screening 21:00 Friday, 26th September
A brand new documentary on the life of the late New York Dolls and Heartbreakers guitarist Johnny Thunders, will also be included in this year’s programme. Director Danny Garcia talked to the fifty people who were closest to the rocker about his music which inspired punk and glam-metal and his hard lifestyle which lead to his untimely demise at 38.

Retrospective Strand
For our inaugural 4-day festival, the retrospective strand will focus on the work of British director Julien Temple, with docs including LONDON: The Modern Babylon (2012), Joe Strummer: The Future is Unwritten (2007), plus the Dr. Feelgood epic, Oil City Confidential (2009). 
Zoe Howe is an author with a unique insight to Dr. Feelgood's two protagonists. Having co-authored the Wilko Johnson book, Looking Back At Me, she is currently writing a biography on lead singer, Lee Brilleaux. 
Zoe will host an extensive Q&A session with Julien Temple, following the Oil City screening, including an exclusive opportunity to hear about Julien's forthcoming Kinks biopic, and to see a taster of his upcoming doc on Wilko Johnson.
Oil City Confidential (2009)
Screening 20:30 Saturday, 27th September
+ Live Q&A with Julien Temple
A film noir feature length documentary about Dr Feelgood; it's the story of four men in cheap suits who crashed out of Canvey Island in the early '70s, sandpapered the face of rock’n’roll and left all that came before a burnt-out ruin, four estuarine John-the-Baptists to Johnny Rotten’s anti-Christ. Cannibalizing the visual flotsam and jetsam of our society, welding into an emotionally engaging and humorous whole, Oil City Confidential sets out to explore this unique time, place and social landscape - all of which was responsible for shaping the identity of the band and which, more than any other, defined the strange cultural vacuum which existed before the coming of punk rock.
Joe Strummer: The Future is Unwritten (2007) - an original 35mm print screening. 
Screening 17:30 Saturday 27th September
Filmmaker Julien Temple takes a look beyond the guise of the late, anti-establishment icon Joe Strummer to offer a warm portrait of the self-described ""mouthy little git"" who was born John Mellor and was destined to become the frontman for one of the most influential punk bands ever. A complex figure who would learn to use his gift for music as a means of decompressing his conscience, Strummer is revealed here through unearthed interviews and the illuminating recollections of his closest companions. At times idealistic to a fault, the flawed Clash singer/songwriter had a special gift for compelling listeners to think as they moved to the music. Vintage performance footage and excerpts from Strummer's popular BBC radio program offer the ideal musical backdrop for an affectionate tribute to a punk-rock legend. - Jason Buchanan, Rovi
LONDON: The Modern Babylon (2012)
Screening 15:00 Saturday, 27th September
+ Live Q&A
Julien Temple draws on a century of music and film archive to tell the story of London’s epic journey through 100 years of cultural upheaval and reinvention. Among the line-up of familiar faces are David Bowie, Ray Davies, Bishi, Mick Jagger, Malcolm McLaren as well as the ordinary folks of London, from all walks of life. The extraordinary soundtrack spans 100 years of London music including iconic tracks from the Sex Pistols, The Clash, Small Faces, Lily Allen, Pink Floyd, Roxy Music, The Kinks, Madness, Bob Marley through to Tommy Trinder, Max Bygraves, Vera Lynn, Lonnie Donnegan, Murray Johnson and Robert Burns, plus many more.
“An astonishing film...a rousing, powerful portrait of a city'” - Dave Colhoun, Time Out
“Julien Temple's throbbing documentary celebrates London's bloody-minded spirit” - Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian

Hüsker Dü's Grant Hart
Every Everything: the music, life & times of Grant Hart (2013)
Screening - 18:30 Saturday, 27th September
 This is the story of a Punk Rock pioneer. It’s 100% unfiltered, unrestrained Grant Hart. The former Hüsker Dü co-songwriter/singer/drummer welcomes you into his world, immediately addresses any Hüsker Dü reunion possibilities in an old interview, and is shown wailing behind his kit during that renowned middle-American punk band’s heyday.
What follows is a revelatory exploration of a singularly unique artistic force, one whose creative career is often overshadowed by that of his former band mate, and who finally, rightfully, gets a moment in the spotlight. It’s an oral, and aural, history of Hüsker Dü’s so-called “wild one”, from his rocky family life through the formation of his most well-known band; from their bitter break-up into the musical projects that followed; from his troubled past to his hopes for the future. This is one of the most off-the-wall, yet riveting conversations that you will witness for a long time, a no-holds-barred history of rock and roll and an insider view of the music industry.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And now for something totally different....
The Punk Syndrome (2012)
Screening 18:30 Friday, 26th September
This is a documentary like no other. It tells the wonderful story of Finnish punk band - Pertti Kurikka's Name Day. Four very lovable punk musicians with learning difficulties fight, fall in love, and become national heroes on their road to conquer the world. Essentially, a story of four guys with little in common except great musical chemistry, and how that binds them together!
""Rough, rousing and raucous rock-doc"" - Total Film
""Really is extraordinary stuff: four middle-aged men who are not the most obvious rocker material, raging against the machine in an undeniably impressive way"" - The Guardian
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HARRY DEAN STANTON: PARTLY FICTION is a mesmerizing, impressionistic portrait of the iconic actor comprised of intimate moments, film clips and his own heartbreaking renditions of American folk songs.

Stunningly lensed in color and b/w, the film explores the actor's enigmatic outlook on his life, his unexploited talents as a musician, and includes candid scenes with David Lynch, Wim Wenders, Sam Shepard, Kris Kristofferson and Debbie Harry.

The fragile soul of an actor who uses his medium to express otherwise unspoken truths emerges from the beautiful collage.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All festival screenings will take place at Hackney Picturehouse, 25th - 28th September 2014.
Final programme to be announced early September, so stay tuned!

 Rock Docs For The People!"
387,2051500345,"The Royal Enfield Bullet, born in England during the golden age of British motorcycle manufacturing, has an even more interesting story. In 1955, it arrived in India and through an unlikely series of events, wove itself into the hearts and minds of the Indian population and has been effectively frozen in time for the past six decades.
Today, however, the motorcycle that generations of riders, mechanics, enthusiasts and purveyors have championed is changing. As the Royal Enfield Company has already begun to usher in a new era with new engines and new models and an aim at global markets. This film captures the story of what this motorcycle was, is and what it could, should or will be.
Chasing the Bullet explores India’s long love affair with the Bullet, its mystique and its charm, told by a handful varying personalities and perspectives to paint a picture of what the Royal Enfield has meant, and still means to the people of India, before this very motorcycle writes yet another chapter of its own history.
Trailer #1

What people are saying about this project
Here is a lengthy interview I did in Bombay with Motonomous&Co 
Some more words from RoyalEnfields.com 
And some support from Bike Middle East Magazine 
 Follow along on Facebook for more updates here
A history of Chasing the Bullet from the creator, Chris Zahner
The magnitude and intrigue of this subject struck me in the Nepalese Himalayas in 2011, when I had my first encounter with the Royal Enfield Bullet. I became infected by the feeling of this motorcycle and its history.
The concept of this film began as a modest project document - how this machine has affected a nation - a single man team with a lightweight camera, lighting and audio rig to traverse the subcontinent of India in search of the incredible stories this machine has to offer.
The project was launched on kickstarter at the end of 2014 and did not reach its funding goal. Not dissuaded, I left for India anyway with a meager amount of savings, determined to capture a people’s history of the Royal Enfield.
Since arriving in India, the project has taken on a life of its own, the entire Royal Enfield community knows about Chasing the Bullet and it has receive serious praise and support. I’ve already covered a large portion of India including Delhi, Jaipur, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Goa Kerala and Punjab. I’ve sat for on-camera interviews with several major authorities on the subject, old mechanics, young riders and more, all who carry the of the Royal Enfield.
The first trailer of the film was presented at the Motorcycle Adventure Film Festival India with massive praise and as one other filmmaker there noted “never has such a film had so much hype before it was even released.”
Today, my tiny budget has been nearly exhausted and there is still half of the film to shoot, then post production, etc.
The Teasers
I've cut several of these short teasers with various authorities on the Royal Enfield that give some peeks at what I've captured so far without giving too much away. Even in such short clips, however. you can already see the contradictory nuance of this machine. The stories just keep getting better and better and there are more teasers on the way!

Where does my money go? 
A majority of the structure of the film relies on film shot in the Himalayas. To properly do this, there will be several people involved, other cameramen, supplies, fuel, support vehicle, etc. Once filming concludes in mid-July, post-production begins. 
Although I will be editing the narrative of the film myself, it will require hired help for graphics, color grading and sound mastering as well as a unique soundtrack made specifically for this film.
Of course, some of the funds will go to creating the reward packages themselves.
Rewards
The film category of kickstarter can present a challenge for filmmakers when coming up with packages. Producing a film is very costly and the price in which people pay to see films is very low (if payed for at all).
It's up to the project creator to come up with unique reward packages that relate to the film and have tangible value. Additionally, most of this audience resides in India where the spending power of the Rupee is much less than other western currencies. So, I've come up with range of reward packages that provide value at a few different costs.
Tackling that issue first is the $5 reward package. This gets your name in the ""post-roll"" credits. For this small amount, you will have your name permanently attached to this film as a major thanks for helping its completion. Also, every backer of every reward package of greater value will receive their name in the credits.
The rest of the reward packages are pretty self explanatory but there are two that I would like to highlight below...
The T-Shirt is made from high quality cotton and includes the Chasing the Bullet logo as well as an exploded view of a 1951 Royal Enfield engine - the precursor to the legendary ""iron barrel"" engine that can be seen all over India today.
The Piston is sourced from various places around India. There's no telling exactly where these pistons have been, but they've seen an entire life of duty. They've been cleaned, laser etched with the Chasing the Bulet logo and then polished. I find such a memento to have a major ""cool"" factor. Put it on a shelf, in your trophy room or use it as a paper-weight in your shop or office as a. immortal reminder of the legendary Bullet. These pistons will be individually numbered starting at 001 and will be delivered sequentially in the order that backers of this package pledge their support.
Thanks for looking into this project. I hope you find it as moving and interesting as I have. I look forward to continuing this ride with all of you.
Cheers,
Chris Zahner"

This is something I have been planning on doing for a long time but it's just taking the courage to get it actually done! This enamel pin is one based of a sketch I did for instagram that became quite popular. So in honour of that, I have turned it in to a pin design. I hope this to be the first of many pins that I will do as part of my art career! I will be forever grateful to anyone who chooses to help make this a reality for me.

If you chose to back this, you will get one (or more, depending on the tier you back!) of the Night Watch Owl pin as envisioned below. Any remaining pins will be sold on my online store. This is just a small kickstarter to get an idea of how this whole thing works! In time, I plan to make more elaborate kickstarters with larger stretch goals too! Keep up to date with everything I do and plan by clicking the owl and following me on Instagram.
Thank you!

STRETCH GOALS OVERVIEW "
390,492047607,"Last summer was one for the history books on my end. It was chock full of exploration and excitement! When it ended however, I made a pact with myself to make this upcoming summer the best one yet! I want to show the world how fun life can be living in SoCal. The raves, the parties, the beaches, hiking trails, amusement parks and camp spots are all planned out and now I just need the tools to show off this season of serenity. I have always wanted to make a documentary of some sorts, show the world my side of the story. I'm a care free individual who just wants to see others succeed and be happy, so I want to share this perspective with everyone and let them see how awesome life is and can be. All we have to do is take a leap of faith and cast our fears and doubts aside. This isn't just to show off how awesome of a summer a 20 year old man could have. I'm also doing this to inspire people to live life doing what they love and not what society forces on us!"
391,471494009,"Busters Nuts!  Opensource Game
We are developing an OPEN SOURCE Game for the Android & iPhone which is built on opensource animation from the Big Buck Bunny film.  Before we get into why we are asking for $ 10,000, we are introducing you to the history of Big Buck Bunny!
In 2008 The Blender Project Made an open source movie!  This was an early version of crowd sourcing projects; a year or so before Kickstarter was born. ""Big Buck Bunny"" was the title of the short animated film which most thought had enough quality production, design and marketing to rival big production studios.  
We are continuing the development of those resources with new updated storyline games.
The Movie
Big Buck Bunny tells the story of a giant rabbit with a heart bigger than himself. When one sunny day three rodents rudely harass him, something snaps... and the rabbit ain't no bunny anymore! In the typical cartoon tradition he prepares the nasty rodents a comical revenge. 

Enjoy......
Big Buck Bunny
Big Buck Bunny, the animated short movie, is all open source while being creative commons copyrighted for use by others!  The art, animation, characters can be used by others as long as you give credit to the original creator.  The source to Big Buck Bunny is always available here.  The production files can be found here.
Our Project is OPEN SOURCE.  We are using the Creative Commons 3 copyright for this project.  After release, the game files and art will be available online.  We give thanks to original creators of the peach project.
The world will be able to make many iphone/iPad Windows 8 and Android versions
Previous Games about Big Buck Bunny
We know of one other Game with Blender that involves Big Buck Bunny characters.  The game can be found here YoFrankie.
Yofrankie is a great example of the Blender System at work!  However, YoFrankie was built before the mass adoption of mobile devices like the iPhone and Android.  We are creating a whole series of Games Based on the Big Buck Bunny and Sintel movies for mobile devices; but for now we are focusing on one AWESOME GAME for the iPhone and Android!
""Busters Nuts"" Re-boot Big Buck Bunny!
The Game story begins at the end of the movie.  The bird (some say Twitter Bird is based on) decides to take his revenge first on Frankie (Head of the Busters Nuts Gang).  
Dr Evil Eye is our Villan bird and he is after everyone - EVEN YOU!  The Busters Nuts Gang needs your help to save Big Buck Bunny.  
After DEE (Short for Dr Evil Eye) enslaves Big Buck Bunny in a secret underground tunnel system you must help the Busters Nuts Gang penetrate it to save him!  Beware, DR Evil Eye has many tricks up his sleeve.
The NEW GAME Trailer
NOTE: You last Saw DR Evil Eye in a Verizon Droid ad!
Main Stream as Verizon uses DR EVIL EYE!
If you watch TV lately you will see DR Evil Eye on the Droid Phone ad.  This is a out take of the nasty bird and our new villan on TV.  This all part of the re-boot of Big Buck Bunny into various C3 license media.

Stretch Goal 1 $ 17,500 (30 Level Game)
Stretch Goal 1 $ 17,500 (30 Level Game) The stretch Goal 1 is to render and set 30 levels of Game play based upon the movie but with a twist. Now only a little bit of the artwork has been disclosed because we have many unique levels that are AWESOME!

Besides, this game production art and files will be easily available for download to make your own alternative game!  
Stretch Goal 3 $ 30,000 
We will create several (2) original characters to add higher levels of the game and open source them.  The characters will be Dr Evil Eye side kick and a monkey (Blender Monkey) and the butterfly seen in the movie.
Stretch Goal 4 $ 50,000
We will ad another 10 levels of unique play to the game.
Stretch Goal 5 $ 100,000
We will set up the Sequel of a 2nd game title based upon the Blender Film Sintel.  We will include a SNOW bonus round (see our game design methods in Risk section) to be awarded at random times in the Game.  Where a smaller Dragon has to out wit Dr Evil Eye to gather power and strength and time shift into a different realm (the Sintel World).  This Bonus round will include the Busters Nuts Gang too.  Any funding over 100,000 will have future stretch rounds announced.  More than likely these rounds will include greater character play sets and more bonus rounds of Sintel for now.
GAME TIME ......
""Busters Nuts"" a Big Buck Bunny Game!
How we make Games
Our process to making games is unique and uses the best of breed tools available to small game developers.
We generate most of the game art (Scenes, actors, and other objects) with Blender open source tools.  The physics of the game are designed with Game Salad and Unity.  Depending upon the game budget and overal story board, we pick which tool is a best fit for the build.  Audio sources are purchased from third party audio studios."

A nation reveals itself not only by the men [and women] it produces but also by the men [and women] it honors, the men [and women] it remembers. — John F. Kennedy 
Veterans Memorials of San Diego County: In Pictures is a project to educate the public about these memorials’ locations and meanings. It will be a photobook, and as a PDF it will include links to maps precisely pinpointing each memorial’s location (often visible from space via Google Earth). It will also include links to a memorial's donors, artists, and additional online information when available.
Note that the many memorials on military sites are generally not accessible to non-military visitors due to security concerns post-9/11. So the images in this photobook will be the only practical way to view and learn about those memorials.
Funding will cover the cost of some additional photo equipment specific to architectural photography, and travel expenses. This will support the photobook being available free of charge to veterans and their families.

Vermeer of the Borscht Belt is an in-depth documentary tracing Friedman's evolution from underground comics to the cover of the New Yorker.
Friedman grew up in the New York literary scene of his father, writer Bruce Jay Friedman, but he was more at home with the Three Stooges, Car 54 and MAD magazine. Vermeer of the Borscht Belt traces fifty years of American popular culture through the unique lens of Drew Friedman.

Drew Friedman's latest work More Heroes of the Comics is a sequel to his acclaimed Heroes of the Comics. Spanning the birth of the industry to its first few decades, this book has approximately 100 full-color portraits of the legends of American comic books―publishers, editors, and artists. Its subjects are popular and obscure, men and women, and it includes several pioneering artists of color.
More About Drew Friedman:
Drew Friedman is an award-winning illustrator whose work regularly appears in dozens of major publications. For years he was renowned for his ""stippling"" style of caricature, employing thousands of pen-marks to achieve photographic verisimilitude, but in recent years Friedman has switched to painting. His painstaking attention to detail and parodies of Hollywood icons is widely admired.
Friedman's work has appeared in Entertainment Weekly, Newsweek, Time, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The New Yorker, The New Republic, The New York Observer, Esquire, RAW, Rolling Stone, and MAD Magazine.
Friedman attended New York's School of Visual Arts from 1978 to 1981, studying under such legendary masters as Will Eisner, Harvey Kurtzman, Edward Sorel, Stan Mack, and Arnold Roth. He launched his career in the 1980s writing and illustrating morbid alternative comics, often collaborating with brother Josh Alan Friedman. These stories depicted various B-list celebrities, such as Abbott and Costello, Tor Johnson, and Joe Franklin, in seedy, absurd, tragicomic situations. Friedman's work won high praise from Kurt Vonnegut Jr., who compared him to Goya, and Robert Crumb, who wrote, ""I wish I had this guy's talent.""
During the 1980s and early '90s, Friedman's comics were published in Heavy Metal, Weirdo, High Times, and National Lampoon. The Friedman brothers published two collections, Any Similarity to Persons Living or Dead is Purely Coincidental and Warts and All.
In 1986, Friedman introduced a monthly feature, ""Private Lives of Public Figures,"" for (the now-defunct) SPY magazine; these were collected in a book published by St. Martin's Press in 1992. He provided illustrations for Howard Stern's two best-selling books, Private Parts and Miss America. Friedman served as comics editor for the National Lampoon in 1991, and since 1994 has provided front-page illustrations for the New York Observer.
In 2006, Friedman published Old Jewish Comedians, a collection of portraits of famous and forgotten Jewish comics of film and TV in their old age. Steven Heller, in the New York Times Book Review, proclaimed it ""a festival of drawing virtuosity and fabulous craggy faces, . . . Friedman might very well be the Vermeer of the Borscht Belt."" Jerry Lewis chimed in: ""Jesus Christ I love it! Holy Moly what a book!"" The following year he published a collection of newer work, The Fun Never Stops!, including many comics co-written by his frequent collaborator and wife, K. Bidus. Booklist tabbed it one of the Ten Best Comics Collections of 2007. More Old Jewish Comedians was published in 2008. (Here's a Wall Street Journal article about a March 2014 exhibit of Friedman's ""Old Jewish Comedians"" art held at the Society of Illustrators, in New York.)
A collection of magazine illustrations and fine art portraits, Too Soon: Famous/Infamous Faces 1995–2010 (Fantagraphics), was published in Fall 2010, followed in 2011 by Drew Friedman's Sideshow Freaks (Blast Books), which presented 50 color portraits of strange and bizarre (and real) circus entertainers from bygone years.
Friedman was recognized for his work with the National Cartoonist Society Newspaper Illustration Award for 2000, and was nominated again in 2002 and 2007. That organization also awarded Friedman their Magazine Illustration Award for 2000. His work has been included in nine volumes of the American Illustration annual.
Friedman and Bidus share their home with adorable champion beagles."
398,662043812,"It felt like jumping off a cliff. 
I abandoned a high-paying office job to chase a dream. And this book is the result.
I know it sounds crazy, but becoming an author meant more to me than money or peace of mind. And as you’ll see, I’ve gone quite far on my own, but I’ve arrived at a threshold that can only be crossed with a team of faithful companions. Without you, I may have to turn back—abandon the quest. 
It’s not like I’m failing though. First I went back to school for a master’s of English. I even studied under Brandon Sanderson for a semester. Then I wrote and published three books. My novel ECKSDOT has gotten an average of 4.7 / 5 stars on Amazon. Better than I expected. In many ways, my daring leap has paid off.
Now I’m an indie author. (Which is like an indie band but with more groupies.)
I’m living the dream. Well, almost. 
See, as an indie, you have to be an artist and a businessman. And now I’ll admit something that makes me feel pretty vulnerable: After two years, I’m not making enough to live on. My budget is in the red each month, my savings are dwindling, and my dream is on the verge of collapse. But, again, the problem isn’t quality. It’s a matter of momentum. I haven’t reached the tipping point. 
So I’m reaching out to you, my friends and backers. My future depends on you.
I’m on the fourth draft of a story called SONG OF LOCKE. It’s about a boy who takes a dare that leads him on a wild adventure to rescue a Goddess. It has already gotten great feedback, and it’s still three drafts from perfect. I know you’re going to love it. And I need your support to make it a reality—to fund the paperback edition so it can reach more readers. But I’m not actually asking you to back a book. 
I’m asking you to back a dream.
THE NOVEL
When I was a kid, I obsessed over heroes—like Luke Skywalker and Avatar Aang.
And it just killed me when their stories ended.
I tried to fill the gap by collecting action figures and reading mediocre novelizations. I even made a wooden sword with a nailed crosspiece and took it on imaginary quests—trying to find more of that substance called adventure. 
As an adult, I still have that drive. But now I’m furiously writing instead, trying to contribute to the library of legend (imagine Jack Black saying, “library of legend”—there you go). I want to make more of those stories I’ve always craved. And that’s where SONG OF LOCKE comes in.
Inspired by classics like Legend of Zelda, SONG OF LOCKE is the story of an ordinary boy. His tale begins when a bloodthirsty band called the Unstoppable Hundred passes through the Enchanted Forest. From a nearby hiding place, Picke—a musical spirit of air—dares Locke to follow the warriors. Little does Locke realize that this small, fateful choice will lead him onto a hero’s path. And, with just enough guts to begin, he soon finds himself on a quest to rescue a Goddess—something he never expected—and a marvelous adventure follows, one with ancient ruins, snarling wolves, magical swords, and dragon flights.
MY QUALIFICATIONS
You know Brandon Sanderson—the guy who finished The Wheel of Time?
He’s my mentor.
Even if he’d never admit it.
I took his novel-writing class during my master’s of English. Probably all his students claim him as mentor, but isn’t it obvious that I—ha ha, and I alone—am his preeminent pupil? His critical feedback helped me polish ECKSDOT for publication, and he wrote this on the manuscript: “You are good with emotion and... have a good instinct of dramatic style.” (Here's his site: http://brandonsanderson.com/ And, no, he’s not officially endorsing this project.) As I mentioned, ECKSDOT launched to critical success. I’m telling you this to show I’ve worked hard to become a good writer.
But the truth is my success isn’t entirely mine. Several fine mentors have trained me—I've mentioned just one. Plus I have a secret weapon: I’ve recruited dozens of beta readers—amazing, smart people—to give me crowdsourced feedback. They’re top-notch, no kidding. They’re lawyers, English graduates, and Legend of Zelda experts. They’re people who’ve found typos in the Harry Potter books. Most importantly, they’re readers who love good stories. Their insights help me make each draft more polished and profound than the last, pushing SONG OF LOCKE from good to great.
Their feedback makes me confident you’ll love it.
And I’m going to invite some of you backers to join their ranks too—if you’re willing.
BACKER REWARDS
The ebook will be in your hands by Christmas 2014. Backers receiving ebooks will get both Kindle (.mobi) and Ebook (.epub) formats, DRM-free. The paperback will be shipped to you a month later, by the end of January 2015 (and possibly sooner).
Backers may be selected as ""beta-readers"" to provide feedback on the manuscript before it goes to print. This is a possible privilege, but not a guaranteed reward.
For the most part, each level includes all previous rewards, but there are some exceptions, so pay attention.
All backers will be listed in appreciation on jwashburn.com, where you’ll live forever for your generosity. Backers from the $55 reward on up will also be listed by name on the Acknowledgements page of the actual book (both ebook and print), so anyone reading SONG OF LOCKE will see your generosity. (Feel free to opt out or use your code name for these.)
STRETCH GOALS
I’m already close to finishing SONG OF LOCKE (which is why the funding goal may seem a little low). Your backer funds will primarily be spent on delivering the product (printing and shipping). The margin remaining after those costs will be used to pay for the typesetting and the cover illustration.
But I'm a dreamer, and there’s plenty of room to exceed the goal. After all, I have plans for a series:
SONG of LOCKE: The Dark Empyrean
Shilohe’s Song (a novella that tells the Goddess’s coinciding story)
SONG of LOCKE: The Seven Isles
SONG of LOCKE: The Revenant Sempiternal
If we reach $5,000, that unlocks Shilohe’s Song. I’ll send every backer the ebook of the Shilohe’s Song novella.
If we reach $20,000, that unlocks The Seven Isles. I’ll send every backer the Scroll 1 ebook of The Seven Isles (expect this in July 2015).
If we reach $35,000, that unlocks The Revenant Sempiternal. That means I’ll send every backer the FULL EBOOK of The Seven Isles, plus the Scroll 1 ebook of The Revenant Sempiternal (expect this in July 2016).
So share this Kickstarter with your amigos!
CALL ME INDIE
People ask me why I chose the indie route.
Being an indie is tough. But traditional publishing is tough too. Since both options were hard, I chose the more creative one. Now, instead of handing my completed stories to a corporation, I’m involved in the whole process—the writing, editing, typography, design, and publicizing. And I love it. I created the covers for all my previous books, and I designed the title typography for SONG OF LOCKE.
As far as style goes, I try to emulate the drama and pacing of Dan Brown, author of The DaVinci Code. I love how exciting his novels are, in spite of their being a tad formulaic. I like the short, punchy chapters, which make them easier to read. (As a kid, I never had a great attention span. Actually, I don't as an adult either.) I'm also a huge fan of Michael Crichton, author of Jurassic Park. His books are intelligent. His thorough research comes through in the details, and I always feel a little smarter after reading. And finally, I admire the depth of C.S. Lewis (my favorite of his is Out of the Silent Planet). Lewis gives you plenty to think about, even if he isn't particularly great with drama. I aspire to be a mix of these authors: exciting, smart, and profound. And I expect you'll find similar attributes in SONG OF LOCKE.

399,304570949,"Nasty Girls Vol 1 Regular Cover by Catriona Laird
Welcome to our Kickstarter for our new creator owned graphic novel series Nasty Girls!
PLAY

Nasty Girls is about a group of young women who are fed up with the way that people treat them, and women like them, and decide to do something about it. As the punk rock band Misfit Toys, they struggle to be heard, but as underground vigilantes, they really begin to make their mark.  
The title of the comic is a play on the phrase “nasty woman,” something that Hillary Clinton was called during the last US Presidential election, and which has come to be seen as a rallying cry for women’s rights. Nasty Girls is all about contemporary feminism, representation, and is our way of promoting social consciousness and embracing the authentic spirit of subversion and counterculture that is punk rock.
The Story
On stage, the Misfit Toys are just your average, ordinary rock band. Lexx sings like a rock and roll angel, Mercy is the queen of guitar riffs, Yun plays a mean bass, and Rana kicks ass on the drums. Sure, they're not particularly well known yet and no, they don't exactly have what you might call a fan base, but they do have instruments and write their own music! Everyone knows that's the hard part, anyway.
Misfit Toys Live
So yeah, everything was going just fine until those hecklers. And then the arrest. And the review in the newspaper, but really, how was Mercy supposed to respond? Ignore them? No way! That's how the patriarchy wins! And now they've got a bad reputation. Good thing they don't give a damn.
Mercy
Well, if people are going to call them nasty, these girls might as well prove them right.
Lexx
Meet the Band
Lexx
Lexx and Aubrey are sisters who couldn’t be less alike. Lexx is the lead singer of the band. She enjoys being in the spotlight and is more than willing to take a stand for what she believes, even when it’s difficult. She wants to do right by her friends and her little sister.
Sister power Aubrey and Lexx
Aubrey doesn’t quite have her sister’s confidence, so she prefers to play more of a supporting role, which is why she’s the roadie and driver for the Misfit Toys AKA Nasty Girls. She’s probably the most patient of the group, willing to wait and see what happens, rather than make any rash decisions.
Mercy
Mercy has been Lexx’s best friend since they were little kids and will pretty much back Lexx up no matter what. Mercy is the sort of person who will always look out for her friends, whether they need her to or not. She is stubborn and brave and is absolutely someone you do not want to make an enemy of.
Rana
Rana is the foundation of the group. She’s solid and dependable and is the one that everyone comes to when they need help. She’s got determination for days. Once she decides to do something, there is nothing that can change her mind or stop her from seeing it through.
Yun
Yun is basically the team mom. She really just wants to take care of everyone and make sure they’re drinking enough water and doing okay emotionally. Of all the girls, she’s probably the most tactful and diplomatic and is usually the one negotiating disagreements in the group and encouraging reconciliations.

401,1403895242,"Join Levi and Sarah as they embark on a whole new adventure filled with adventure, conspiracies and a splash of romance.
SYNOPSIS for Salvation
For Levi, turning eighteen used to be considered a right-of-passage; the day he’d transition into adulthood and his independence would take full bloom. That was the world before the Tradition and the First Born Law were created. Now turning eighteen for Levi simply means being Turned into what he hates most.
The faltering Sun has dawned a new age – a corrupt world where Vampires rule and no longer have to hide. The universe has cooled and with it, surface life on Earth has migrated beneath ground where humans and Vampires have learned to co-exist. But life isn’t without its challenges, something Levi learned early on as a small boy.
Levi is a First Born - property of the Council and scheduled to be Turned on his eighteenth birthday to join the Vampire cause.
Vampires are at the top of the chain - immortal beings who sometimes, along with their natural strengths, develop special enhanced abilities. But even they fear what awaits them on the desolate surface. A stronger, faster, mutated breed of Vampires have spawned from the fading Sun. The Vampeez. With fear and desperation as the driving force, the Tradition was set in place; an agreement between humans and Vampires where humans supply Vampires with fresh blood for the protection of their cities.
Levi’s life is all but simple. Not only does he believe he is a burden to his parents, the Council has always had a keen interest in him that he doesn’t understand. And being a First Born isn’t the privileged life it ought to be, as the Vampires he is forced to take orders from, rarely associate themselves with humans.
Being Turned is the last thing Levi wants. You awake one of two ways – lucky or unlucky. The lucky ones awake peacefully with their human memories intact; the unlucky ones experience violent episodes and awake with no memories of who they are or their former lives. With his eighteenth birthday only months away, Levi finds himself thrust into the immoral secrets of the Vampire world sooner than he is ready for when his girlfriend, Sarah, is Turned.
Sarah is a rare case. She is considered a lucky one, but wakes not remembering her family or the relationship her and Levi shared. To make matters worse, Chris, Sarah’s best Vampire friend, has taken the opportunity to wedge himself in between Levi’s efforts to help Sarah remember their relationship. When the Council promises her she can regain her memories through the Reborn Ritual, they seize the opportunity to begin their plans to eradicate the Vampeez. Or so it seems. They’re up to something, but in order for their plans to come full circle, they must rid themselves of Sarah and Levi. By secretly sending Sarah to meet an Ancient who can assist her in gaining her memories, Levi decides to follow, but is forced to endure Chris’s company.
But the Vampeez have their own weapon. A new Vampeez Queen has stepped up and has proven herself to be a formidable foe.
In the war between Vampeez, Vampires and humans, Levi, Sarah and Chris find themselves in the middle of a feud that started long before they were born, but discover that only they can change the outcome of the war."

THE STORY
Teacher's Lounge is an ensemble horror short film about a sadistic ritual new teachers must partake in on the first day of school.  It provides one possible answer to the lifelong question: What really goes on behind those closed lounge doors?
WHAT WE NEED AND WHY
This is an ambitious project.  The truth is, making movies isn't cheap.  The majority of it this one takes place in one room, but a lot of stuff happens in there.  There's a lot of logistics in play with a number of practical effects we will be doing, as well as balancing the dialogue and action of eight characters in our story.  So we're looking to our supporters to help us get this off the ground. We have a cast and crew of talented friends who are awesome enough to work on the project, taking time out of their busy schedules to help realize this passion project.  We will take any shortcut we possibly can, but some of the things we can't do that with are:
- Practical Effects.  We will be creating a series of puppets for a worm creature featured in the film.  There are also some blood/gore effects that will be happening as well.  Here's one of our concept designs.
Worm Concept Design by Matt Baehr
- Production Sound.  We will be hiring a trusted sound recorder along with their recording equipment.  We want to make sure we get really good audio so that the performances we capture on the day are what you get to see in the final film.  We want the recordings to do justice to the actors who will be giving it their all.
- Feeding the cast and crew.  Principal photography on the project will be 3 days.  There are eight people in the cast and at least that many on the crew.  There will be a lot of mouths to feed.
- Props and Art Direction.  We will be dressing our featured teacher's lounge location, and want to make it look as interesting and accurate as possible.
- Equipment rentals.  We have acquired a lot of equipment ourselves, but there are certain rigs and lights that we may have to rent.  Certain things would be LED lights and dolly equipment.
The less shortcuts we have to take, the easier it will be for us to focus on what's happening in the scene and the better film we will be able to make. If we exceed our goal, the same goes. The more we raise, the more luxury we will have to make every shot, every scene, and every detail as awesome as we imagined.

MIKHAIL BARYSHNIKOV on If the Dancer Dances —
""The dance studio is a private and mysterious place. After all, it’s where great works of choreography are created and kept alive. If the Dancer Dances grants us rare access, bringing us into the studio to watch the staging of a Merce Cunningham masterwork on the Stephen Petronio Company. It’s the tracking of this intimate process, a dance being passed, one body to another, that makes this film a great gift.""

The Story 
Hello! We would like to invite you into the intimate world of the dance studio, where a group of New York City’s top modern dancers breathe new life into a beautiful and mysterious work created 50 years ago. This is the story of our film, If the Dancer Dances, which was inspired by a conversation we began after the world-renowned Merce Cunningham Dance Company closed. Merce Cunningham was one of the greatest choreographers of the 20th century. The work he made changed the way we watch and think about dance. Merce died in 2009 at the age of 90 and his company closed soon after, leaving his fans around the world to mourn this tremendous loss. As a former member of the company, Lise took the closing in stride, saying everyone knew this was what Merce wanted. As an outsider, Maia found the decision dramatic and final. What happens to 60 years of pioneering work? Does it just vanish? 
You can go to a museum and see Picasso’s life’s work. But, there’s nowhere to go to experience the same for Cunningham, a choreographer who is arguably the Picasso of dance. 
Former Merce Cunningham Dance Company dancer Rashaun Mitchell and Stephen Petronio Company dancer Jaqlin Medlock rehearsing Merce Cunningham's RainForest
We discovered that most people had never thought about what it takes to keep a dance alive. We decided to make a film that would capture how dance is passed from body to body, one generation of dancers to the next. Luckily for us, one of our favorite modern dance companies—the Stephen Petronio Company—had just licensed the rights to re-create RainForest, one of Cunningham’s most enigmatic and breathtaking works, with décor by Andy Warhol, costumes by Jasper Johns, and live, electronic music by David Tudor. We jumped at the opportunity to film the re-creation from studio to stage, as three former members of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company pass the dance to the Petronio Company. 
Former Merce Cunningham Dance Company dancer Meg Harper and Stephen Petronio Company dancers Joshua Tuason and Nicholas Sciscione rehearsing Merce Cunningham's RainForest
The film is timed to coincide with Cunningham’s centenary, and we are eager for it to join the celebrations. However, we didn’t make this film with only dance lovers in mind. We wanted to invite everyone in—even those with no particular connection to dance. That’s why we’ve put the dancers at the heart of the film. We’re with them through their struggles and triumphs. In the end, this is a very human story. When the curtain comes down, we hope you feel connected to dance in a new and intimate way. 
We’ve finished shooting the film and are almost done editing. We now need funds to bring the film to completion. We are turning to you and the Kickstarter community to help us bring If the Dancer Dances to life. Please donate now—every amount helps. Thank you for supporting If the Dancer Dances.

 •Final editing 
•Music composition 
•Archival film rights 
•Title graphics 
•Sound design and mix
 •Color correction 
We are deeply grateful for your support and look forward to sharing If the Dancer Dances with you!

  Why support this particular film? 
Our goal in making this film is to give viewers a new entry point into the world of dance, to allow them to feel like insiders when watching and participating in dance. We all know from personal experience that the more we understand something, the more we can enjoy it. We just need the opportunity to become familiar, to explore. If the Dancer Dances offers this opportunity. It gives us intimate and rare access to how dances are made and kept alive. It demonstrates the extreme fragility of dance and, at the same time, the magnificence of something that exists only in the moment. The film does all this while underscoring the legacy of Merce Cunningham, one of the greatest artists of the 20th century, revealing what it takes to keep his groundbreaking work alive. 
Art brings beauty into our lives. Please help us bring the gift of dance to people everywhere.

About RainForest:
Choreographed in 1968, RainForest is a wild and mysterious work for six dancers, with shimmering, floating décor by Andy Warhol, shredded costumes by Jasper Johns and a live electronic score by David Tudor. The dance is typical of Cunningham’s collaborations with cutting-edge artists of his time, among them Robert Rauschenberg, John Cage and Bruce Nauman.

406,1445139804,"Update: hey! It looks like we reached goal #.5! 
Pinky 2020 bumper stickers will be a ""thingie"" 
A reminder about how Kickstarter works!
WE DID IT!!!!!!!!!!!
With 7 days to go,  WE HAVE REACHED OUR GOAL!!!!!!!! But why stop there? And so we announce our first Stretch Goal! (and a half!) See in the FAQ section ""What is a Stretch Goal?""
Stretch Goal #1/2: Hey! Wait just a gal-durn minute! You already have announced a stretch goal! What's with this HALF of a stretch goal????
Okay...well...um.... I REALLY REALLY REALLY want a Pinky Bumper sticker so I'm going to add a ""PRE-stretch goal"" Ha ha! So, if we get to $4200, everyone who has pledged at the Wu-Self Set level* and above, will get the Pinky 2020 Bumper Sticker. (*Or if you have pledged $46 or higher for any reward) EVERYONE will get a bumper sticker when we reach $4800 in total pledges. Does that make sense?
Stretch Goal #1A: if we reach $4800 in pledges, EVERYONE who pledges at the Patch level or above, will receive Pinky's 2020 cubpaign bumper sticker! (You KNEW Pinky would not be able to keep her paws off this cubpaign, right?)
""i told you, you should have voted for me!""
Have your way wif Wu!
I did my first Panda Chronicle pin project on a whim. Would anyone want enameled pins of the characters I draw every week? Turns out that you did! Huzzah! Now I, and a whole bunch of other folks, are walking around wearing Pinky, Bubba, and Ping Ping pins!
The first three pins!
Now, we are on the third pin and patch project, featuring the Real Mr. Wu and the Panda Kindergarten in their fabulous Fezmobile!
Was it fair to make the Wu Self wait for his big pin and patch debut?
When I did the previous project, I started small (Bubba's pin) and when the project funded in the first 3 hours, I added the Ping Ping pin and the Bubba and Friends patch. Let me tell you, it got really confusing! People adding more rewards, changing categories, changing pledge amounts.  Yikes! Way too confusing!
The Pin:
The real Wu Self! (complete with ear tape!)

The Keychain:
Don't let the Panda Kindergarten drive the car!


And last, but hardly least, the Wu the Pirate Patch:
Uh oh! Wu does not have paddles!
So, you might notice that there are multiple reward levels, and a higher goal that we need to reach before ANYTHING gets produced. But you guys sailed past this expanded goal amount within the first few days last time, so I have no doubt you will give it the old panda try this time too!
All the pins are enameled and covered with an epoxy coating, which gives them a little extra bling! They come to you on cards designed for each edition of the pins, adding a little extra pandy goodness to the presentation. The patches are made using a woven technique which provides intricate details in the final patch!
I DO have a couple of fun stretch goals in mind, but they will be things that I will add on for everyone who pledges at the pin level and above! Cool huh? Stay tuned and all will be revealed once we meet our goal!
Once again, you can always add on extra pins and Mr. Wu patches. Just check out the FAQs or message me for details on how to do that!
Bubba and his friends! Hands off Banky Pig, Pinky! These patches are only available through the sets listed in the reward section. No more Bubba & Friends patches are available as add ons."
407,1902183488,"We met our goal and we are now aiming for a stretch goal! 
If we're fortunate enough to exceed our goal, it will extend the film's ability to impact change.
If we raise $5k over our $40k goal, we can fund another trip for Beto Marubo of the Javari to attend screenings or global advocacy events. This allows us to connect even more deeply with audiences and continues to grow his leadership capabilities as an advocate for his people.
If we raise another $5k over this, we will apply it to our education initiative to continue speaking with classrooms around the world.

Have you heard? Damien Rice's beautiful music will be part of Tribes on the Edge! Here's an exclusive new clip of the song and the film. Please contribute to the campaign to help make the film happen!
When Beto of the Marúbo tribe in the Brazilian Amazon reached out to me and asked me to help tell his people’s story, I had no idea where the journey would lead. 8 years later, this independent documentary is almost complete. I am now asking for your help to finish the film and get us back to the Amazon for a strategy meeting with the tribes of the Vale do Javari to propose and define tangible initiatives that support their community.
More than a narrative of tribal reality in the Amazon, Tribes on the Edge suggests the universal story of our human tribe and how our future is interwoven with each other and with nature. This is a story that invokes the critical importance of respect and care – for land, culture, and humanity.
I first went to the Amazon with my grandfather Jacques Cousteau when I was 9 years old. 25 years later, I returned to film a documentary and as part of our filming, we attended a gathering of the Indigenous Peoples of the Vale do Javari in the Brazilian Amazon. I returned home from that expedition - but the stories and reality of the people I met were a constant presence. The list of challenges was long and overwhelming: hepatitis rates said to be close to 50-80%, high incidence and reoccurrence of malaria, illegal extractions on their ancestral land, a government decreasing funding for proper governance and protection of Indigenous territories. And in Javari, there is the largest concentration of vulnerable uncontacted tribes in the entire Amazon - at risk because of an encroaching developing world.
The indigenous people Vale do Javari help protect an ecosystem that produces 20% of the oxygen WE ALL breathe every day. The film allows us to share their story far and wide - but it is also a catalyst for advocacy and action. The accompanying impact campaign has three initiatives: education, advocacy, and activism. We have already started with some components of education and advocacy, but we need to keep going. We want to continue to give the people of Vale do Javari support beyond the film - setting in motion tangible actions guided and governed by the tribes themselves. And long after our camera crews are gone, these actions will be a source of support.
The survival of Javari is symbolic of the survival of each one of us. 
We live in a world threatened by global warming, fractured by crippling inequality and increasingly disconnected from each other and our environment. It is crucial we reconnect with people and land, that we awaken to the reality that we depend on each other, and understand that the Amazon and its inhabitants, as far away as they may feel, are crucial to our survival.
Indigenous people make up 4% of the earth’s population yet they protect 80% of its biodiversity on their ancestral lands. This biodiversity is the key to a healthy ecosystem and is an essential resource for the advancement of medicine, for us all.
In the Brazilian Amazon there is no deforestation on indigenous land - they are the guardians of an ecosystem that generates 20% of our global oxygen. WE ALL literally depend on the Amazon for our breath.
If you are concerned about the realities of global warming, the steady eradication of our indigenous cultures and the bureaucracy threatening human well-being, YOU can become a change-leader. This impact film not only tells a story to increase awareness, the impact campaign initiatives will directly benefit the tribes with projects determined and governed by them. 
Tribes on the Edge is more than 90% completed, thanks to the support of multiple funding organizations and in great part individuals. But we need that final support.
With your help, we can finish the film and meet with Vale do Javari tribal leaders and NGOs to create tangible actions that support the indigenous people of the Javari.
Here's where your support will be spent:
25%: Musical score- Kahlil Gibran once said ""Music is the language of the spirit. It opens the secret of life bringing peace, abolishing strife.” Our film's score is an essential component of our storytelling, tasked with imparting the themes of our story and bringing the audience into this important global issue. Our composer, Dean Grinsfelder has been nominated multiple times and received an Emmy, multiple Telly and Mobius Awards. But above that- he is pure talent and heart. A friend of the project, Dean has been adding the essential audible layer to the story.  
25% Animation- We have a few key sequences of the film where details must be imparted via animation. Céline's story in Amazon dates back to the late 80s when she was barely 9 years old. To capture and bring to life the eyes-wide open perspective of a child, we enlisted the talent of creative director Nick Cogan (ad campaigns such as Peanuts and Ice Age) to oversee the various animations; from maps, to character sketches, to the animation scene we need to finish: Céline as child in the jungle.
50%: Kickstart our activism initiative. We need to make one more trip to the Vale do Javari to define the activism initiative with the guidance of the Javari tribes and in collaboration with NGOs and support of partners. With your help, we can make that trip to the Amazon for the strategy meeting and ultimately create projects and tools the indigenous leaders have identified as most helpful for their peoples' empowerment and well-being.
The impact campaign has 3 initiatives: education, advocacy, and activism. We're thrilled to have already launched our education initiative reaching over 2,500 students around the world. The advocacy initiative will focus on communication through NGO partnerships, screenings, distribution, conferences, press opportunities, and other events.
We started filming with a small National Geographic grant, received funding in Brazil through a government grant, but we mainly made it to this point because of the incredible generosity of our individual funders. We truly did this as an indie doc. We are thankful to our gear supporters: LowePro, Goal Zero, Keen, Klean Kanteen, SteriPen, Fiilex, Geigerrig, Edelkrone, Kessler, Small HD, Clif Bar, Serengeti. 
We are aligning with non-profit organizations such as Amazon Watch and Tribal Link Foundation for various aspects of our impact campaign and will continue to grow this network. We will work closely with UNIVAJA, the representing organization for all the tribes of the Vale do Javari.
Tribes on the Edge is about reconnecting to the global human tribe and we understand that this includes a lot of different individuals and circumstances. This is why we hand selected rewards to cater to every budget, personality and lifestyle. 
With our rewards, getting access to Tribes on the Edge can be as easy as clicking a download link or as exciting as meeting Céline Cousteau for a dinner and screening. The fun part is…YOU get to decide.

En France, le port du masque dans les lieux publics clos est obligatoire depuis le 20 juillet.
Mais qu’y a t il derrière ces masques ? Voila la question que je me suis posé lors d’un voyage en train où nous étions tous masqués. Alors en voyant ces yeux est née l’envie de cette série de portraits d’anonymes encore plus anonymisés par leurs masques.

410,1810468486,"Thank you for watching and checking out my project!
I’m currently finishing up my third album, Gracia, which is by far my proudest project yet. For those of you familiar with my work, Gracia, is significantly different from my previous two albums, and is also very different from other contemporary Ladino albums out there.  Why?  Because half the album is original music I’ve written, in Ladino.
Very few contemporary artists are writing their own albums in Ladino today.  And as you can see from my video, sadly very few people even know what Ladino is!  My mantra is that “Ladino Rocks.”  Ladino is not a dead language at all; it is a living, breathing, beautiful language seeped in centuries of rich heritage and culture.  By writing new songs in Ladino that will hopefully reach a mainstream audience, I am doing my part to ensure that Ladino does not just get preserved from days of old, but continues to develop and grow today.  Your support will allow this to happen. 
The album’s title, “Gracia,” has several deep meanings for me, thanks being one of them.  The title itself pays homage to one of my heroes, Dona Gracia Mendes, a 15-century Sephardic woman who saved hundreds from the Spanish Inquisition. She is truly the main inspiration for me for this album—I admire her  courage, commitment to preserving culture, and her savvy use of feminism along the way.
To realize my vision for this album, I’ve joined forces with the incredible music producer and composer, Shai Bachar, who has worked with artists as varied as Ishtar Alabina, Omar Faruk Tekbilek, Sheila Jordan and Dudu Fisher, and has produced a platinum-record for Israeli superstar Ronit Shachar, wrote the original music for the Israeli Academy of Film best documentary film, Souvenirs (2007), and has scored countless commercials, PBS specials, and movies both in the US and in Israel.
Together with Shai, the songs on Gracia (both the original ones and a few radically reinterpreted classic tunes as well), are a mix of feminist, experimental, raw, rock-beat, energetic, empowering, electronic, retro-chic, Mediterranean-infused and fine-crafted, detailed sounds.  The album includes some of the finest musicians in New York, Israel, Morocco, Uruguay, Spain, Colombia, Russia and more.  I’m also featuring some guest voices and artists such as the incomparable Vanessa Hidary (the Hebrew Mamita), Amos Hoffman and Amir Bresler (Avishai Cohen band), Roni Ivrin and Mark Kakon (Idan Raichel Band), Nir Graf (Noa, Rita, Shalom Hanoch), Oz Noy (Cyndi Lauper, Phoebe Snow, Bill Evans), Samuel Torres (Lila Downs, Arturo Sandoval) and even a cameo by feminist icon, Gloria Steinem. 
In order to make this project come to fruition (with a goal to release it in spring 2012), I need to raise $12,000 in the next 60 days.  This is actually  only a quarter of what I need to ensure the quality that this album deserves.  Between studio rentals in Tel Aviv and New York, world-class musicians (including a 16-piece string orchestra!) mixing and mastering, this is what it takes to create a Do-it-Yourself (DIY) album in today’s music world.  As the music industry changes, independent artists like myself can no longer turn to record labels to help put forth our music.  We are left to self-fund, record, market and distribute our music all on our own.
So that's where Kickstarter comes in.  It’s basic crowd-funding:  give your pledge now, and you will only get charged in 60 days if the complete amount I’m requesting gets raised.  If I don’t raise the full amount in time, you don’t get charged (and the album doesn’t get released). And I don’t have to stop at $12,000.  That’s just my minimum goal to get the CD through mixing and mastering.  But there’s still a long way to go to get the CD packaged and into your hands.  I can always raise more (and in fact, need to…), so just because you think I’m nearing my goal, please don’t let that stop you from being a part. Plus there are rewards for everyone who contributes, at any level!
I’ve already come so far.  You, my friends and fans, have the power to ensure that this music gets out into the music marketplace. I believe so strongly not only in this album (which is by far my best musical expression and product yet), but also in the importance and power of preserving cultural treasures, like Ladino, in new ways that will challenge and inspire. 
Thank you, or in Ladino, munchas gracias, for taking the time to read and watch. And thank you many times over if you contribute even a tiny bit…all of it will make a difference!
Yours,
Sarah

411,671012841,"The Underground is a book written by Brianna Cole. The story is a post-apocalyptic cyberpunk fantasy exploring the uprising of prisoners against the nobility of the fictional city of Aeralia.
The Synopsis
Years ago in the 2020s there were many great continents containing countries of varying power. The Americas, Europe, Africa, Asia, Antarctica, Australia. But during the space race, wars occurred, causing mass destruction and failing infrastructure. The internet fell and chaos ensued.
After war, famine and restructuralization, a man named Leon Amakha lead The Reconstruction. He formalized Aeralia and with the assistance of the best and brightest remaining from the fallen countries, established Aeralian rule. Amakha was a scientist and visionary, who wanted peace and strength through a re-invisioned medieval class system, of which he admired. However, over the years his doctrine has been skewed through selfishness and greed. The Underground was not his vision.
Yoruemi is one of many, trapped in the subterranean Aeralian prison aptly titled The Underground. But there is more to Aeralia and The Underground than rich nobility and criminals. And there is more to Yoruemi’s purpose than being a street rat. An orphan. A pickpocket. She is the key. An uprising is coming.
Rewards options include a handwritten letter from the author, a custom bookmark, and or early and signed copies of the book!"

BIO
I am a guitarist and Native American flutist from Niagara Falls, NY, in the Western New York region, just outside Buffalo, and 60 min from Toronto Canada. I have had the good fortune of performing with several very talented artists over the years, especially in the Native American Music community. I have also been given the opportunity to compile a group to function as the House Band for the Annual Native American Music Awards show for the last couple years, where my band and I have performed on stage with the likes of: Rock & Roll Hall of Fame member and Ventures Guitarist Nokie Edwards, Grammy Winning '70s Disco Icon Janice Marie Johnson from the group Taste of Honey, and Grammy winning Native American Musical Icon Joanne Shenandoah, along with many other great musicians. While I have been performing for a couple decades now, I have in the last few years been continuously asked if I have a CD of my own music at shows that I have played. My reply is always, ""not at the moment but I am working on it"" with the sincere hope that I will indeed have a CD to offer in the future. The obstacle to delivering on that has always been funding. I always thought it was vital, that if I was going to record, that I put out a top notch product, but to do that it takes capital. When I looked into Kickstarter, it seemed like a great way to achieve my goal.
The Music
First thing is the music. The music that I'd like to record is, what I feel, something a little different, but not so unfamiliar. What I've been doing in live performances is incorporate the Native American flute into more contemporary styles, such as, Blues, Rock, Jazz, even Reggae, without losing the Nuance that makes the Native flute such a striking sound in it's traditional format. The Native Flute is an instrument that stands alone incredibly well. It also works well with accompaniment ranging from piano and acoustic guitar, to full bands and orchestras.There are some incredible Native Flutists that make stunning music using the flute as the focal point of the music. Where I am trying to break new ground is using the flute in new ways, along with its traditional placement in the music, I want to place it where it is not normally used, in ways that are new, different and non-traditional, such as experimenting with different effects that aren't readily associated with the Native flute. Take it places it isn't normally found. The music will be mostly original music, written by myself in collaboration with the members of my band. We have the songs, we have the vision, we just need to produce the product. It is my hope that you would be kind enough join us. Here is a little sample of the band performing our version of Jimi Hendrix's Little Wing. We've put a reggae groove behind it, and you can hear how the Native Flute brings a brand new voice to an all time classic.
The Studio
The studio that will be used is GCR Recording Studios in Buffalo NY. It is a world class studio owned by Buffalo Native Robby Takac of the Goo Goo Dolls. I chose this studio for a couple reasons:
The live room in the studio has one of the best vibes for recording anywhere.
 The equipment is state of the art, the engineering and production staff are world class experts.
The studio, via Robby and his Music is Art foundation, does countless things for the youth and artists in the community, I think its important to support them, allowing their efforts to continue. More on Music is Art follow this link: http://www.musicisart.org/

The Musicians
 I will be using the musicians that I hire for my live performances. They are amazing, world class musicians. Their input and abilities have been, and will be, an important part of the process. They are great musicians who play with countless artists. I'm honored and grateful for they willingness to bring this project to conclusion.
For an example of the Ed Koban Group, please view the video below of a performance in our role as house band at the Native American Music Awards, we are backing up award winning Native American artist Gary Small. I added this video as it showcases the members of the band.
I don't have support from a record label. I pledge to raise $3,300 USD so I can release my First CD. 100% of the funds will go towards producing, mixing, mastering and distributing my CD. Art design for the CD cover and poster. Hiring musicians, marketing and promoting my music.
So please join me on my journey by pledging your support and in return you will receive some exclusive and unique packages related to my release! It is just as important to Facebook, Tweet, email and tell everyone you know about this project! This is a really exciting time for me and I can't wait to share this all with you!"

For the better part of 2019 I've been working diligently with my team on a new system  for eliminating layovers.  I am very excited about the potential benefits of what we have been working on.  I even took the important step of patenting the system and method that would enable those layovers to be eliminated.
We built the company that can move this idea to full implementation, and we can coordinate all of the players needed to make the system work.  We also have a powerful database which can sort through the millions of itineraries with layovers to find the matches which will allow some of those layovers to be eliminated.
How many layovers will be eliminated with this system?  It is hard to know the exact amount. It could be hundreds per a day or even thousands per day.  But no matter how many it is, there is no doubt that it will be something useful and appreciated for the travelers that are able to take advantage it.

416,1112434533,"Our world is moving at an astonishing speed. In the past two centuries, humanity has countered almost every deadly infectious disease, engineered a vast food supply chain and thwarted almost every attempt by nature to curtail our skyrocketing population. Yet, despite all the good we’ve done to improve man’s life on Earth, the damage we’ve done to the planet is becoming more and more apparent everyday.
Today, humanity’s demand for resources vastly exceeds nature’s ability to supply them. Food, water, climate and extinction emergencies are unfolding before our eyes. 8 Billion Angels dares to tell the truth about the conflict between our population and the sustainability of our planet. It dispels the myth that technology can save us, that reducing consumption is possible and that the problem lies solely in the developing world.
8 Billion Angels addresses overpopulation honestly and compassionately. By clearly depicting the problem and empowering the audience to take actions that can start to heal the planet, we can give humanity the best chance of living in a more just, peaceful and sustainable world.
Poster Design by Chris Davidson
Overpopulation is always in the news but is never named. It impacts all of us, from the loss of green space to urban sprawl, from gridlocked traffic to beaches strewn with plastic or closed due to water pollution. 
Overpopulation is the single fundamental upstream cause of every environmental crisis and many social injustices. By addressing overpopulation responsibly, compassionately, and humanely, we hope to inspire others, including members of the environmental community, press and government, to address the affect of family size, women's education and healthcare and family planning on the health of our planet. If we are successful in that paradigm shift, we can reverse the damage we have done to our natural world more effectively than all other ""green"" solutions combined.

8 Billion Angels makes the issue of overpopulation understandable and relatable. By bringing a narrative style to this genre of documentary, we intend to expand the audience for its message well-beyond the typical environmental movie devotee. 8 Billion Angels connects with the audience by focusing on human emotions instead of solely on scientific facts. We convey beauty and hope through images, even when covering a serious subject. The film tells the stories of individuals around the world, painting a tableau of the larger issue of overpopulation. We follow our mosaic of characters as they tell us, on a personal level, about the impact of overpopulation on their lives. By showing our characters as they go about their day-to-day routines, the same ones we all perform, the audience feels a shared connection. Ultimately, 8 Billion Angels shows that the larger issue of overpopulation is really a diverse collection of many individual experiences.  
8 Billion Angels was created to inspire international dialogue and provoke action about population's role in our global humanitarian and environmental crises. 
To do this, it outlines 4 key action steps: supporting organizations that improve women's access to family planning and education; adopting measures to reduce our global carbon emissions, promoting a small family ethic among all people; and advocating for governmental policies that slow and reverse population growth. 
By partnering with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) with a track record of advocating for these initiatives and addressing them directly ""on the ground"" the film will inspire programming that will help students, community activists, business leaders, and government representatives learn about ecological overshoot and direct them to a path leading to a more sustainable, peaceful and prosperous future.
We have covered our production costs and have completed the filming. We are now in post-production and in our last phase of funding to finish the film and make sure it is seen. 
We've established a variety of tiers for fundraising for post-production. We don't want to put all of our eggs in one basket (it would be overpopulated anyways!). We need to complete a first edit of the film regardless, beyond that, we've created separate tiers of fundraising as stretch goals to supplement any additional fundraising we'll need to do. Once we know we can edit the film, we'll hone in on other professional services and distribution. However, that can't be done if we don't hit our initial goal.
Our Post-Production Budget:
At 34,000, we'll be able to professionally cut together the months of footage we have, and have something to show for it.
At 61,600, we'll be able to fully mix and master all of our sound and our original score. Sound is incredible important for the experience of watching a film, and we can't have a finished product without it.
at 84,200, we'll be able to finalize our visual effects and color grading to make 8 Billion Angels look and feel like every other cinematic environmental documentary. It will fit in along the most venerable films in this topic.
at 154,700, we'll use these final funds to make sure this film is shown, anywhere and everywhere, to anyone, to everyone. This film needs to travel to film festivals so dedicated film-going audiences know the stakes. Beyond that, we'll need to negogiate distribution with streaming services and other exhibition formats. At this level, we're confidant people will see this film no matter where they are.
To show our appreciation for your contribution, and our dedication to environmentally conscious production, we have curated a selection of sustainable rewards in gratitude for helping us finish this film.
You can check out all of our rewards in the column to the right, but here are a few images for you to consider.

Seit 1992 organisiert die Augsburger FedCon GmbH populäre Conventions wie die MagicCon (www.magiccon.de) für Fantasy-Fans oder die FedCon (www.fedcon.de), die jedes Jahr Tausende von Science-Fiction-Begeisterten ins Maritim Hotel nach Bonn lockt.
Im Jahr 2020 wäre die FedCon bereits in die 29ste Runde gegangen, doch die Corona-Pandemie war schließlich der Grund dafür, die Convention nun vom 21.05. – 23.05.2021 zu präsentieren. Nachdem auch die MagicCon verschoben werden musste (jetzt 15.10. – 17.10.2021), steht die FedCon GmbH als Eventveranstalter vor einer gigantischen finanziellen Herausforderung.
Doch im Zeichen der Krise entstanden in den letzten Wochen eine Reihe schöner Ideen, wie diese schwere Zeit besser überstanden werden kann.  Viele Anregungen kamen dabei auch durch unsere Conbesucher, die immer wieder ihre aktive Unterstützung anbieten. Für diesen überwältigenden Zuspruch unserer Community sind wir sehr dankbar.
Wir freuen uns daher, mit dem FedCon Events-Fotoband „Stars im Fokus“ ein weiteres ambitioniertes Kickstarter-Projekt ankündigen zu können. Auf insgesamt über 200 Seiten präsentieren unsere professionellen Event-Fotografen Rafael Cantero, Daniel Dornhöfer und sichtlichmensch beeindruckende Starporträts vieler Gäste von FedCon und MagicCon. Das Hardcover-Buch wird im „Coffee Table Book“-Format (ca. 30 x 30 cm) produziert werden und stellt neben den Porträts auch die drei Künstler vor.
Einen ersten Eindruck zum FedCon Events-Fotoband „Stars im Fokus“ vermittelt der Videoclip, der erneut von unserer Nessi in Szene gesetzt wurde. Natürlich gibt es wieder mehrere Optionen, dieses Kickstarter-Projekt zu unterstützen. Eine Möglichkeit ist, sich namentlich als Förderer im Buch verewigen zu lassen. Oder wie wäre es z. B. mit dem „VIP-Paket“, bei dem man am Vorabend der MagicCon oder FedCon 2021 (jeweils Donnerstagabend) an einem Galadinner im  Maritim Hotel teilnehmen kann in Anwesenheit von einigen Stars.
Um auch unser zweites Projekt, den FedCon Events-Fotoband „Stars im Fokus“, Wirklichkeit werden zu lassen, zählen wir jetzt auf deine Unterstützung dieser Kickstarter-Aktion.
Vier Wochen lang hast du nun die Möglichkeit, die Finanzierung dieser aufwendigen Buchproduktion mit zu sichern und gleichzeitig einen wertvollen Beitrag dafür zu leisten, dass dir die FedCon GmbH auch in Zukunft Fan-Events wie MagicCon oder FedCon präsentieren kann.
Dafür im Voraus ein dickes DANKESCHÖN von deinem Team der FedCon GmbH"
418,147077736," ""Museum grade deep space artworks that are beautifully vibrant and glow in the mf dark!
Update - new stretch goal unlocked
WOW, Huge thanks to everyone for the incredible support so far we've unlocked another stretch goal!!!!!! More information further down the page! 
Hey You! (yes... you) 
Isn't space just incredibly beautiful?
I'm Cat, and three years ago I quit my day job and taught myself how to paint so I could share the universe in the most beautiful way possible... 
...by making galaxies that GLOW in the dark. :)
When we tried to make these prints, we uncovered a huge issue...
Every printing company we approached said the special type of fine-art printing we wanted to do was *impossible* to print with glow. 
So we did what we do best... We invented our own printing technology to make it happen!
After years of development I'm so excited to announce our Latest Groundbreaking Development...
""Ultra-glow print technology"" Now twice as bright as our earlier prints - you can enjoy artwork printed to fine-art standards in the day... and experience the them glowing at night for up to 8+ hours.
Our new process allows us to use up to FIVE glow layers! It outshines anything we've ever created before. Not only that but its far quicker too meaning deliveries will happen even sooner.
DON'T WORRY - you don't need to pick right now - selections are made at the end
Update - New Stretch goal added, Cosmic Embrace. 
For the Canvas and Paper prints, you can choose from any of the 10+ designs to have printed in stunning glow in the dark. 
For the Mural Prints there is only one beautiful design - the milky way galaxy.
You get to choose exactly which designs the paper and canvas prints are.  The Selections are made once the campaign ends via a survey you'll receive.
 Designs - You can pick from 10+ designs for the canvas and paper prints, for the murals there is only one design.
 Charging - The glow can be charged by any source of light, UV and daylight is best, but normal bulbs also work too, LED is less effective than other types.
 Glow Time - Once they are charged they can glow up to 8 hours, The first hour is brightest and it slowly dims over the night. 
 Glow Colour - The glow on the canvas and paper prints is a light green yellow (this is the brightest and lasts the longest), the murals are printed with multiple colours of glow including blues, turquoise, and green/yellow. 
 Longevity - The glow pigment is expected to continue working for over two decades. In an archival setting the colour pigments should last for 80-100 years. The more UV exposure the fewer years it will glow for and the sooner the colour will fade.
 Framing - The paper prints can be framed behind a glass frame. The canvas prints should be stretched around a wooden frame using a gallery wrap. The murals don't need framing, you just stick them up on the ceiling
 Applying Murals - It's literally peel off the backing and stick it up. Its ridiculously simple. They are specially designed to never get air bubbles with no special tools required. The surface you're applying it to must be smooth and Teflon free.
 Moving Murals - They can be peeled off and re-stuck multiple times - I tested re-positioning after 6 months and it worked fine - if you need to move them, just remember to peel slowly, and save the backing paper so the glue dots don't get dirty when you're moving.
 Shipping - Everything is delivered rolled in a tube to keep them safe in transport. Nice and Easy :D 
 Large Paper prints are (500mm x 707 mm | 19.7"" x 27.8"")
The Extra Large Canvas Prints are  (1210mm x 855 mm | 47.6"" x 33.6"")
The Extra Extra Large Murals are  (7.8ft long x 25.5in wide | 2.4m long x 65cm Wide)
 ✔   Incredible Glow - Ultra Glow Technology, our brightest glow-in-the-dark prints yet. 
Why is this important?-  Normal Glow inks are very dim, so other glow in the dark pictures don't glow brightly. Our method allows us to layer the pigments over and over so they glow far brighter.
✔   Museum Quality - Printed on archival FSC certified opalescent paper milled in Italy.
Why is this important? -  Fading prints are a collectors worst nightmare. Almost all cheap papers and canvases contain Acid &  Brightening Agents and these make your precious artwork fade. We've ensured that all of our stock is archival this means your investments last a lifetime, they don't contain these harsh chemicals and we also source our paper from a responsibly managed forest.
✔   Rare Collectables - Authenticity Certificate, Limited edition embossed & numbered.
Why is this important? -  Scarcity is really important when it comes to the value of collecting artwork. Every print is verified as authentic with special marks, and you can see how many prints are ever produced. 
Whilst I could make loads of money selling the same designs for years and years, ensuring you have a solid investment is more important to me. Therefore designs are only ever sold for one calendar year and after that, they are never available again as limited edition prints.
Lets impact the lives of those outside of our project
Every year we put any surplus funds into a bigger art project to benefit the lives of people outside of Kickstarter.
This time, we're building a galaxy chandelier of the milky way, 3D printed in crystal clear resin and suspended from thousands of fibre optic threads. 
Oh and it'll be 26ft / 8m in diameter
Built using data from the European Space Agencies GAIA Mission, I've already been fortunate to have several meetings with data scientist and people who worked on the mission as well as 3D printing companies and our development is underway. 
It will be the largest physical model of our galaxy and it'll give everyone who sees it, the unique opportunity to connect with our beautiful home - the Milky way. 
I calculated it'll cost around 250k to build, so I'll be funding it's production over several projects. So it's not going to be a deliverable for this project but I'm going to be taking you all on the adventure with me :) 
The best part - Once built, we'll be giving it away... for free... to Museum or Art Gallery. 
PLAY

419,1098306436,"The idea behind Utilo began while Brian was working alongside his former partner in his previous startup in March of 2017. They were working on a project that connected liquor retailers to their consumers based on geolocation targeting. 
As they ran into more issues and problems, they continuously messaged friends who they knew that had startups or knew about subjects they didn't. Brian quickly realized a huge problem they were facing, although they were actively networking with the contacts and popular social and professional platforms they had, they simply did not have enough access to contacts or personalized information at scale.  
So, Brian's partner in his first startup reached out to one of his friend's who worked in a WeWork office space in NYC. He asked if the friend could post their question in the WeWork app platform to see if we could get any help with the problem we were struggling with at the time. For those who don't know, WeWork offers a platform that connects those in their given office space so that they have the ability to reach out to one another. Within about 5-10 minutes, we had received 4 messages from people who were willing to help. It was shocking but intriguing at the same time. Brian then began to think about why services such as these are so limited, selective, and pricey. This is where the idea for Utilo started.  
After thinking more and more about how this model could be implemented at scale without discriminating against a massive population based on limited accessibility options and price, the complete idea finally came. From this point on, Brian then began working on Utilo full-time in order to completely develop the model. Utilo eventually became what it is today, which is a professional networking platform that allows users to share knowledge, ideas, expertise, and network with users from locations of the individual's choosing.  
Oh, and just to clarify, 'Utilo' translates to 'Useful'.  
We are now ready to begin raising funds to start the project. We believe that Utilo has the ability to disrupt two massive markets, professional networking and knowledge sharing, and create an uncontested market space due to our unique features as well as our mission of providing users with the highest amount of value and opportunity needed to scale their businesses and careers. But, we need your help to get started. We are raising the $6,000 to develop the web app as well as launch a successful beta that you have the unique opportunity to be a part of!  
Insight into Utilo and it's abilities:  
Free Subscription Abilities:  
1.) Ability to interact with two different locational settings (university as long as you are at or near a university) and regional, as well as a main delocalized feed, called 'Utilo Hub', that all Utilo members can access  
2.) Ability to connect with and follow other users  
3.) Ability to direct message other users on the platform that you follow, as long as they follow you back  
4.) Ability to access a 'Discover' feature that suggests possible connections nearby based on the locational setting you've selected, as well as details for events near you  
5.) Ability to upvote and downvote posts  
6.) Ability to achieve a 'Top Contributor' tag that reflects a high engagement rate and high amount of upvotes on each of your posts or responses  
7.) And MUCH more!  
Premium Subscription Abilities:  
1.) All free access abilities  
2.) Ability to select the location of your choosing, regardless of where your their current location actually is. This allows you to have full access to any location, ex: Select 'Greater New York City area' as your current location even if your actual current location is in the 'Greater Chicago area'  
3.) Enhanced search abilities (more search filters, more shown profiles, etc.)
4.) Ability to direct message individuals who do not follow you back in a separate messaging feature  
5.) Ability to see who has viewed your profile  
6.) And MUCH more!
Stretch Goals for the project:  
$10,000 - Hire a UI designer to help perfect the platform 
$15,000  - Fully implement all Utilo features into the platform
$25,000 - iOS and Android platform development
$50,000 - Host the first Utilo networking event in the city of YOUR choice! "

421,517616308,"Hello,
Simpliccity is a multi-site project that I have been working on since October of 2017 that is essentially centered around our users. Throughout the course of 2018, we hope to publish several sites with our first being Simpliccity Write, a social media site already in the works for bloggers with tons of amazing features. We are able to provide such features with the help of other developers who we have acquired the phenomenal products of that tie into the design and functionality of our websites.
Write will be available as a beta soon, as an idea of what to expect.
We are on kickstarter asking for the amount of $5,000 so that we can continue to build upon what we have and continue to grow. The websites cannot and will not be published without your help and support. Our backers play one of the most significant roles in the development of these sites.
Our goal is to excel in ways that interests you and essentially motivates you, inspires you, to do and be more. Our users will make up all of what Simpliccity should and does stand for, the reason for Simpliccity itself being named Simpliccity. The two Cs, which you may or may have not assumed to be a spelling mistake, stands for a Creative Community, one that we hope you can contribute to, not only with a small donation but by joining us now and when we go live on February 25th.
At that time I hope that you and many others can appreciate the amount of work and dedication that has gone into constructing and publishing this and many other websites that are apart of Simpliccity. This year will define our success, yet we will always be dedicated to excelling and going further for no one but you, our user.
Thanks,

422,1890459512,"The Wonderings art book has been completely designed and is ready to send through to the printers as soon as it has been funded.
To ensure the highest quality we will be trusting our previous printers who looked after The Guidebook and 2014 sketchbook.
The book will be offset printed (hell yes!) and will feature a 300gsm Soft cover with matt laminate and a stunning spot gloss feature finish.
The book will be 'perfect bound', which is a combination of stitching and glue, this will give the spine better stability and the book better strength. Basically, we tried it once on the 2014 sketchbook and just never looked back! This binding style is the best for soft covers.
For those of you who know the original Guidebook from Nightmare's and Vision's, this book will be the same size 18.5 cm x 26 cm (this is just a bit smaller than A4.) 

Wonderings will be my biggest sketchbook EVER! I had so many sketches we actually had to choose the best pages for this book.

423,754158571,"From all it's famous history and stories that have been told through the years, people from all around the world have had their eye on 'Main Street of America.' I am no exception. After almost four years, this July 2019, I'm finally able and going to travel the entire length of Route 66. So, besides traveling the route, what would be the next best thing for you? How about putting together a picture book of my journey to share with you and anyone else who wishes to come along? 
   This Kick Starter campaign is just for that, a chronicle of my adventure: 'The Mother Road.' It will feature a collection of my own, unique, captioned images and story articles I've gathered from my trip. Each book will be $30 to produce.
   Hello, my name is Michael Gault. I’m a photographer, adventurer, and Youtuber who likes to just go and travel to places on a mere whim. This road trip will start from Chicago, Illinois, and end at Santa Monica Pier, California. I will travel Route 66 as much as possible... this means a bit of off-roading, hiking to great scenic spots and camping beneath the stars in most areas. I have researched, for years, for my time with this iconic road and it is time to experience it! That said, my approach to this trip is about the experience and not about time. I've planned and budgeted for a three-week trip but don't be surprised if I stay out even longer. When I get this kind of itch, I scratch to fulfillment... 
   In addition to taking along my digital and film cameras, I'm also bringing along my drone and my vlogging equipment. There will be frequent uploads to my YouTube channel detailing my progress for you to support and follow :)
   Why support me when it's been done so many times? Because Route 66 is rapidly changing, no person's trip is the same as another. Travelers of the route approach it with their own perspectives and express their own takeaways from it. All have their own unique approach, style, and level of photography. Me, I'm very good at photography and often push myself through my boundaries... being comfortable with just an 'okay' photograph is just not my style. Only the best of my best can be expected to be featured in my book. 

Books will be shipped out the second week of September. Every backer's name, state, and country will be acknowledged and every book will be signed by me. This will be a limited run. I'm only going to print 150 books for this project... and each will be numbered. 
Prints of images will be available for purchase on my website after books ship."

425,1068815369,"How it started
In 2009, I quit my architecture career in the Netherlands and moved to Vietnam to study water and climate challenges in the Mekong delta. A few years later, I published my book Living with the Mekong. Vietnamese readers were enthusiastic and told me there was so much more to explore. They asked me to make a documentary about their lives, challenges and resilience.
I decided to do it and Me and Mekong was born: an interactive documentary to raise awareness and support for change by showing everyday climate and water challenges through the eyes of local people. My ultimate goal is to give hope and offer a new future to children and their families who live with water. They are the first and hardest hit by climate change. Though, during my journeys through the Mekong delta I also discovered that it is not all doom and gloom. I got impressed by the local resilience and innovation power of farmers, fisher(wo)men and young entrepreneurs. In Me and Mekong I want to show both: the hardships and local answers to climate change.
I asked Vietnamese researcher Long Hoang from Wageningen University to join hands. He is dedicated to work towards positive change for local communities in the Mekong delta. My Nextblue colleagues were enthusiastic and documentary photographer Thomas van den Berg completed our team.
We shared our film plan with Henk Ovink, Dutch Envoy for International Water Affairs. He immediately agreed that now is the right time and that he is 100% committed to support our project. He endorses our fundraising campaign. Will you join us?
Please pledge any amount you can and give local communities a voice in tackling climate change. Every contribution or share helps.

What is this film about?
We need your help to put a human face on climate and water challenges in one of the world's most vulnerable regions: the Mekong delta in Vietnam.
Each year, increasingly intense weather events and floods cause fatalities and damage to infrastructure. The livelihoods of poor communities are especially affected by these natural disasters. Their schools get flooded, bamboo houses are washed away, and agricultural land becomes infertile. We want to make an interactive, web documentary to show living with water in a changing delta through the eyes of these people.
Me and Mekong is a solution-driven film made with and for local people in the Mekong delta. It portrays five citizens who act now to strengthen their resilience to climate change. They take you on a virtual journey through their delta while showing you a wide range of issues, from salinisation and subsidence to flooded streets and mangrove restoration. You'll discover unique local perspectives on climate change adaptation.
Join us. Together we'll increase the pressure on politicians and companies to act now.
Together we can build a better future for Vietnam's Mekong delta!
*****
We are looking for €10,000 to cover production costs. Me and Mekong is a locally-driven film. The budget includes reservations to actively involve local partners in the script development and film shooting. Furthermore, we don’t want this to be a one-off initiative. Therefore, we will facilitate a workshop and train young people with a smartphone to make their own videos. By doing so, we will build a community of local climate and water journalists with whom we will continue working beyond completion of the documentary. 
Dutch Water Envoy Henk Ovink is one of the ambassadors for our campaign.

Narrative
Your journey begins in Chau Doc, which is located in the northern part of the Mekong delta, a couple of hours west from Ho Chi Minh City. You travel from there down the Mekong river and visit five different locations and people who show their daily life, including footage from their activities, in house and outside.
Map of the Mekong delta with five fictional characters.
Language
Narrations and voice-overs are used to guide the story. The documentary will be available in Vietnamese, English and Dutch. Dialogues are in Vietnamese, taking the viewer deeper into the world of the Mekong delta and its people.
Filming conditions
We go for an authentic documentary style. This means we will use natural lighting as much as possible to achieve a genuine look and feel. In addition to the main film, which will be in digital HD format, we will invite local people to submit their own home-video style footage. We will also train local people on making good quality videos with their smartphones.
Screening
The documentary will be launched in the Netherlands and Vietnam. After the launch, Me and Mekong will be freely available online. As a crowdfunder you will get access to exclusive imagery of the making off.

Having a professionally recorded and packaged demo will provide a quality representation of Family Dynamic that we can use to promote our music. We hope to create a demo that will warrant a new experience with every listen. 
With the funds we will create a demo cd with 3-4 original songs. It will be professionally recorded and produced. We will then professionally package a limited number of physical copies of the demo. Digital copies of the demo will be available as well via iTunes. With our demo, we will have a professionally crafted body of songs that we can use to represent our band. We will use the demo to gain noteriety, send to record labels, and more.

427,1329507595," Welcome to our Kickstarter for the documentary, ""The Twotakes - Hit or Bust."" We are a small crew looking to make something big! 
Story Synopsis:
The Twotakes is a documentary about four young adults who have different responsibilities but share one common passion, music. Giovanni Turra and Josh Riccio are full-time students at Savannah College of Art and Design, whereas Chase Brown and Beau Anderson work in construction and at a fencing company. During the day, these four young men are so busy with their jobs and entering adulthood, that they hardly have time for themselves let alone a band. Nevertheless, when the sun goes down and they clock out of work, Gio, Josh, Chase, and Beau put their daytime worries aside, pack their gear up into an old van and drive off to play a show. After hours of driving, they arrive at a bar that changes everything. Everyone armors up with their instruments. Gio and Beau with their guitars, Josh with his drums, and Chase with his bass. The stage-lights shine bright as fans from all over, cheer at the top of their lungs. The curtains draw back, revealing the indie rock band, The Twotakes. In this documentary, we will dive deep into the band showing intimate moments as they work hard to manage the daily grind and struggle of their nine-to-five's, sacrifice desires for a stable future, solving the conflicts within the band, and going through personal struggles. Throughout this documentary, the audience will be able to learn more about the Twotakes as regular guys, as opposed to the characters they put on for the stage. Will the band be able to overcome their individual responsibilities, while pursuing music and fulfilling their dreams?

We all have busy lives. Most of us don't have the time to cook healthy, delicious meals. We can't always eat out either. For years, our only option was to order take-outs and fast foods, but that needs to change with more and more people focused on healthier diets and lifestyles as well. That's where KHABAY comes in. It's our solution to having meals upon demand literally at our fingertips. This project is based on the ""shared economy"" concept. If you believe in shared economy, please contribute to this project. Here's the demo website http://www.khabay.com/. It can be best viewed on your desktop for the moment.

430,122712407,"  Geraldo Olivo and Robert Cortez, Tranquilo Way Productions
Tranquilo Way was founded in 2015 by producer Geraldo Olivo, director Robert Cortez and photographer Alfredo Cortez as a way to produce short films and tell stories that they weren’t seeing anywhere else. Since then, we’ve worked with talented cast and crews on films for the 48 Hour Film Race and The Zone Film Race, as well as our own entries for 100 Hour Film Race (“Missed”) and CineSpace film competition (“Signs of Life”) which you can watch at www.tranquiloway.com/films/.
Stills from ""Missed"" (2015)
  Stills from ""Signs of Life"" (2016)
 But that was all just the beginning. We’re taking our skills and vision to the next level with the help of Dave Cebrero (co-founder of the Houston Latino Film Festival) as our cinematographer and an eclectic cast from theater, comedy and modeling backgrounds, including Jonathan Gonzalez, Nicolai Mitchell, Jose Gonzalez and Kelli Ham.
The cast of Visitors Only: Jonathan Gonzalez, Nicolai Mitchell, Jose Gonzalez, Kelli Ham
Add to that a film crew of skilled artists and filmmakers, and we’ve got a potent team ready to tackle this production.
Getting lost in a parking garage isn’t as hard as you might think. Take a one of those concrete mazes late at night, add two oblivious businessmen from out of town, send in a beautiful-yet-mysterious-and-totally-bloodthirsty woman after them... now you’ve got the basic idea behind “Visitors Only.” 
“Visitors Only” is the story of Rome and Patrick as they close out a deal with a client that will make them all rich at the expense of the masses. Despite an invitation to stay and celebrate, they bid farewell for the night to catch a red-eye flight home. When their attempts to leave are thwarted at every turn, they realize they’ve been locked in after hours. That’s when our two visitors discover there are always consequences for their actions, and retribution comes in a form they'd least expect.
We envision “Visitors Only” as an oddball collision of comedy and terror (along with some moral questions about social inequality and injustice) and our goal is to make audiences laugh, maybe even squirm, and definitely take them by surprise.
The goal for our team is to see “Visitors Only” find an audience in film festivals across the country. We’re confident that our film will rival so many other great short films that get selected every year, and we want this to be our entry into the scene. 
With your backing, we’ll be able to incorporate some advanced special makeup effects and stunts, as well as cover a portion of our equipment and post-production expenses.
Just as essential, you’ll also help us with entry fees and travel expenses throughout our anticipated film festival run in 2017 in which we’ll be submitting to the likes of SXSW, Fantastic Fest, Sundance and more.
In return, we're making a number of fun rewards available to backers of all levels, from the kitschiest of souvenirs (a fridge magnet) to being our guest at a special event (a closed invitiation-only screening) to a chance to be in the film (in a limited availability walk-on role). "

432,1191528478,"Our goal with this kickstarter is to raise funds for our first box. To get licensed products, handmade, and indie horror collectibles that you would enjoy. The kickstarter rewards are mostly the boxes because that is what you are wanting. There will be 4 types of boxes. Small, Large, and Collectors and Ultimate Collectors! Small will have 2-3 items per box, Large with have 5-6 items per box, and Collectors/Ultimate Collectors will have 3-5 HIGH QUALITY COLLECTORS ITEMS *More info below*. I have subscribed to other horror boxes and they are mostly filled with filler. This is one of the easiest genres to do a subscription box and there is no reason they should be messing up, the only reason I can see they do is because they want as much profit as possible so they make ""exclusive in house generic items"" to save money. We want quality outside of quantity. In the future we are looking into possibly including Fangoria magazine or Scream Magazine. We are also in talks with Fright Rags about inlcuding shirts once in awhile. What can you expect in these boxes? Dvd's, shirts, collectibles, handmade items and more.    
Special Note with the Collectors Edition boxes. What we will do is send out a survey after you have signed up an extensive one that asks for instance, are you into comics, are you into older horror movies, indie, b horror, what is your favorite horror movies, are you into foreign horror movies, what do you NOT want in your box, are you into handmade items, are you into supernatural *ghosts etc*, what are your favorite horror characters, are you into horror tv shows, and more. It will have questions to fill out and checklist type. Just like BoBoS does but way more extensive because we don't want to give you in the Collectors Edition anything you already have or DON'T WANT! This box will be for the Hardcore collector. We are talking Neca Figures, Autographs/Autographed merch, Mini Busts etc.
Our ultimate goal is to make you the customer coming back and happy, not quantity of customers. We are modeling our business after Big Ol Box of Stuff as giving you the customer the collectibles you want with the personal touch. Right now our boxes are only available in the U.S. and Canada but we plan to expand worldwide if we get a steady subscriber base. We hope you take this journey with us as me and my wife are huge horror fanatics from everything like black and white Nosferatu to Killer Klowns from Outer Space to Freaks of Nature. We want to provide you with the collectibles of unique horror films that other boxes don't along with the classics. Tired of generic zombie stuff and the same stuff every box? Then come join us! There will be no refunds just because you don't like the items in the box. This is a mystery subscription box.
If we unlock the stretch goals they will go up each time we get another 250 so first one you get 10$ added to the box, another 250 pledged instead of 10 you get 20 added to the box and so on!

433,361484095,"I'm a graphic designer and artist who has been studying and practicing shamanism since 2007. As a designer I am often drawn to visual symbolism that has value and meaning, and over the past few months, through my own shamanic practice, I have been developing a series of geometric sacred designs, using power symbols that, I think, will appeal to both those with, or without, a shamanic (and/or other interests) background. 
These designs are rooted in ancient symbolism where the symbols have held strong sacred meaning throughout the ages and with which I have been inspired to create my own contemporary versions. You may choose to see these just as modern graphic designs and I would also invite you to bring your own meaning to them. 
The posters will be beautifully silkscreen printed, using a range of solid Pantone colours, including metallic inks, onto a high quality recycled paper. A local specialist printer with an excellent reputation will be responsible for the silkscreen printing and I will be close-by to monitor that each design is being met to the highest standard. Each colour version of a design is limited to a print run of 36 and will be numbered, signed and will include a blind-embossed monogram stamp for authentication. When ready, each poster, or posters, will be supplied unframed, carefully packaged, and posted using a strong heavyweight wide diameter (150mm) tube to minimise the poster roll.
All of the listed designs will be limited colour editions set below market price and once the initial programme is complete, the cost of the artwork will be adjusted accordingly. Check out the list of rewards which also includes unique offers for this Kickstarter programme. 
Please note that due to the differences with on-screen digital colour (along with screen contrast, brightness and so on) and printed colour, the colours seen on this page are a representation only of what will be the final printed colours, and should not be considered to be accurate to the final artworks (which will be more magnificent!), although the designs seen here are the digital versions of the final artworks (see also risks and challenges note below). All frames shown are for visual purposes only – posters will be supplied unframed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Crystal
The hexagon is widely considered to be a sacred shape often associated with the geometry of the natural world and is thought to be a symbol of harmony and balance. It is seen in the construction of the bee's honeycomb hive and in the make-up of the bee's eyes. The shape can be found in crystals, snowflakes and in natural rock formations such as the Giants Causeway, in Ireland. It is seen on Saturn's north pole as a cloud formation and, back-down-to-Earth, the Benzene Ring (six carbon atoms joined to form a hexagon) is the basic component of many organic compounds.
The number six is also considered to be a sacred number (and being the number of sides to the hexagon), so I designed this series of artworks with six descending hexagons in outline to make a geometric design which I've named Crystal. In this series of artworks, a set of four posters, each printed in two colours, there will be three that each use a different metallic ink – gold, silver and indigo – plus white. A fourth version which will be close to white-on-white will create a more subtle, although visible design. The poster size will be 600 x 600mm, printed on 100% recycled Paperback Cairn board (320gsm). There will be a limited edition of 36 of each one of these colour versions, with a reward opportunity to buy a complete set.

Two Serpents
The Serpent or Snake is considered to be one of the oldest and most widespread of sacred symbols. It is often seen in mythological stories and cultural rituals, and can represent the duality of things – light and dark for example.
They can be seen as symbols of fertility, creative life force, rebirth and transformation – shedding their skin – immortality, healing – the venom being used both as poison and the cure. Two serpents are seen in the Cadusceus, the staff carried by Hermes in Greek mythology and as one serpent in the Staff of Asclepius, a Greek deity associated with healing and medicine. The Hopi people of North America perform a snake dance as a rain ceremony to help in the fertility of their lands. In fact, there are so many places and occasions that serpents appear culturally around the world that it would take a few more pages to list them all here.
So, to the artworks; two serpents entwined representing the duality of the masculine and the feminine. They are connected at their tails and tongues by the Lemniscate (the sacred infinity symbol) making them 'one' – woven as a continual form that is never-ending – infinite. For some, they may see these as the world serpents Python and Typhon and, as with the other artworks, you are also invited to bring your own sacred interpretation to them.
The poster size will be 360 x 600mm, printed on 100% recycled Paperback Cairn board (320gsm). This series of four posters will be printed using three-colours (a metallic ink, plus black, plus white) for which there will be a limited edition of 36 of each. And there is a reward opportunity to buy a complete set. In addition I've included a 'special' version using the three sacred colours silver, black and red, which will also be limited to an edition of 36.

Six Hexagons: The Seasons Series
Using the hexagon form and rationale that can be seen and read in the Crystal design (see above), this series of artworks with six descending hexagons are printed as solid parts in a series of four posters; each one using five Pantone special colours representing a season – Winter, Spring, Summer and Autumn. The poster size will be 600 x 600mm and printed on 100% recycled Paperback Cairn board (320gsm). There will be a limited edition of 36 of each one of these colour versions, with a reward opportunity to buy a complete set.

2020 has set some serious moods in all of us. But this year I'm back with new pin designs to put the OOOOOOOOOOO in MOOD (because it's like a ghost noise.. get it? It's spooooooooky!)

What does the money fund?
The goal will pay for the printing of all funded pins, the shipping costs, and Kickstarter’s cut. Once the goal is reached, any extra money will go towards printing extra pins that I can then sell on my website. I’ll also have continuous stretch goals announced as previous goals are reached!

Tell me more..
All artwork is 100% original and created by me. Once the goal is funded, a 3rd party pin printer will take my artwork and create the pins.

Anything else?
Below you will find all reward levels, unlocked rewards, and a preview of all stretch goals for the entire pin set."

436,457076087,"Cheat Day Land is a pop-up museum under construction in Los Angeles. The creators want to add a free exhibit dedicated to the subject of body positivity while addressing body dysmorphia in the food and fitness industry. Just weeks into creating an active online presence for the museum to be, thousands of people flocked to our Instagram to share their concerns about the name of our creation, Cheat Day Land. They expressed that the word “cheat” is connected with diet culture creating a trigger that can be dangerous for people with eating disorders.
The eating disorder community did make one big request, to change the name of our museum, however, for Rubi and our family (The co-founders) altering the name of our pop-up museum point would change the message altogether, and the honesty of our perspective and experience coming through our art would be lost, but we are listening.
Body dysmorphia, is a real problem within the food and fitness industry; the industry that inspired the creation of Cheat Day Land. We would like to create a free exhibit in the museum dedicated to the discussion of body positivity as it relates to body dysmorphia addressing the subjects of eating disorders, muscle dysmorphia, and the negative stigmas attached to the foods we eat and love that have existed for so long in our society. The money will be used to pay architects and engineers to help us redesign the layout of the museum, so we can offer this exhibit for free, while meeting building and safety regulations. Building materials. Funding to collaborate with experts in the fields of body positivity and body dysmorphia, for both the design of the exhibit and to hold talks to educate the public about these issues. And of course MORE ART! We want to reach out to artists with experience and passion for this very subject matter.
This part of the exhibit would address the habits that lead to body dysmorphia, and discuss how the “cheat meal” may not be a healthy choice for people who are struggling with eating disorders. It will discuss body positivity, self acceptance, and body autonomy. We want to make this a free part of the museum that is open to everyone, even if they choose not to purchase a ticket to the rest of Cheat Day Land. This exhibit is meant to educate the public about body positivity and body disorders and provide education on healthy ways to attain your personal optimal health."

Hi! 
My name is Mateo, I was born in Uruguay and moved to Spain when I was 5 years old. Music has always been in my life ever since I remember and decided I wanted to study and pursue music at the age of 6. I started by playing saxophone, and then moved on to piano and guitar, having taught myself how to play those last two. 
When I was awarded a full scholarship to go to London for a year to study music songwriting and production, I was so excited that I started to write plenty of songs. Some of those were pretty bad, but some others were actually quite good, and to be honest, I used to dedicate them to my to-be girlfriends. 
I've been writing music ever since, mostly for the US Market, having reached two #1 radio singles here in Spain, and millions of streams worldwide. 
Now, I've put together a team of 3 songwriters and 2 producers to be able to develop this platform, where you will be able to ""buy"" a song and dedicate it to someone you love. 
We will write and produce 40-60 professional and modern instrumentals, and those will be completed with what you enter in the quick form. When you purchase a song, you'll get a professional recording from one of our singers, and also the instrumental in case you want to sing it yourself, but you will never get the rights to either publish or sell the song. So it is not a songwriting service for artists, but for normal people who want to give something personal, special, and really original. 
We really believe in this project and think that with the right promotion and hard work it can grow exponentially in a matter of months. 
We're already working on the website with a professional company, fully functional in April 2020. The beta version of the website can be visited here: www.wish4asong.com 

Everything is going to move so quickly from now on, therefore, we need your help and support to make sure we have the resources needed to run everything smoothly and correctly, and to provide the idea with organic growth across the world.

Thank you so much for taking the time to read all of this, and we'll see each other along the journey!"

In the end, she barely escaped with her life.
Kelly went with us to New York to speak at our “Trading on the Female Body” event and at the United Nations as part of the 61st Commission on the Status of Women. She even went with us to Madrid, Spain, where she spoke to numerous media outlets, to a large crowd attending a screening of our film Breeders: A Subclass of Women?, and to members of every faction in the Spanish Parliament. 
We want for even more people to hear her story, so we are making a full documentary on her. 
We are working with an incredibly talented editor, and together we’re in the midst of cutting the film, honing the story, adding in b-roll, and all the other technical details that will make our film the very best it can be.
Then, in the Fall, we'll launch it out into the world. We need to market the film, put it up on all our usual distribution platforms, and do premiere screenings, especially in places where surrogacy-related legislation is under discussion. 
We cannot do this without you!
Take a look at the rewards or give simply because this is for a good cause. Please help us finish Kelly’s story and share it with the world.

440,1739155442,"Brian was severely burned when he was 5 years old. He lost his father in the fire that  destroyed his house and left him in the hospital for months. Now a teenager, the burns are still visible and the memories still haunting. Brian is subject to bullies at school, and has often thought about killing himself. 
Joan, a new girl in school, befriends him. Joan is blind, and can't understand why people tease Brian. Freak is a story about friendship, overcoming obstacles in life and finding meaning with each other.
Story behind the inspiration.
I was working at a local school, helping with book week. One day, we had a wear a quote to school day. I searched the internet and found a quote from Mark Twain. It read, 'Kindness is the language  the blind can see and the deaf can hear.' 
The words inspired the idea for Freak. I had never read a  story where the two main characters were either blind or burned. I wondered what would happen to these characters, and how they would help each other. Joan, who is blind, would be less concerned about the appearance of people, and more concerned about the sole and character of the person. Brian, a young man on the verge of suicide might find hope in humanity by Joan's actions. 
I hope this story can teach lessons about bullying in school, and help other young people subjected to this kind of treatment."
441,1059635845," ""A Love That Can't Be Won,"" is our first full length album ever! This album is a compilation of creative ideas from each of Lily Among Thorns' band members. Our music reflects who we are as a band--a blossom of hope in a dark and dying world. We seek to share with our listeners the personal and collective struggles and triumphs we have endured. As stated in the video, this album truly encompasses a redemption story of our souls as we grow closer to our Creator. We hope that this music touches the hearts of all who hear it, and encourages our listeners to hold on to a greater hope. 
The finished product will have ten tracks: The Harlot, This Prison, Stay, Unspoken Unheard, Fool's Gold, Le Rêve, The Becoming War, Never Forget, and Rushing Rivers. All of the songs have already been recorded, however, Lily Among Thorns is lacking the funds to package the final product. All of the money made during this campaign will be put towards purchasing hard copies of the new full length album, ""A Love That Can't Be Won."" We are hoping to raise at least 1,000 dollars to cover the costs of ordering the CDs. Any money exceeding our goal amount will go to purchasing other merchandise such as t-shirts and posters. The financial aid will help us expand our ministry in other areas as well. We would like to eventually purchase our own stage equipment and tour the states. Any donations made during this kickstarter will help make that dream a reality. 
Thank you so much for your interest in Lily Among Thorns. We are looking forward to completing this project with your help.

442,2053003521,"Background information about this project:
I have travelled to México, Guatemala, and El Salvador over the past three years to document the surgical treatment of children affected by birth defects, primarily cleft lip and palate, microtia, and Treacher Collins syndrome. Central American children are roughly twice as likely to be born with a birth defect than children in the United States. This high prevalence can be attributed to the low maternal socioeconomic status as well as environmental factors. Affected children are more often born into poverty; the relationship between this high rate of birth defects and poverty is positively correlated. 
I have been on four trips with medical teams that seek to amend many of the difficulties in health, comfort, and functionality that these children face. Aside from the difficulties in health these children will address through many stage of their lives, they are typically subjected to ostracism in their communities and from their peers. Often born into poverty, they are unable to break the cycle and lead more fulfilled lives. What I am trying to do with this trip is to spend time with families that are affected by both poverty and by the high rate of birth defects its effects on the emotional and social wellness of the child- to further analyze and highlight through photography the relationship between the consequences of poverty, such as poor to no prenatal healthcare and family planning, diet, lack of education, and the commonality of birth defects. 
What I'm doing with this trip:
The images I hope to capture from this trip will offer insight and perspective on international healthcare and the deeper effects of poverty in our neighboring countries - in an individualized, personal way; visual storytelling. I feel that I have thoroughly covered the medical perspective of this social epidemic, and now I would like to show daily life. I hope to gather a better understanding of the causes  of these defects (education? Prenatal care? Diet? Environment?) and how life in poverty is proven more difficult with a potentially debilitating condition. 
These are the questions burning to be addressed: 
Do these children feel they have the same opportunities as their peers of similar socioeconomic standing? Do they hope and plan for the future? Do they feel that they are treated differently? Do they feel overall content in their lives?
My questions pertaining to the relationship between poverty and the rate of congenital anomalies that I will address regard the families' social and economic standing that will be identified through photographic imagery. I am not a scientist or an epidemiologist, however, I feel that this issue can be highlighted through visual imagery and allow the stories to speak for themselves through my photography. 
Where your funding goes:
I have a place to stay, a translator, and safe transportation for my trip. All I need is the plane ticket and funding for various printing or book making following the completion of this project. Your funding will serve these children by visually sharing their stories and experiences, and will allow them the attention and international focus they deserve.

Like an illustrated RPG of Mermaids, Adventurer Mermaids, Baddas Mermaids and Royal Mermaids you can find in all the book.

Any copies left will be sold at comic fairs etc when the world is safe again to do so.
Day One - Poisonous
Obviously if I manage to sell all the 50 copies (or more) on here I will use the savings, for printing higher volumes, to add extra stuff (see Stretch goals below)
For full transparency, in the event 50 or more are sold, I will be making no money on these as I want to provide the best quality package I can - at this point in time I feel everyone could benefit from a cool package of stuff to keep them going.
Day Ten - Flowing
Any money raised past the target will be used to improve the rewards where possible, and anything left over will be donated to charity.

Hi! We’re Katarina and Justine, the two people behind Jelly Kat Studio. We’ve been making enamel pins since September 2019, and started selling on our website in December 2019. Since then, we’ve made more than 15 different designs in multiple versions; mostly original designs, though a couple have been of games/shows we really love.
This is our first time doing a Kickstarter, so hopefully things go well! 
So far, we’ve self funded every single pin we’ve produced, but we’ve never done a large set all at once, since that requires a much higher investment! Thus, we’re hoping running this as a Kickstarter will allow us to make this full set all at once!
Kickstarter as a crowd-funding platform is super; it’s an all-or-nothing campaign, so if we don’t get enough to make the pins, you won’t be charged at all! And if you don’t have the money right now, don’t fret! You can select your reward tier, then at the end date listed on the top of the page, if we’re successful, you’ll be charged then.
You can always increase/decrease or even cancel your pledge at any time during the campaign, risk-free. With your pledges, we’ll be able to have more of this collection made, so do pledge for how many of them you’d love to have!
This will also be the cheapest you’ll be able to obtain these pins - once they show up on our website, they will be more expensive to purchase. We've also included tracked shipping worldwide in our budget, so you won't need to worry about where you're pledging from!
Of course, don’t hesitate to ask any questions if you have them!
These pins will be approximately 1.8 inches (4.5cm), with Gold, Silver or Rose Gold Plating, which you can see in detail below. They will all be Hard Enamel, sections of glitter and with screen printing.
They will also have 2 pin backs with rubber backings and a branded back stamp.
VENUS UNLOCKED
MERCURY UNLOCKED
JUPITER UNLOCKED


If we unlock all designs, all pin pledges will get vinyl stickers to match the pins they’ve pledged for
Sticker example - colours may change
AND
All backers for the full set of pins will get free Artemis and Luna mini pins!
 UPDATE: All pin backers will also get this print based on the Artemis and Luna pins!
Free print for all pin backers
Minor changes may happen before printing
This is a representation of what we're aiming for the backing card to look like. The card will have gold foil to have that classic, romantic vibe.
Early bird backers: If you want to stay in your pledge tier, but still add on more pins, please add an additional AU$18/pin.
Standard backers: For more pins, please upgrade to the next tier above.

August 5th: Kickstarter funds received
Late August/Early September: Pins are completed and shipped to us
Early/Late September: Pins are shipped out and are on their way to your hands/shirts/hats/pinboards!
We will be mailing using DHL E-Commerce, from Melbourne, Australia.
* Domestic backers: Your pins should arrive in 3-5 days.
* International backers: Your pins will take anywhere between 2-8 weeks for delivery.
Please be aware that International backers are responsible for any customs fees their country may ask for, so plan accordingly!
Misc covers for any unexpected conversion fees

If you want to see more of our stuff, you can check it out on our website or social media pages. We also have a Discord! You can find all the links here. We’d absolutely love to hear from you.
Having done this for almost a year now, we’re very confident with our manufacturing process. We work directly with our factories and account reps, and maintain good relationships and communication. The factory we’ll be using for the manufacturing of these pins will be one we’ve worked with on similar levels of complexity in design."
446,1950044274,"For our new album ‘Gypsy Hill: Producing’ we took a slightly different approach - by exploring carefully chosen collaborations with some of our favourite artists. The album features the not inconsiderable talents of Koby Israelite, Simo Lagnawi, Swingrowers, Hallouminati, Alejandro Toledo, The Din and last but not least, globetrotting super-group The Turbans.
Much more than the remix approach we’ve used in the past, this time around we produced each artist’s song from the ground up. The result is a mix of electronic driven tunes and more traditional ones, all tied together with our production values and ear for a good hook!
The album has already been recorded, mixed & mastered - so now we're looking to raise funds in order to cover production of the CDs and a beautiful colour vinyl with gatefold cover. The latter features behind-the scenes-photos from the recording sessions we've had with all these amazing artists. It really will be a treat and we can wait to share it with you all.

 The Story.
Absence. Where I grew up, there was no Asian-American community. I faced my differences alone. How I looked. What I ate. Even what I believed in. It wasn't until I moved to Mott Street in New York City's Chinatown that I found a sense of belonging.

It was recorded in May, 2017, in St. Augustine, FL, right before I left on a five month tour. I am currently traveling the east coast (and Colorado) performing at Renaissance fairs. I recorded with several incredible musicians from the Renaissance world to showcase the hammered dulcimer and my favorite traditional Celtic tunes.
Note: There is no singing on this album. Just could not convince anyone that “diedle deedle dee deedle dooo” are deep and heartfelt lyrics. ;)
I've played the hammered dulcimer for five years, four professionally. Previously performing at Celtic festivals, Steampunk events and house concerts with the bands Jig to a Milestone and Dancing Hammers.
The hammered dulcimer has an incredible quality and ability to reach people. The instrument and sound harkens back to an earlier age. Hammered dulcimer has opened up the world to me; it gives me a reason, a passion to share and experience music with others. Sharing the instrument's culture and history all while making it accessible to the modern world is one of my life’s goals. 
What does it sound like?
20 Tunes! ~12 Tracks! A whole hour of Celtic goodness! 
This is my first solo album, it features accompaniments by local and national renaissance fair performers. When I reached out, many of you suggested I go with the a session sound for this album. (Though if you like just dulcimer, might I suggest my Christmas album?) Multiple instruments give the music a variety of textures, besides, it is always more fun to play with other people! 
 This album uses traditional instrumentation such as the Bodhran: a Celtic frame drum, the tenor banjo: a four stringed pain in the butt to keep in tune, and the Irish flute: also known as a wooden tooter. This traditional accompaniment brings the joy of an Irish Session into your very own home.
That's us, well some of us, doing what we do.
 Irish Sessions are a lovely affair where in many unsuspecting victims, I mean patrons, happen upon a bunch of musicians piled into the corner of an Irish pub. These musicians are all furiously beating their instruments, playing what sounds like same tune with periodic stops for drinking, key changes and bouts of laughter. They continue to do so for about three hours. Through this recording I hope you can hear the joy of a session you might run into at your local Irish pub on a Sunday night. 
Featuring!
This album is full of my favorite people (at least the ones I could get to St. Augustine before I left on tour). These amazing performers came together to help me showcase everything the hammered dulcimer has to offer.
Not the most flattering photo, but fairly accurate.
 Bret Blackshear has been on ¾ of my previous albums and takes a real spotlight in this one. He plays tenor banjo and guitar on most of the tracks. Without him I could not have recorded this album.
Recording and playing at the same time!
It was a dream come true working with Billy Miller from Hooligan. I visited him in St. Petersburg, FL. Billy played guitar and flute, he also recorded the four tracks he is on. 
So much focus.
Tyler Solomon rips into the bodhran. He had also recorded with me on Crawford's Pub. His grasp of the melodic nature of the drum is tremendous. 
After a long day of recording!
Robbie Zukauskas is the most technically talented musician I have ever had the pleasure of performing with. She is a force of nature on the Irish flute and penny whistle. Recording with her again was a delight. 
He gets a glamour shot.
Jerry Barry brought the bass for this album. Though he is best know for his incredible songwriting previously in Minstrels of Mayhem and currently in the New Minstrel Revue.
He had to record himself.
 Daniel O'Ryan of The Craic added his own touch to two of the tracks while we were in Colorado together. 
Mixing and recording in his natural environment.
This album is recorded and mixed by Micah Gilliam in St. Augustine, FL. He performs solo and with the groups the Young Step and the Will-o-Wacks.

449,1366150414,"Hi, my name is Jack Mifflin. I am a wildlife photographer with a passion for less appreciated animals, seeking to bring an awareness to what otherwise can be overlooked in the eyes of many. These goats are an animal I have become very passionate about. After documenting this species, you can see that each animal has a personality. Some are more lively than others and some more willing to be photographed. In this book I will share with you the life of this beautiful and overlooked animal, I hope you can see my passion through my work and enjoy the beauty of this species. 
The story
This story all started whilst researching suitable subjects for my dissertation. I didn't really know about, and had not thought about feral goats in Britain, so was instantly fascinated by these nimble goats and the fact they could be found so close to home. I realised that I knew nothing about the species because very little have been published about them. As I dug further into my research, I was shocked by the negativity these goats are facing and how they are considered to be a pest by many people in Scotland. Furthermore, there is not an abundance of photographs of these goats, unlike the other favoured Scottish wildlife such as red squirrels, deer and eagles. The main issue facing this animal is culling. Everyone knows about the deer culling happening in Scotland. However, I had not heard about goats being culled. I decided I needed to photograph these goats, and see for myself what they were like, the problems they could cause but also see if there are benefits to this species.

From the moment I first saw this species I was captivated. I knew I had to tell their story and set about taking photographs to show the goats as a glorious, amazing species. I wanted to show them as something other than a nuisance or a target. I followed the goats up the steepest cliff faces, watched them nurse their newborn kids and their interactions with each other, as well as watching them eat the days away. As I was in Scotland over December, January and February, I was lucky enough to see many new kids, as the goats give birth during these harsh winter months. I learnt the struggle of these kids to stay alive as they faces the harsh Scottish environment and became attached to the beautiful species.
Over my time in Scotland, I met many people whom I asked about the goats. It became clear that some of these people were incredibly passionate about the goats and were desperate not to lose the species, they viewed them as a delight. However, lots of people viewed the goats as a nuisance, destroying land and getting in the way with their habits of destruction. There were also a few that I saw did not have a clear love or hate opinion, they were conflicted as to whether the joy of the goats was outweighed by their destruction and vice versa.
The British Primitive Goat is thought to have arrived in Britain when the first Neolithic farmers landed, about 5000 years ago, originating from south-eastern Europe and the Middle East. This small-bodied, long-haired, hardy goat; produced rich milk, meat, skins, hair and tallow for many Mediaeval manors and herders. This made it an invaluable resource and was often considered the ‘poor man's cow’ due to its resourcefulness and affordability. The species was crucial to the Cheddar Cheese industry until the late 18th century. However, when new Swiss and Nubian breeds were introduced, they could produce far more milk and so the British Primitive Goats became less appealing and were eventually disregarded completely.
Today, the goats are subject to constant debate over whether they should be culled. Management of the Feral Goats can alter according to the estate in which they are found. The main reason behind the culling of this species is to manage the numbers in a herd. These animals can cause significant damage to an area if they remain there for a prolonged amount of time. A single goat can eat up to 2kg of food each day and with 70% of their diet being wood- based, a small herd can strip an area in a small amount of time. If this is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) or an area where woodland regeneration is taking place, then many organisations and individuals want the goats to be eradicated before they can damage to an important habitat.
Although culling is important to many species, it helps overgrazing of a certain habitat and reduces the possibility of starvation to a herd. I believe the British Primitive Goat needs to be managed in a specific way. With less than 1200 individuals remaining, it is important for organisations such as Scottish National Heritage (SNH) to look into different options in controlling herd populations. Another option that is currently being trialled, is birth control in the RSPB Inversnaid Reserve. This involved 50 goats (both male and female) at RSPB Inversnaid Reserves being shot with a contraceptive dart. This way of controlling numbers without death is more costly as it took a team of marksmen from Animal Welfare Solutions a week to complete, but it does mean that the goats cannot breed for 3 years after injection, and numbers will naturally fall. Another solution to culling and birth control of the goats is to be taken into an animal sanctuary. Hillside animal sanctuary (based outside Norwich) has offered to take a number of the goats instead of the alternatives. Unfortunately this has not been in effect as the commute from the highlands of Scotland to Norwich could be stressful and damaging to any goats that make the journey. These goats have an important heritage and they were once a frequent sight on British landscapes. As this is no longer the case, should we look to preserve these wild goats that do remain?
Where your pledge would go
Your pledge will cover the cost of printing and finish a high-quality photo book. It is common for the artist to fund and share the cost of the book. Unfortunately, as a student, I cannot finish this project by myself. I am asking for your help to make this dream a reality. This book is important because the goats have a story to be told, it should not go unnoticed or become forgotten.  All the funding from Kickstarter will go into printing and finishing the final book, which I am self-publishing. The cost of printing 250 copies of the book will be £2,138. The rest has been allocated to postage and fees. The trips to, from, and around Scotland, as well as the design of the book have all been funded and paid for by myself. This means that 100% of your donation will go into funding the production of the book. If my goal is reached, or even better, peaks the original target, all money not allocated for printing and postage will be donated to the Feral Goat Research Group (link below). They are the only group carrying out in-depth research of this species. 
If you like my project, and chose to support it, I am deeply appreciative and thank you in advance for helping raise awareness of this incredible species.

Breakdown In chart form.
  Giving back for my project
While shooting my project I did travel nearly 2400 miles. With energy use for printing and shipping my entire project would have produced around 2.296 tonnes of CO2e. So I have decided to offset my carbon footprint with the help of Carbon Footprint LTD. By planting a number of trees in school areas around the South West of England, my project will educate children on issues facing their local habitat and support a number of habitats across the South West.

450,1281875416,"Terremoto est une maison d’édition née en 2016 à Bordeaux sous l’impulsion de trois jeunes passionnés d’art (Pierrick Falmon, Clémentine Moncla et Adrien Torgina).
La composante majeure de ce projet est l’édition de livres de tous formats (bande dessinée, roman, conte, recueil, etc.) impliquant la mise en valeur de personnalités artistiques qui se situent au croisement des arts : nous travaillons avec des illustrateurs, street artists, directeurs artistiques ou encore musiciens.
Quel est notre premier projet ? 
 Le premier projet de Terremoto est la publication du roman graphique intitulé Le Désorganisme de Daniel Johnston, réalisé par l’artiste espagnol Ricardo Cavolo. Cet ouvrage est une biographie dessinée qui retrace la vie tumultueuse du chanteur américain Daniel Johnston à travers le trait sensible et la palette ultra-colorée bien propres à Ricardo Cavolo.
Le Désorganisme de Daniel Johnston propose au néophyte de découvrir l’univers déluré du mythe américain qu’est Daniel Johnston, et à l’amateur aguerri de s’y replonger en savourant l’interprétation graphique et narrative de l’auteur.
Ce roman graphique sortira en France en novembre 2016 si vous remplissez cette campagne participative avec nous !
Couverture du Désorganisme de Daniel Johnston
Qui est Ricardo Cavolo ? 
Parmi toutes les casquettes qu’il revêt, Ricardo Cavolo apparaît comme un des artistes espagnols les plus internationaux de cette décennie.
Ses fresques murales peuvent se voir dans les plus grandes villes du monde (Montréal, Moscou, Londres, Madrid, Mexico, Barcelone, etc.) et ses illustrations ornent bon nombre de livres publiés dans le monde hispanophone et anglosaxon. Il est lui-même l’auteur de plusieurs ouvrages publiés en Espagne (Lunwerg, Edicions de Ponent) et aux Etats-Unis (Two Dollars Radio).
Seule erreur dans l’équation : Ricardo Cavolo n’a encore jamais eu l’occasion de montrer ses super-pouvoirs en France. Aidez-nous à remédier à cette tragédie !
Ricardo Cavolo devant une de ses fresques
Comment rendre ce projet réel ? 
A ce jour, le travail d’édition du Désorganisme de Daniel Johnston est déjà très avancé puisque nous avons :
- Acheté les droits du livre à la maison d’édition espagnole (Edicions de Ponent) pour être autorisés à le publier en France;
- Traduit intégralement le texte (sous la vigilance de notre correctrice Amélie Blais);
- Réalisé la couverture avec l’aide de Ricardo Cavolo;
- Préparé la maquette pour l’imprimeur (grâce à l'application de Valentin Verardo)
- Choisi le papier sur lequel sera imprimé le livre;
- Déterminé une liste des libraires susceptibles de le proposer à la vente.
Jusqu’à présent, l’intégralité de la réalisation de ce livre a été assurée par nos soins, ce qui nous a permis des économies importantes pour le lancement d’une telle activité. Avant que ce livre ne se retrouve chez vos libraires préférés, une étape s’impose que nous ne pouvons pas réaliser nous-mêmes: l’impression. C’est l’étape la plus coûteuse et nous n’avons aujourd’hui pas les fonds nécessaires pour la faire réaliser.
...Et c’est là que vous intervenez !
(La première page du livre)
  A quoi sert cette campagne de financement participatif ? 
Nous avons besoin de 10,000€ pour couvrir les frais du lancement de notre premier livre :
- 8,500€ pour imprimer le livre sur un papier de qualité et avec des méthodes mettant en valeur les illustrations de Ricardo Cavolo (budget estimé à partir de devis réalisés auprès de différents imprimeurs français)
- 1,500€ pour couvrir nos frais de communication liés au lancement du premier livre (création du site Internet, impression des cartes de visites et documents de présentation, etc.)
Cette campagne de financement participatif nous permet de concrétiser un projet éditorial passionnant qui se trouve sur le point d'exister, et vous permet de participer à l'aventure de Terremoto à la hauteur de votre choix.
A noter : 10,000€ représente pour nous un minimum à atteindre. Aidez nous à dépasser ce palier ! Plus nombreux vous serez à vous mobiliser, meilleure sera la qualité d'impression de notre premier livre et plus fous seront les projets que nous pourrons lancer en suivant.
10,000€ = lancement de l'impression du premier livre
> 10,000€ = lancement du deuxième livre (plus d’information une fois le palier dépassé)
Pourquoi participer à cette campagne de financement participatif ? 
Pour recevoir Le Désorganisme de Daniel Johnston dès son impression et/ou des tas d’autres contreparties originales.
Pour le plaisir de voir Terremoto et Ricardo Cavolo sur les étagères de vos libraires préférés, mais aussi de vos amis.
Pour soutenir le projet d’une maison d’édition (Terremoto) qui va bien au-delà de la publication d’un ouvrage : autobiographies d’artistes, contes musicaux, romans graphiques et beaucoup d’autres projets sont déjà en train de mijoter…
Petit aperçu des cadeaux que nous avons prévus pour vous
---------------FOR OUR NON-FRENCH-SPEAKER FRIENDS---------------
In 2016 the publishing house Terremoto was created in Bordeaux, France by three art lovers: Pierrick Falmon, Clémentine Moncla, and Adrian Torgina.
The major goal of this project is to publish books under various formats (graphic novels, novels, fairytales, poetry, etc.). All of our publications seek to highlight multidisciplinary artists. We are working with illustrators, street artists, art directors, and even musicians.
What is our first project? 
Terremoto's first publication will be a French translation of Spanish artist, Ricardo Cavolo’s, graphic novel entitled Le Désorganisme de Daniel Johnston. This book is a drawn biography which, in a colorful and sensitive way, tells the stormy life of legendary American singer Daniel Johnston.
Le Désorganisme de Daniel Johnston is an invitation to discover Daniel Johnston's mad and genius universe and/or to rediscover it through graphical interpretation and storytelling.
The book will launch in November of 2016 if you can help us reach our 10,000€ goal in this Kickstarter campaign!
Who is Ricardo Cavolo? 
Ricardo Cavolo is one of the most internationally recognized Spanish artists of the past ten years.
His murals can be seen in major cities all around the world including: Montréal, Moscow, London, Madrid, Mexico City, and Barcelona. He is the author of books published in Spain through Lunwerg and Editions de Ponent, and in the United States through Two Dollar Radio. His art has been used to illustrate many books written by authors in both Spanish and English.
There is one issue with Ricardo Cavolo’s career: he has never shared his super-powers in France! Help us fix this problem!
How will you make this project real? 
Currently, we are very close to finishing our project. So far we have:
- Purchased the rights for Le Désorganisme de Daniel Johnston from the Spanish publishing house Edicions de Ponent, and have been authorized to publish it in French;
- Painstakingly translated the text from Spanish to French with the help of our proofreader, Amélie Blais;
- Created a new cover design for the French edition with the help of Ricardo Cavolo;
- Prepared the model for the printer;
- Chosen the paper the book will be printed on;
- Identified the points of sales.
Until now we have been responsible for all the work in this process, and it has allowed us to save a lot of money. The last step, before you can find our book in your favorite bookshops, is the printing. This is the most expensive part of the project, and we can’t make it happen without your help!
What is this Kickstarter campaign for? 
We must raise 10,000€ to launch our first book. The cost breakdown is as follows:
- 8,500€ to print the book on high quality paper which will properly showcase Ricardo Cavolo's illustrations (price established after comparing several French professional printers);
- 1,500€ to pay for our website and promotional materials.
Important note: 10,000€ is a minimum goal! In this campaign more money means a higher quality of production. It will also help us launch the many more crazy, fantastic, and whimsical projects we have planned for the future.
10,000€ = First book printed
> 10,000€ = Second book launched (more information when first goal is reached!)
Why do you need to take part in this campaign? 
It is the easiest way to get Le Désorganisme de Daniel Johnston as soon as it is printed, and a lot of nice goodies.
It is the only way to be able see Terremoto and Ricardo Cavolo some day on French bookshops' shelves.
It is the best way to help a new publishing house lead a lot of passionating projects: artists' autobiographies, musical fairytales, more graphic novels and plenty of other things are coming !
THANK YOU!!!

451,975289361,"Thanks for checking out my project.
In 2009, horror writer Nicholas Grabowsky released his book of short stories and novellas entitled Red, Wet, Dirt.  Filled with a variety of unique stories, Red, Wet, Dirt provided great material to adapt into the comic book medium and I immediately took an interest in The Father Keeper, a story featuring a legendary flesh eater that arrives on the shores of an ancient Minoan city, infecting its population. A young boy's father is summoned by the pompous king to watch over this creature which has become an undead garbage disposal, but the father is soon infected himself. This begins a tale of a son who must journey with his undead father to see the king as a natural disaster looms over the island.
I quickly went to work creating the comic adaptation for a graphic novel format of this great story.  With the help of artist Joseph Canave and Inker / Colorist Terence Muncy, what was once just words on a page have become a fully illustrated graphic novel.
 By supporting this project, you are helping to establish the black and white run of this book that will be offered at many Midwestern comic book conventions during 2015.  The goal is to eventually create a full-color version as we continue to spread the word about this great story.
As a special incentive for our Kickstarter backers on this project, we have created three prints from the book that you can enjoy.  These full color 8X10 prints will be a great addition to your Nicholas Grabowsky collection and will look great adorning your wall.
 If you can't get enough of zombies, then check out the incentive levels featuring my other book called, The Survivor's Zombinac.  This black and white 116 pg graphic novel is described as Mad Magazine meets The Walking Dead in the 1950's.  Find out more about the book at FIGIDPress.com.
 In exchange for your support, I've put together some great incentives for you.  The book is ready to print and my goal is to get all incentives shipped in November so you have them in time for Christmas.

452,1795021695,"Det svenska samhällskontraktet är under förändring. Men utan någon egentlig diskussion. Vi befinner oss, inom en snar framtid, vid en punkt där vi måste välja väg, ett val där vi som samhälle måste hantera en rad målkonflikter som blivit akuta. Utvecklingen är inte ny, den började egentligen för mer än 30 år sedan men har forcerats på grund av de senaste årens okontrollerbara befolkningsökning. Vi hade, även utan migrationen 2011-2015 hamnat i denna situation förr eller senare. De senaste årens migration har bara forcerat behovet av att göra ett val för nästa generation.
Nästa generation kommer inte som vi ta emot ett bättre samhälle än de själva ärvde av sina föräldrar och farföräldrar. Väljer vi inte klokt, och under kontrollerade former, riskerar vi lämna över ett samhälle med i allt väsentligt sämre förutsättningar till våra barn och barnbarn än det vi fick.
Syftet med ""Efter Sverige - En bok om samhällskontrakt"" är att dels ge en bas för vad ett samhällskontrakt, eller socialt kontrakt, är. En historisk tillbakablick sedan två tusen år där det blir klart att människan är ett socialt väsen som hela tiden måste förhålla sig till en större gemenskap för sitt skydd och sin utveckling. 
Samhällskontraktet i sin svenska version ges även det ett utrymme. Vad vi upplever vi har avtalat om och var vi egentligen står idag.
Boken ger en bred bild av hur Sverige mår idag. Vad som skiljer från det kontrakt vi upplever och vad som egentligen levereras av oss till oss själva. Allt är inte siffror utan även hur vi börjat förhålla oss till varandra.

I den slutliga diskussionen presenteras fyra alternativ där ett av alternativen är att inte göra något val alls. Där finns det omfattande internationell empiri att dra erfarenheter av vilket gör att vi redan nu kan predestinera vad ett icke-val kommer leda till.
De ekonomiska medel som förhoppningsvis kommer in kommer att finansiera dels en assistent på deltid, dels att kunna köpa loss den statistik som finns på bland annat SCB. Den statistik, och de tvärvetenskapliga undersökningar som måste genomföras, finns inte idag som standardprodukter utan det kommer kräva unika samkörningar av olika databaser."

 WHAT IS KICKSTARTER
PLAY

  Hello, My name is Pan. I’m an IT geek from 9-5 and a dog nerd at all others times. A few years ago, on weekends, I started visiting dog parks. Pretending to read a book, I would wait for dogs to approach me so that I could play with them. Since then, this was my weekly adventure.
MY HAPPINESS.
LOOKING FOR DOGS!
I used to be a part-time wedding photographer. While my photos were good, I still didn't feel fulfilled. I didn't like asking people to “smile"". A smile should be natural rather than forced, especially on a wedding day. This was not my idea of true happiness, so I stopped.
These days, I’m proud to be a Pawtographer - a story teller sharing dog tales on Instagram @ThePawsome.co. My journey has begun.
""Cloud talks a lot to people and that is amusing to me."" Cloud, 12-year-old Cardigan Welsh Corgi
  Since founding The Pawsome in 2016, I have photographed more than 300 dogs, and have not had to ask a single one to “smile”. Dogs always give me a big smile - a genuine smile.
""This morning I went to grab a coffee and asked Pipa to be a good girl and stay calm. She was trying to be calm but it didn't last long, she exploded and gave a Boston Terrier a great big hug!"" Pipa, one-year-old Boxer
  ""Bobby loves chicken neck. He's had it since we brought him home. So when I say 'Do you want a chicken neck?' He'll get very excited."" Bobby, two-year-old King Charles Cavalier
  ""Everyday when we come home, Betty will bring shoes in her mouth and say hello to us."" Betty, five-year-old British Bulldog
Through my lenses and perspective, I can sense a dog’s true mood and personalities. The more photos I take and the more stories I hear, the more I am convinced that what I’ve captured is precious and truly worthy sharing with the world. That is what inspired me to create this coffee table book project, 'LIFE IS PAWSOME'.
  'LIFE IS PAWSOME' is a hardcover coffee table book with a collection of my best works of capturing pictures and stories belonging to more than 300 dogs I've met from parks and streets across Melbourne, Australia. I would love for my book to make you say “AWWW…. this is so CUTE” and break into a broad smile. I have curated photographs of my doggy friends and told their stories to evoke warmth and affection. I want every single page in this book to bring you instant happiness and joy.
'LIFE IS PAWSOME' will be published as a 23cm x 18cm hardcover art coffee table book featuring over 200 pages of happiness, 150+ dog stories and over 60 dog breeds.
During my weekend Pawtographer journey, to my surprise, I have encountered so many happy rescued dogs. Their new family enrich their life. And more importantly, in every single case, they give back so much love. They've given back hundredfold. I LOVE hearing rescued dog stories.
""Teddy is like a big brother to our girl. We adopted him eight weeks ago and he has been re-homed three times - this is definitely the last time! He has found his forever home as long as he doesn't eat our thongs!"" Teddy, 18-month-old mix terrier.
It is a fact that most animal shelters operate relying on donations from the community. Often, the financial resources the shelters have do not even come close to the amount of need they face. So, I’d like to use this campaign to raise awareness and funds for the rescue shelters and the dogs they save.
I pledge that at least 50% profit from the sales of the book will go to donation for dog shelters.
We'll donate profit to SoiDog and Starting Over Dog Rescue group
I hope that we can all come together to support more rescued dogs to find their forever home!
  We have 100% Awwwness guarantee on every book. However, if you receive this book, read all pages and you don’t say the magic word, ""AWWW... this is so CUTE"", even once. Meaning, if this book doesn't serve its purpose to give you instant happiness, you will be fully refunded.
This is a risk-free project.
My dream is to get this book to all dog lovers on this planet. To enjoy this book. To make you feel happy to be a dog lover. The book will make you smile and give you instant happiness while reading any pages. To me, this is so much more than a photo book. It is a labour of my love for dogs. Most importantly, your support of this project will help increase the chances of homeless dogs to find their forever homes.
DOG LOVERS please support the project and most importantly share it with other dog lovers and the world.  
To acknowledge your generous support of this project, I will offer you, the supporter, the opportunity to include your name in the ‘thank you’ section called ‘YOU ARE PAWSOME!’ of my book.

My name is Kirk Lindo and thank you for taking the time to view my Kickstarter Campaign.
I am an Artist, Author and Self-Publisher best known for my Vampress Luxura, Vamperoica and Super Fantasy Girls Comics, Graphic Novels and Art Books. 
The goal of this Kickstarter Campaign is to publish for the first time ever the COMPLETE COLLECTION of my VAMPEROTICA MAGAZINE series.
  In the late 1990's when the original Vamperotica Comic series was at the height of it's popularity, I decided to expand the Vamperotica brand by creating a mass market Vampire Entertainment Magazine. 
  The publication featured Comics, Art, Articles and Photo Features of Vampire related entertainment and entertainers including Artists, Models, Actors and much more. 
  These 4 volumes contain all 16 of the original issues plus 2 bonus magazines that were also published at the time. 
In addition to the Regular Cover Versions I have also created an entire ALTERNATE NUDE COVER SET that features some of the very best of the original covers.
Each book is over 140 Pages for a total combined page count of over 600 pages of Sexy Vampire Entertainment.
Almost all of the Reward Levels also have the Digital PDF versions included so that you can take these books with you wherever you go. 
The interior is scanned from the original books so all of the content is represented in this collection. 
Here are the actual page counts for each volume:
Volume One- 144 pages
Volume Two- 168 pages
Volume Three- 140 pages
Volume Four- 154 pages
This Magazine series is incredibly RARE and it is nearly impossible to find a complete collection. It took me 2 years and a lot of luck to compile these books into this set of 4 volumes.
With a total of 16 issues this was the 2nd longest running Vamperotica publication aside from the original comic series.
Each book has a gorgeous Full Color Painted cover with Black & White Interiors.

When we look at pictures, we often remember the moments we were living at that time; where we were and who we were with. To me, that's the beauty of a photograph, then they become more than just an image, they are also stories to tell. With this project, I aim to share my perspective of travel and landscape photography along with some of the memories I have from the summers of 2015 and 2016.

           ¡Hola! Soy Neo :D
Nací y crecí en la Ciudad de México. Estudié Diseño Gráfico en la UAM-X, pero mi verdadera pasión es viajar y fotografiar. Nunca me he considerado una persona de oficina, así que en la primavera del 2015 renuncié a mi aburrido trabajo y me aventuré a salir de mi zona de confort dejando todo atrás. Islandia me cautivó desde el primer momento, así que pasé los dos últimos veranos en aquel enigmático país nórdico y ahora se siente como mi segundo hogar. Sin un equipo sofisticado, busco plasmar la esencia del momento y el lugar, poniendo mi corazón en cada fotografía.

Hello! This is Neo :D
Born and raised in Mexico City. I majored in Graphic Design at UAM-X, but my real passion lies in traveling and photography. I have never considered myself an office person therefore, by spring 2015, I quit my boring job and pushed myself to go out of my comfort zone, leaving everything behind. Iceland charmed me from the very first moment, so I spent the last two summers in that enigmatic Nordic country and now it feels like my second home.  Without any fancy gear, I try to reflect the essence of moments and places, putting my heart into each photograph.

Cold colored crystals in abstract painting style, but contains lots of details and movement in each art piece. These paintings have an icy looking style, but the true inspiration comes from the mineral crystals, that have a healing effect. Hopefully these have a healing looking style as well. 
I'm an 23 years old amateur painter and designer, but painting has always been in my life. Now I think it is time to explore it, and which way is better than using Kickstarter for. I am very excited to be sharing my project with each of you. 
Framed
The print serie that I have made is bold, full of contrast and have a story to tell, which is sparkling through the colors and compositions. 
The serie have 6 unique prints of paintings, which carry a different color and detail combinations, but they all have the same theme which is very clear to see. 
In this winter, these are the perfect gifts for someone to give. They suit the cold season very good with their cold blue, silver and grey colors. 
The paintings are painted with acrylic inks on Yupo paper, which gives the deep effect. 
The prints are very limited! The available sizes are: 
A4 / 8.27 × 11.7 inch.

457,305187693,"HELLO! 
Thank you so much for making your way to my kickstarter campaign page and taking time to see what its all about. My name is Andrew Peña! Or if you've made your way here from my instagram : Dasdrew.
 I am a painter that has been going out as much as I can over these last two years to plein air paint anywhere and everywhere I can take my gouache. 
Painting has consistently opened many unexpected doors. I formed many friendships with different artists that also went out painting weekly. I would host paint meet ups where people would actually respond and join me for a few hours of painting. I was even lucky enough to collaborate with a fellow artist to have an art show that showcased my work from 2018. And now this!
 With your help, I will hopefully be able to make these two books a reality!
The books are called  ""Ins and Outs"" and ""The Small Things"" .
""Ins and Outs"" is a 5X6 book with 56+ pages of my larger plein air paintings. This size allowed me to have each painting keep to its true size that I painted it. I also have some cinematic paintings that stretch across the book. The book lays flat so the paintings are not affected by the crease and can be enjoyed in all their glory! I named it ""Ins and Outs"" because it starts off with my paintings I would do inside cafes and ends with all my outdoor paintings! Keep on scrolling to see examples of the pages in this book! XD 

 ""The Small Things"" is 40 pages of the small studies I do either before the larger paintings, or when I have a very small amount of time to get a painting done. It is this size because... well.... that literally how big these paintings are painted! The small size lets me not worry about detail and paint the big picture. I also learned a long time ago that doing a larger amount of small studies vs one or two larger paintings allows more growth as a painter. Needless to say I adopted that lesson and with this book hope now to share that small but amazingly helpful knowledge! Plus they are so crazy adorable at this size!!
There will be many opportunities to support, by either getting the 2 books separately or as a pair, getting a (3) postcard set, and/or getting original paintings! Below, you will find  photos that better explain the options, as well as a layout of all the original paintings offered as part of the funding. 
First come first serve! 
""The Post Card Set"" is a great way to support without going all in, but still getting a little something for making these books a reality.
""The Package Deal"" includes both “Ins and Outs” and ”The Small Things”. These  go hand and hand because you can see my color studies and final paintings together of a lot of the same locations... 
(also.....small book is SO CUTE!) 

“The Everything Set” is the chance to get the pair of books and the post card set strictly made for this kickstarter all together!

I'm back again for a short project to raise some funds for more art supplies :D This year especially has been a financially tough year so it would be a great help to be able to replenish some art supplies. This would also be a slightly smaller project as things have been very busy lately. 
Food! 
This time, the theme is food! They always say, the way to a person's heart is through his stomach. What's more unique and fulfilling than good food? 
To give some background, I come from Singapore, which is located in Southeast Asia. It is a tiny country but comes with its own unique food culture :3
Singapore's food is very special! Taking pride in its ethnic diversity, Singapore offers a wide variety of food from many different cultures (local food consists mostly of Chinese, Indian and Malay food), so I thought it would be meaningful to paint food during these tough times, and hopefully they will open the way to your heart ;) 
I will include information with every reward about the Singaporean food you receive, written at the back of the cards, to let you guys know more about the food! This gives a little mystery and excitement to the rewards ;)) 
Back side of the otah colour ink drawing
For now I will briefly explain the 4 foods I have drawn as samples for the rewards. 
Otah: A Southeast Asian grilled fish cake made of ground fish meat mixed with tapioca starch and spices, usually wrapped in pandan leaves to grill. 
Laksa: Laksa is a spicy noodle soup that consists of thick wheat noodles or rice vermicelli with tau pok, prawn or fish, served in spicy soup based on either rich and spicy curry coconut milk or on sour asam. 
Chilli crab: A Singaporean seafood dish, usually using mud crabs and are stir-fried in a semi-thick, sweet and savoury tomato-and-chilli-based sauce. 
Satay: A Southeast Asian dish of seasoned, skewered and grilled meat, served with a sauce (usually peanut sauce!)

The halcyon days of the seventies free festivals are long gone, yet the memories of these days live strong. We will be digging into archives to find out the inside story of hippy punk band Here and Now, journeying through time and space to discover what it was like to be centrally involved in a subversive movement.
We have a wide selection of interviewees currently confirmed including:
Gavin Da Blitz (Synthesizer/Vocals 1976-1985)
Keith th' Bass (Bass Guitar 1975-Now)
Kif Kif (Drums, 1974-1978)
Rob Bougie (Drums, 1979-1981)
Dean (Guitar, 1980-1986)
Jonathan Barnett [JB] (Journalist and band roadie 1977-1985)
Grant Showbiz (Producer/band manager, 1976-1981)
We are also trying to get hold of Steffi Sharpstrings (Guitar, 1975-1980)
Expenses breakdown: 
Most of the expenses regarding this project are for travel as we are based in Bristol but will be driving to our interviewees locations which include London, Norfolk and Glastonbury to name a few! We also require money to create promotional materials such as posters and DVD's for promoting the documentary. If we raise enough money, we would like to be able to provide a small thank you to each participant of the film too, to show our gratitude for their help. 
Director, Hayley Allardyce speaks about her influences for the film: 
""Since I found out my Dad was in Here and Now, making a documentary about the band Here and Now has always been at the back of my mind due to the fact the my Dad played with them in the 70s/80s. Growing up as a child I heard many crazy stories along with photographs I found in dusty albums, the whole family thought he should either write a book or do a documentary. Now attending uni and under going research on the band, I have found out that I'm not the only one who wants to hear the stories and reminisce in the life of the band. Which brings us to this documentary that will focus on the early years in the 70’s to the mid 80’s when the band ‘split’, looking into the how the music industry has changed, where the band fit into the industry, how they operated as a band and a family, also finding out where their ideas and inspiration came from.
My team and myself are currently beginning the interview process, however we are asking for your help by funding us, so we can finish our film. Your money will help us travel to the locations of the band members and some of the loyal companions we are talking to - Keith the Bass, Kif Kif, Gavin the Blitz, Dion, Rob, Grant Showbiz and JB (Jonathan Barrnett). You will also be helping and supporting us to enter our film into film festivals and provide advertisements in the forms of posters, media advertising and merchandise.""

We are working in a small, closely knit team so that we can maintain a consistent vision for the direction of the film: 
Director/Editor - Hayley Allardyce  
Producer - Ruth Liddell
Camera/Editor - Johnny Lennox 
Colour Grade - Nathan Kelly
Sound Designer - Owen Brown
Please note: this is a non-profit production and any extra money made that is not used towards the film will be distributed back to the band and its members. "

462,1008489533,"When a group of zombie loving fans from the YouTube channel Scene Splice came together to make their own horror/drama, the Undead Silence web series was born. Do to the success of this web series phenomena fans have been begging for season 2 and to be honest we are equally excited. Zombie apocalypse stories are something we love to focus on and we plan on continuing that forward with your support. This time we are in need of new equipment, a camera, lighting equipment, and funding for zombie makeup and props. Season one was a success, but was unnecessarily difficult for not only the actors, but essentially every aspect of its creation, primarily editing as we struggled to make the web series/film appear more professional than its reality would entail. In season 2 we aim for ease, quick filming, and proper equipment to promise a more satisfying experience for our team, crew, and most importantly you, our audience. This is a project of love and passion from a very eager and very determined group of actors, writers, and amateur film makers that is there purely for the love of good story telling for the zombie fan audience. Help us bring to life the zombie resurrection of Undead Silence as we continue the story within an area of America where fallout exists and human mutilation is common. Together we can learn what happened and why a zombie apocalypse was the resting place for the small population of survivors after the bombs fell...
Currently the plot and screenplay are underway for this potential project, meaning that production would not begin until late fall to early spring of next year. The web series would continue for 6 - 10 months, immediately available to you to watch on our channel Scene Splice, and then ultimately becoming a film, just as the first film had done.

463,508522873," The Book was Better is a full color psychological romance graphic novel created entirely by the married artist team Alex & Kim Healey. This 1st chapter of 9 will be a printed 32 page complete story setting off the events for the full graphic novel.
Chapter 1: Synopsis
After the sudden loss of his family in an overseas plane crash, Bo retreats to the local aquarium in an attempt to distance himself from the disaster. However his worries begin to manifest, negatively distorting the way he sees the world. Seemingly by chance, he meets the bubbly Ashlyn who's very presence and odd perspective on life give the broken Bo new hope for overcoming his trauma. 
There are no villains in this story, but there is plenty of evil. There are no heroes to speak of, but plenty of people who need saving. This world is a cruel place. Each day we tell ourselves it’ll all be okay. We bury our heads from reality to keep it from getting the best of us. We tell ourselves stories to help make this life more bearable. But sometimes those stories aren’t a fair way to view the world. Sometimes those stories aren’t any good at all. Sometimes the book was better.

The Project:
Physical copies of The Book was Better chapters are Kickstarter exclusives, helping fund the creation of the full project as it progresses. Bonus content intended for the back of the final graphic novel will also be included in these issue format individual chapter releases. Funds raised go toward printing physical copies of the comic, and shipping them directly to backers, as well as funding future work on subsequent chapter development. 
Full color independent comics take a tremendous amount of time and effort to create, and something as ambitious as a graphic novel reaching nearly 300 pages is quite an undertaking. So we've decided to release by chapter to assist in funding the project as it is being created.

The Creative Team:
Alex & Kim Healey are married comic creators from Cincinnati OH. Alex is an experienced writer, inker, and letterer, whereas Kim works exclusively as the colorist. Their previous works include R, Dawn, & infiREM from Hamster Bomb Studios. They can both be found on Alex's comedy gaming YouTube channel, HamsterBomb. Links below!

The Rewards:
Backers have the opportunity to be personally thanked in the back of The Book was Better: Chapter 1, which will also carry over to the final complete Graphic Novel. They can also secure a Kickstarter exclusive printed (and even signed) copy, or choose to read the comic digitally. 
Bonus rewards include gaining access to the entire HamsterBomb library of comics digitally, and getting physical copies of the entire printed comic library along with a HamsterBomb poster and T-shirt! You can find the following comics in both bundles.
Included specifically in the HamsterBomb Digital Comics Bundle, you'll gain access to the following bonus digital comics.
Included specifically in the HamsterBomb Comics Collector Bundle, you'll also be given a HamsterBomb themed comic poster and T-shirt. The 11x17 poster features unique splash art from the comics R and Dawn. The T-shirts are available in Medium, Large, and Extra Large sizes, featuring various characters from R and Dawn.

Hi guys, I’m Ben and I am a very enthusiastic photographer and have always enjoyed photography my entire life. I recently bought my Sony NEX-7 (with the 18-200mm lens), which I will be taking to Nepal to photograph the wonderful landscape, people and wildlife. I have already traveled abroad and would say that I am experienced in travelogue photography, the project photo was taken when I was in Morocco.
I am traveling to Nepal from July to August 2014. 
My trip is split into 4 sections:
Acclimatisation
The first 2 days will be in Kathmandu getting provisions for the project as well as exploring Kathmandu. This is where I'll take close-ups of the merchants and in depth photos of the busy streets of this amazing city.
Project
For 1 week, I will be working at a secondary school just outside Pokhara. I'll be building and painting classrooms.
Trekking 
For 12 days, I will be trekking part of the Annapurna circuit, the circuit includes many rural villages and breathtaking scenery shots. The trek will begin in Bhulbhule and end in Jomson, reaching a maximum altitude of 5416m at the Thorang-la Pass. I will be staying in traditional tea houses every night. These 12 days is where I will take the majority of landscape, night-time and long exposure shots.
Rest and Relaxation 
For 4 days, I will be in Chitwan National Park for an elephant and jungle safari and canoe ride as well as a walk through the dense jungle. For the last few days, I'll be in Kathmandu, going around the busy markets and buying commercial products from the local people and might also go to Durbar Square and the Monkey Temple, as well as the Garden of Dreams and the Bodnath Stupa or swayambhunath temple. These days will most likely be city and wildlife photos.
Below are some of the photos I took in Morocco:

467,906509933,"I've been thrilled to share my Sun-Blessed Trilogy with the world, and recently I decided the story needed to be expanded. I'm nearly done with a prequel called Birth of Magic.
It's a novella (a short book, about 30% the length of Facing the Sun), and it's full of characters I think you'll adore. 
While Birth of Magic takes place in the same world as the trilogy, you can read it before or after the other books.
In the Sun-Blessed Trilogy, Kari is a nearly mythical figure, honored as the First Midwife. But before she was a legend, she was a teenager fighting for her life, her self-worth, and her child. This is her story.
I'll be providing the e-book version absolutely free, and knowing people can read it for free, I haven't been sure whether I should publish paperback copies. So it's up to you! If you'd like a paperback copy of Birth of Magic on your bookshelf,  let me know your interest by backing the Kickstarter!

Let's take an example:If we want to block javascript on every google.com domain except mail.google.com.
You can enter these two rules through the new options interface (or from the new contextual menu):
Block  *.google.com/*
Allow  mail.google.com/*
It's also working for a specific page:
Allow  https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/geddoclleiomckbhadiaipdggiiccfje
These rules follows pattern precedence, the rule with the more specific pattern takes precedence.  And that solves these issues #13 #24.
Better contextual menu
Because the most common cases are to allow/block a whole domain, a specific subdomain, or an exact url, these quick rules will be available on the context menu (right click on the QJS icon or on a page)!
And everything will be synced over your Chrome account settings
I hope you will like these new features!

To All My Dear Friends is myself, Marc Hennessey, and Greg Stull, who plays the drums while I play the violin and guitar. In order to produce a rich and emotional sound, I loop my instruments live, creating an orchestra of tones which Greg enhances with deep rhythms. A recent newspaper review described seeing To All My Dear Friends live as ""nothing short of a religious experience.""
In today 's fast-paced society, our music is here to channel emotions and offer peace of mind. Connection with emotions. Clarity through connection. We play from the heart, to the heart.
Recently, we finished recording a brand-new album. Thousands of dollars have gone into recording, mixing and mastering it, but in order to go to the presses, we need your help. Our goal is to raise $3500 for the album and the merchandise necessary to take it around the country.
Even if you can only support us with a small amount, your generosity and belief in us will make this happen. Check out all the goodies that you can grab to the right on this page, and while you're at it, please pass this page on to your friends & family via email, blogs, Facebook & Twitter.

Your help could turn this dream into a reality.   
It's time to get these amazing photographs off my computer so they can be shared with the rest of the world.   But it turns out I just can't do it alone. 
Laos 202
Originally, I planned on doing everything myself, from visiting the temples to distributing the finished book.   It has taken me three long years to swallow my pride and accept the fact that I can't do it by myself.

What I now hope to do is hand all these photographs (and the stories that go with them) over to a professional publisher and that is where I could really use some help.

I recently finished sorting through the several thousand images accumulated since 2007 but I've never published a book of photographs before.  This would be a first, and I want the quality to be as close to perfect as possible.  That is my promise to you.
Thailand 439
People tell me I'm a pretty good photographer, especially when it comes to animals, but I know now that I'm definitely not a self-publisher.  
Thailand 385
These subjects deserve to be shared with the world in their best possible light and I would rather not publish the photographs than have my name on some cheap book, you know, the kind of photo album anyone can order from one of those do-it-yourself kiosks in mall?

Here is a sampling of the over 3500 high-resolution photographs I took while backpacking through Asia.  If you would like a personally signed print of any of them, please note the country and number just below the photograph and take your pick.
Laos 526
And there is another reason I feel this project is important.   I believe the world is in trouble and people need more uplifting things to think about right now.  You don't have to be a Buddhist monk to benefit from what meditation and beautiful images can bring into your life.   As the the Dali Lama himself has often said: ""The purpose of life is to be happy.""
Thailand 121
If it's true that a picture is worth 1000 words, then in its own small way I believe this book featuring 100's of caring monks, amazing animals, and peaceful temples has the potential to change the world.   I really do as sappy as that probably sounds.
Thailand 402
In Southeast Asia, when people are unable to care for their animals, they often leave them at the temples where they know the monks and nuns will look after them.  It turns out that there are far fewer animal shelters in Asia than in most western countries.
I began photographing the animals at the temples in 2007, concentrating mainly on the temple cats.  I have been back to Asia three times since then.

The Enlightened One - Lord Buddha - instructed his followers over 2,300 years ago never to harm fellow living beings, which is why the Buddhist monks and nuns have taken vows to care for the animals left at the temples.

In addition to photography, I'm also a biochemist.    I did medical research for 10 years in Montana and California and helped clone the cystic fibrosis gene into a cell line for my Ph.D. work in 2002 (in addition to other projects).  In 2007, when my government slashed medical research funding, I took a break from science, grabbed my camera, and began traveling.

I often came across temples in Thailand situated on the banks of rivers and canals because Buddhist monks traditionally needed boats to get to them.  Southeast Asian culture is largely centered on water and Thailand even has its own 3-day water festival every April (5 days if it falls next to a weekend).

Another popular location for Buddhist temples is on the tops of mountains, which allows the ""pilgrim"" to experience a small reward after the ""sacrifice"" of making it all the way to the top.  The most challenging temple for me was near Krabi, Thailand.  I sweated so profusely while climbing up that my perspiration soaked the paper boat ticket to shreds that I had stashed away in my cloth money belt.  It was somewhat embarrassing handing it over in wet pieces as I boarded the ferry bound for Koh Phi Phi.

You know you're in the countryside of Cambodia when bicycles and water buffalo are the main sources of transportation and the green rice paddies reach all the way up to the walls of the local temple.  During the rainy season, when the rice fields are flooded, the children catch small fish in them to add protein to their family's diet.  
Thailand 811
This Buddhist nun in Krabi knew no English and my Thai was not much better, but without me asking she disappeared into her room and returned with two gorgeous cats for me to photograph.  As I later reviewed the photos to make sure I got the shot, the pride I saw on her face made all the minor irritations I often put up with -- like barking, territorial, temple dogs, salty sweat mixed with sunscreen dripping off my forehead and stinging my eyes, or having to skip both breakfast and lunch on an empty stomach -- just a distant memory.

Angkor Wat is spectacular to be sure, but most local temples in Cambodia are less well maintained in large part because the Khmer Rouge almost succeeded in wiping out Buddhism during their reign of terror in the 1970's.  There is a world of a difference (in the material sense) between the modest temples in the Cambodian countryside and the more elaborate temples you'll find at sites like Wat Phra Kaew and Wat Po in Bangkok.

In Southeast Asia, a Buddhist temple can also double as a school, a health clinic, a parking lot, a photogenic tourist attraction, a restaurant, a setting to take one's wedding vows, a day market, or simply a place to relax and escape the noises of everyday life in the city.

For equipment I used a professional Nikon D300 DSLR camera and usually favored Nikon's 10mm fisheye lens, but I also used Nikon's popular 50mm portrait lens at some temples where the light was more favorable.

I prefer natural light and almost never use a flash . . but this photographic opportunity was just too difficult to pass up.  These two calicos barely noticed the flash.
With your help, if I'm fortunate enough to surpass my funding goal, I plan to use any extra funds to purchase new lenses and a full-frame camera since one of the downsides of traveling is that my equipment takes an awful beating. "

 My Perfect Little Secret
On the first day of sophomore year, Lillian Grace Parker organizes handouts with sticky tabs, assigns different colored highlighters to each class, and loads the whole thing into a bubblegum-pink binder. Lilly’s pencil-straight brown hair and a sea of freckles feel even more annoying to her with the few extra pounds she’s gained over summer break. But Lilly never met a problem she can’t fix. As the number on the scale goes down, Lilly keeps changing her goal to a lower weight. Everything’s going even better than planned. She’s got a BFF who’s awesome, all A’s (not to mention every extra credit available), and on the soccer field, she’s scoring goal after goal. Best of all, she’s head over heels in love with Sean, the quirky, sensitive guy who sweeps her off her feet the first week of school. Then why doesn’t she feel good? Lilly thinks if she can just lose a few more pounds all her troubles will melt away. With coffee for breakfast, her favorite foods on the NO EAT list, and her dog getting fat from the scraps she’s feeding her under the table, Lilly is losing not only pounds, but herself. When Lilly collapses on the soccer field, she’s forced to make one of the biggest decisions of her life. Will she continue to lie to everyone she loves to hide her little secret and maintain her distorted version of a perfect body or will she have the courage to fight for her life and see herself for more than the reflection in the mirror?
Praise from readers: 
 “Rebecca Glenski Coppage has written an important book about a tough, sweet, real teenage girl who will steal your heart. This is a story for anyone who is or has been a teen. And anyone who eats food. “ —David Henry Sterry, bestselling author of Chicken “This book deals with a serious health problem that is prevalent in our society. In all the right places, this book does not mince words. It describes precisely the phenomenon of an altered body image.” —C.M., age 61 (whose daughter suffered from an eating disorder) 
 “It was so good. Literally one of the best books I’ve ever read.” —M.G., age 17
“As an adult who grappled with an eating disorder as a teen, I’m struck by how in-tune Rebecca Glenski Coppage is with the mindset of high school girls who fall prey to anorexia. This book is an excellent point of departure for conversation between teenagers and their parents, as the author accurately points out that even the most astute parents can miss the warning signs of eating disorders. Coppage writes this cautionary tale from the empathetic perspective of someone who clearly understands kids today and remembers what it feels like to be in high school. And she does it with an engrossing narrative that’s hard to put down.” —K.A.S. 
Kickstarter Goal:  
Get My Perfect Little Secret into the hands of teenagers everywhere!!!  The money raised with Kickstarter will pay for the printing and marketing of my book, My Perfect Little Secret.
The initial $3,000 budget covers digital servicing to Amazon and other e-retailers, promotions and my first run of 500 copies of the book, and to cost of the rewards for my awesome supporters!  My Perfect Little Secret is a necessary addition to every teenager's bookshelf!  I want to get the word out there that the novel exists and I want it to be available to all teenagers, whether it is at the bookstore or at their local library.
My Perfect Little Secret is already been professionally edited and designed by David Henry Sterry and Kim Gledhill.   If I am able to meet my kickstarter goal and exceed my initial goal, I will use any leftover money to purchase additional books, do more promoting of the book, and expand the sales into further venues.
About the author: 
 Rebecca Glenski Coppage struggled with an eating disorder from the time she was twelve until young adulthood. Now thriving and healthy, she is a pediatric intensive care nurse practitioner, a position in which she has experienced everything from being thrown up on to taking care of the sickest kids in the Midwest. Additionally, Rebecca has provided medical services on several mission trips to the Dominican Republic, where she helped operate on patients with birth defects as well as on burn victims. As a college student, she lived in Ecuador for a summer, finessing her Spanish. Other early experiences that shaped her perspective were training at the Olympic Training Center in Lake Placid for figure skating during high school, and training as a gymnast rigorously for eleven years. She also lived in a cabin with twelve 13-year-old girls as a camp counselor, which provided further insight into the teenage psyche. Rebecca credits her husband and daughter with adding great joy to her life, and they eagerly await the arrival of the newest member of their family at the end of the year. My Perfect Little Secret is Rebecca Glenski Coppage’s debut novel."

LOVECRAFT
H.P. Lovecraft has been highly influential in a number of horror films over the years.  Virtually unknown during his lifetime, being published primarily in pulp magazines, he passed away in poverty.  Posthumously, however, he has been considered to be one of the most significant 20th century writers for the horror fiction genre.
STORY
 ""The Terrible Old Man"" was written by H.P. Lovecraft in 1920.  The story follows a set of 3 criminals who come to the town of Kingsport to rob an old man who is rumoured to have a sizeable wealth of gold coins.  What the criminals don't know, due to their unfamiliarity with the region, is that the locals stay away from the old man and his house due to some... odd practices that they have noticed about him.
The Terrible Old Man expands the 3 page story into a 20 minute short film, which will give more insight into the criminals Ricci, Silva, and Czanek.
DIRECTOR
 Ryan Smith is a lifelong fan of horror films and a long-time reader of Lovecraft fiction.  He has produced and directed a number of short films successfully and continues to build his portfolio with larger and more elaborate films with each production.  For the Terrible Old Man, Ryan created the screenplay adaptation, directed the film, edited the film, and created the visual effects and color grading.
Here is a sample of Ryan's previous work (a portion of the short ""The Flashback""):

477,1855863139,"We want to find a million words that haven't been included in major English dictionaries and give them each a home on the Internet.
At Wordnik we believe that every word of English deserves to be lookupable!
The internet is, for all practical purposes, infinite. Wordnik can and should include every English word that's ever been used.
Why?
Every word deserves a recorded place in our language's history. We want to collect, preserve, and share every word of English, and provide a place where people can find, learn, annotate, comment on, and argue about every word.
If you want to know more about a word—any word!—we want to help you find the information you need. If you're curious about a word, why should you have to wait until someone else decides that a word is worth knowing?
How?
The reason so few words are added to traditional dictionaries is because writing definitions takes a long time. A very talented editor may write seven entries in a day, or she may need weeks to describe just one word. Dictionary definitions are very difficult to write. 
Wordnik takes a different approach. Instead of writing traditional definitions, we search for casual definitions that have already been created. You see these casual definitions all the time in good writing!  Here's an excellent casual definition for the word bibliobesity from Terry Teachout, in the New York Times:
""The problem of bloated books—bibliobesity, as it were—has always been with us.""
And another, for cookprint, from Consumer Reports:
""And cut down on your cookprint—the energy you use to prepare the food you eat.""
And for misophonia, by The Huffington Post:
""The condition is called misophonia—literally 'hatred of sound'—and occurs when a common noise, whether it's something like a person chewing loudly, water dripping or someone 'ahem'-ing, causes you to become anxious or angry, more so than a typical response, TODAY reported.""
Sometimes we call these self-defining, explanatory sentences ""free-range definitions"", or ""FRDs"" (pronounced ""freds"").
By finding these sentences (and we've already found a lot of them) we can help people understand new and rare words the way people normally learn new words: in context.
Why Wordnik?
Wordnik has been collecting and sharing words since 2009.
Our mission is to collect all the words of English and share them with everyone. We share words through our website at Wordnik.com, and through our API at developer.wordnik.com. Last year, we reincorporated as a non-profit, because we believe the English language belongs to everyone.
Every word at Wordnik gets its own full page, with as much data shown as possible: a standard definition (if one already exists), example sentences; synonyms, antonyms, and other related words; space for community-added tags, lists, and comments; images from Flickr and tweets from Twitter; and statistics on usage, including how many times a word has been favorited, listed, tagged, commented-upon, and, of course, whether or not it's valid in Scrabble (and how many points it scores).
Wordnik also has an open API! For web and native app developers, instead of licensing a less-complete dictionary or finding public-domain resources and adapting them, you can use our API to incorporate information from our site in search results or as full definitions.
At Wordnik, we don't want to be a gatekeeper between you and the word you're interested in; we just want to show you the data that exists and let you make up your own mind! And we want to do this for every word.
How exactly will Wordnik do this?
We'll start by taking the thousands of free-range-definition examples (FRDs, or ""Freds"") we've already found, and use those as a training set for a new machine-learning-based tool. 
We have lots of example sentences like this one!
Then we'll start looking for more great sentences, beginning with the hundreds of thousands of words that have already been looked up on Wordnik but for which we don't have good data. (If a real human looked something up, it is more likely to be interesting.)
We'll also update Wordnik so that any time a word is looked up that we've never seen before, we'll kick off a search to find more data about it.
We won't limit ourselves to words that are more frequent than one-in-a-billion, either. If a word exists at all, we'll show you what we can! 
A million words missing from dictionaries? How can there be that many?
In 2010, Harvard researchers published findings in the journal Science that began to quantify the number of definition-less words in English. Using the Google Books Corpus (5 million books, 361 billion words) and comparing samples to major dictionaries (including the Oxford English Dictionary [OED] and the Merriam-Webster Unabridged Dictionary [MWD]), the researchers estimated that ""52% of the English lexicon—the majority of the words used in English books—consists of lexical 'dark matter' undocumented in standard references.""
Jean-Baptiste Michel, Erez Lieberman Aiden, and the other authors of the Science paper defined a word as a meaningful string of letters that occurs more often than once every billion words. (1 in a billion is the frequency of the least common words in the dictionaries they analyzed.) Using this definition, they used their data to estimate that the English language contains 1,022,000 words—each of which appeared at least 362 times in their 361 billion word dataset.
The second edition of the OED has 615,100 ""word forms defined and/or illustrated""; MWD has around 470,000 main entries (not including word forms).
Once you take into account words that appear less frequently than once every billion words, there may be a million or more missing words!
Do we really need all these words?
We already have all these words in English! They exist right now in articles, books, blog posts, and even tweets. But they've never all been recorded in one place where they can be discovered and loved.
Have you ever felt that the right word was out there, but you just couldn't find it? 
Have you ever learned a weird word that made your whole day? Perhaps a word like thoil, which means 'to be able to justify the expense of a purchase'? Or pandiculation, which means 'yawning and stretching (as when first waking up)'?
Many of these missing words aren't words we use every day, but their existence enriches the whole language. We believe every word should have the right to be included in the dictionary.
At Wordnik, we want to gather data about every word—and then you can use that data to decide whether a word is worth adding to your vocabulary. We'll just find the words: what happens next is up to you!
What Will Backers Get?
In addition to adding all these new words to Wordnik for everyone to enjoy, we will be releasing a report to backers in March of 2016 detailing our progress and giving an overview of the words we've found and added. Every backer will receive this (digital) report.
We have some other splendiferous rewards, too!
RANDOM BACKER: for one measly greenback, you can be a random word adopter. We'll add your name to a ""random sponsor"" list that will display one random sponsor's name every time someone clicks the ""Random Word"" link at Wordnik.com. We'll also choose one random backer to receive all the other under-$500 rewards!
WE ❤️ STICKERS BACKER: At $10, we'll send you a complete set of Wordnik stickers, plus a sticker conferring membership in the Semicolon Appreciation Society. We'll also add a ""Backer"" badge to your Wordnik profile page.

We'll tweet about your adoption to Wordnik's wordy followers (more than nineteen thousand of them!), and we'll also add an ""Adopter"" badge to your Wordnik profile page. Words are first-come, first-served, so back early!
YOU DESERVE A MEDAL!: Seriously. For helping Wordnik and adopting a word, backers at the $45 level will get an honest-to-goodness backer medal, plus all the Adopt a Word rewards!

Your donation is tax-deductible!
Wordnik is a non-profit effort. For US backers, your donation is tax-deductible and may also qualify for matching funds from your employer if they support such a program for charitable contributions. While we file for our own non-profit status we have teamed up with a well-known 501(c)3 fiscal sponsor, Planetwork (they were also the fiscal sponsor for Hypothes.is). For any contributions you make you will receive a letter from Planetwork/Wordnik verifying that your contribution qualifies as tax-deductible.
How Will We Spend This Money?
A rough breakdown
Our biggest expenses for this project are adding the extra servers and storage to find, process, and serve data for a million (or more!) new words. Although we believe we can be more efficient than our current setup, we're basing our costs on what we spend now to run Wordnik's servers now.  
We also are hiring some amazing machine learning consultants to ensure that we're doing this The Right Way. (We expect to make their names public very shortly after launch of the campaign.)
We also will be spending a little money to make cool stuff to reward our backers, and and, of course, there are Kickstarter fees.
Wait, What Do You Mean By ""Word""?
This is a very good question! Linguists, lexicographers, and grammarians often struggle with what makes something ""a word"". Here are some types of words that are A-OK with us and that we will include when we find them:
Nonce-words (words used just once)
Affixes (prefixes and suffixes), and words created by adding affixes to existing words
Fixed phrases and idioms
Words borrowed from other languages and not yet considered naturalized in English by other dictionaries, but used by English speakers and writers.
Here are some things we DON'T consider ""words"" for the purposes of this project:
obvious typos or OCR errors. Of course, then you have to figure out what's ""obvious"" ... we'll be looking at words that are very similar to existing words and show up in identical contexts, e.g.:
keysmash, e.g. asjdlkfjasdf. We'll be doing some filtering to see if new strings we find are ""shaped"" like English words.
Emoji(s). Sorry! Go look them up at Emojipedia.
Even More Things To Look At!

Occult Ornithology- A bird themed tarot deck
The aim of this Kickstarter is to fund a 22 card major arcana tarot deck, themed around birds as the tarot trump cards. The structure of the deck is based on the Rider-Waite  tarot deck from 1910, partially because I am most familiar with this deck and because the meanings and imagery in that deck seemed like a natural fit for an ornithological deck. The deck will come with gold edges as well as gold foiling on the front and back of the cards, I also want to beautifully finished guide book to accompany the deck. 
The Moon- Lyrebird, The Sun- Waldrapp, Judgement- Barn Owl
Why birds?  Folktales, feelings and archetypes have been associated with many species of birds across every culture since spoken word. The various associations we make with many species and mythologies surrounding them make them a perfect fit for the tarot. On top of this, the rich biodiversity of birds as well as our own unique feelings surrounding various species lend themselves well to both structured reading of the cards and allow for the personal interpretation of the reader allowing for a rich deck. 
Book cover idea
Many of my previous backers and people who follow me across various social media are aware of my affinity to birds and fascination with the species both from a spiritual and biological standpoint. Creating this tarot has given me the space to explore various species and allowed me to let my passion shine through in every card. In the accompanying book for the deck, you will not only have the meaning of the card for every tarot, but you will also have an explanation of why the bird was chosen and also a small piece about the depicted species. 
The Chariot- Canada Geese, Temperance- Lesser Flamingo, Strength- Kea
Why a tarot deck? The tarot have always fascinated me, I bought my first deck when I was 15 and made my own velvet bag for the cards. Going through the cards and studying the art and meaning in each one was always a great pleasure and comfort to me.  In later years, developing my styles and interests i've had many requests form people to design a deck, it wasn't until I sat and thought about the kind of deck that I personally felt was missing from my own collection that I realised that I would love to create a bird themed tarot deck!
Justice- Carrion Crow
What's in the Deck? The deck will consist of the 22 major arcana only, I made this decision because I wanted to create quite a simple deck with more streamlined meanings. I also felt that the iconography of the birds would be watered down in a traditional 78 card deck, I wanted the 22 birds to speak for themselves. The deck will have beautiful gold foiling on both the front and back of the cards, as gold edges and will be printed onto high quality 350gsm card stock. When designing this deck I decided that I wanted the finish to be a luxurious as possible, the deck is both designed as a working tarot and as a beautiful item to own. The box will be be book shaped with a magnetic lid to keep your deck secure and stored beautifully.
The cards
Birds represented in the deck:
 The Fool-White Stork
 The Magician- Satin Bowerbird
 The High Priestess- Great Crested Grebe
 The Emperor- King Vulture
 The Hierophant- Onagadori Rooster
 The Lovers- Rock Doves
 The Chariot- Canada Geese
 Justice- Carrion Crow
 The Hermit- Grey Heron
 The Wheel- Cuckoo and Wood Thrush
 Strength- Kea
 The Hanged Man- Ring-necked Pheasant

 The Tower- Great Black-backed Gull
 The Star- Mistle Thrush 
 The Moon- Superb Lyrebird 
 The Sun- Waldrapp (Northern Bald Ibis)
 Judgement- Barn Owl
 The World- Wandering Albatross 


The deck is also accompanied by the 48 page guide, this 15x15cm book will be perfect bound with a foiled cover and full colour throughout. This book will serve both as a detailed guide to each of the cards, but also as a guide to birds. All of the cards will have a detailed explanation to what the card is, what it represents, why the bird has been chosen and information about that bird species. I want to bring together my natural love of both art and the natural world.

So, why £6000?
To date this is the most i've ever asked for in a Kickstarter, with previous projects i've started by asking for the baseline to what I would need to bring the basic product to backers! In this case, while it would be tempting to ask for £3000 and scrap the Foil fronts and backs, and do a small booklet to accompany the deck I feel that I want to bring out the deck exactly how I envisioned it with the detailing that I personally love in other decks and pieces of art that I own. Because of this,  the cost to print 500 copies of the deck will be £3200 alone, the book will be an additional £1020, . The additional £2000 will cover Kickstarter fees, taxes and postage and packaging. I feel that this number is exactly what I require to bring the best version of the deck that I can. 
As with all my Kickstarters, any extra funding will go back directly to my backers in the form of stretch goals. 
The Devil- Eurasian Magpie
The fun bit, Stretch goals:
£8,000- I will design another exclusive print for all backers-  UNLOCKED- backers preferred more choice in prints so now there are an extra 3 prints to choose from, all backers also receive a foil bookmark!

The Artist
At MCM comic con Birmingham last year!
My name is Katie and i'm a Liverpool based illustrator. I regularly attend comic cons and sell my wares, I have met many of my previous backers at these events! My artwork is mostly nature informed horror art, but I also dabble in scientific and conservation art, as you can see from my picture, the 2 subjects very much go hand in hand! 
Memento Mori
I've been combining the occult and nature for a while now, my previous artwork was a collection of my horror artworks and the connection between my interests was clear throughout the book. The project also allowed me to dabble in foiling and other print techniques which I will be applying to Occult Ornithology!
Owllustrations, pidgeonary (previously on kickstarter!) Seagulls: a cliff note and Baneful Herbs zines!
I've always been interested in educating people about nature, but also trying to represent the beauty in it. As you can see from the zines i've worked in over the years there is a big emphasis on birds especially, chances are if you meet me in real life i'll probably roll out a ton of bird facts at you! Compiling that knowledge and applying it to the tarot has been so much fun for me, i've not only picked birds that I adore but i've also picked birds that I felt get little attention in media but still represent so much. 
Bird nerd!
Occult Ornithology is a dream project for me, I feel that the artwork and content of the cards is an accumulation of knowledge and skill from years of practice and exhibiting my work. I hope my personal connection to birds and love for creating shines through the project! I can't wait to share it with you all :)"
480,1820520716,"    One day my 15 year old daughter and I were discussing what could something fun that doest exist ye  I  said to her when I was her age My friends and I made our own fun.  We played a lot of shenanigans , harmless stuff but we had fun,  There wasn't computers jn our houde because they were reserved for rich people and its not like it is today.  But the moral of the stories I told her about was to go out and make your own fun.  So we racked our brains and came up with the idea of this viral video-game and scavenger hunt.  This game would be called Twist of Fate and you would need a smart phone or a camera that takes video and a computer.  This game would be a cross between a scavenger hunt and challenges that you would complete.  It would range from doing a karaoke video to a quick note on why your family is the best.  You would use your smart phone to take video and pictures of doing the challenges and for the written challenges there would be a form on the app/webpage.  Each game I pick the top 10 ten and members who played vote on the the top ten.  At first the games will be around a month in between then it will eventually go weekly and finally daily.   Kickstarter has very strict rules about providing prizes for the game so officially There are no prizes except bragging rights at least until I'm done with kickstarted.   
        The money raised from this kickstarted project will be put to use on building a website which ranges from 90,000 to 130,000.  Personel costs for web developers, and other key personel.  Web apps cost between 30,000 to 60,000 each and there are 3. The cost of the webpage and bandwidth.  Some computer equipment.  Cost of advertising.  Lawyer fees and taxes. 
THIS IS A CREATIVE ARTS WEBPAGE AND APPS SO REMEMBER TO BE YOURSELF    EVERYTHING IS IN ALL GOOG FUN.  I EVENTUALLY PLAN TO RIVAL YOUTUBE

481,1441706282,"The Project
After forming Velvet Caravan organically almost two years ago, we have decided to record an album capturing the essences of our unique style. Gypsy, Gypsy-Jazz, Honky-Tonk, Latin and Swing seem like an impossible musical combination, but after many months of playing together, an interesting sound has evolved.  The style can be called a lot of things, but we always seem to best describe it as European Redneck Music.  
This CD was recorded within three evenings with Kevin Rose, owner of Elevated Basement Recording Studio and the chief sound & recording engineer for the internationally-acclaimed Savannah Music Festival.  Not ones to do things traditionally, we recorded all the songs onstage at Savannah's historic Lucas Theatre.  The natural acoustic environment (designed specifically for non-amplified instruments) proved essential in capturing the high energy of our live performances onto this album.
We are seeking your support to complete this project before the end of the year (2013). By contributing to any of the rewards listed on this page, you will not only help us finish the project but also have the benefit of hearing the album before its release date in 2014, in addition to other awesome perks.
Our above video - though longer than others - is a work of art in itself by the talented Peter Marra of Savannah's 1M Studios and beautifully showcases the story behind the coming together of our unique group.  
We hope you enjoy, and your support truly means a lot to us.

485,526833568,"We’re on a mission to reduce the risk of charity fraud and increase support for programs rescuing children and families from poverty.
We seek $10,000 to complete software that can distinguish a good charitable investment from a bad risk, instantly.   
Each year, we shell out more than $500 billion in charitable donations and taxpayer contributions for human services. 
How much of this money improves child and family well-being for good vs. for now? 
How much is likely to uplift children and families from poverty and reduce our taxpayer spending on social services? 
What’s a good baseline for the return on investment we should expect our dollars to yield? 
Getting answers to these and other market-value questions, helpful to reducing the risk of charitable giving and ensuring a bigger bang for our buck, is here. 
We, at Saint Wall Street, have designed an online calculator that will assess the value of the difference a social program makes, by analyzing and monetizing its officially reported performance data. The cost-benefits and return-on-investment findings will reveal the extent to which that program professing to improve child and family well-being is likely producing lasting social change, sustainable economic growth, and a good financial return on investment for all, including the families, communities and investors. 
It is important to note that the calculator will not enable making donations, nor recommend any social programs for support. Its sole purpose is to provide reliable market-value standards and measures that can be used to inform wiser program planning decisions and program funding decisions, to ensure better outcomes for children and families. 
America’s first-ever Philanthropic Return on Investment (PROI) calculator is in its final stages of development. Your support will help get it to market. Here’s a sample demonstration of the PROI calculator’s functionality.
The PROI calculator will be customized for use via philanthropic, nonprofit, and academic institutions -- some of which are awaiting the final product, right now. Funding will cover technology expertise for completion, professional services to ensure proper functionality and to double-check data and formulas, and initial website development for hosting and pre-market testing.

One of my very first memories is being in my father's recording studio as a toddler. I began playing guitar when I was nine and I formed my first band in high school. When I was 22, my band was signed to a record deal and we continued to travel and build a following throughout the Northwest.
As any artist will tell you, it takes years to develop one's craft. I continue to work every day to master my instrument, my singing and my songwriting. I have collected a few amazing mentors along the way and now I am at a crossroads. Everything has lead up to this extraordinary opportunity that allows me to express my artistry in a way that I’ve never been able to before.
With many shifting tides in the music industry and the music delivery method, you now have the ability to do what a record label used to do. This is the first time in history where you can be involved with the recording process.
I am thrilled to announce my dream-come-true project: the pinnacle of years’ worth of work – MY NEW ALBUM.
Over the last few years, I’ve had the incredible opportunity to collaborate with the legendary David Crosby on his first solo album in 20 years. Now, some of the same renowned musicians will be working with me on my new album. I have a collection of new songs (some written with David Crosby and his son, LA musician and producer James Raymond), and an innovative approach that will undoubtedly lead to the best sonic sensation I have ever created.  
The money generated from this campaign will fund my new recording. (studio time, musicians fees, art, photography, printing costs, hard drives, mastering, etc.) Any additional funding will go towards album promotion and touring.
In return for your generous contributions, you will receive some really cool incentives and have the opportunity to join me for what will assuredly be a fun and very memorable experience. 
Please feel free to write me to create custom high level rewards.
I am very thrilled to have your backing on this project and I can't wait for you to hear the results!

490,476303073,"More about  ""Juicy body""
My body’s so juicy! It can be naked, it can be dressed in silk or leather. It needs a lot of space because it is so juicy. My body has different smells, it can smell differently, taste differently. Many different fluids can come out of it. And at the same time that it does all these things, it also carries so many feelings within. My body’s elastic, it can make all sorts of moves, and transform if I want it to transform. It needs no criticism, ‘cause there’s only one like it, it’s a unique example. One edition, not for sale.
""Juicy body"", 2015
For more than a decade I’ve been working with self-portrait, staging my body in front of the camera. During the last four years I’ve been shooting with the book Juicy Body in mind. I’ve developed my own way of working and have come to a place where my intention aligns with my expression. This process has produced a body of work that constitutes a fierce and playful book, one that reaches out to a broader audience – a queer manifesto for the female body. 
The book consists of forty photographs in color. Each picture shows a body in nature. The body prepares itself to run into the mist wearing a green bathing suit, stands in a lake dressed in golden shorts, or moves under a fullmoon directing a flashlight towards itself. Together the images create a collection of stills in which the subject is presented in a sometimes humoristic and sometimes vulnerable way, but always an active one. This body is continuously relating to an imaginary audience. 
All images are taken with an analogue middle format-camera. I act behind as well as in front of the camera, with help from a self-timer connected to a remote-control that can be fired off by standing on it or holding it. This is a perfect method for playing with being in or out of control, exploring everything that my body’s been taught and responds to when a camera enters the scene. 
In addition to my photographs, the book will consist of a foreword about my work, written by an artcritic, as well as a few short texts written by myself about the moment when five of the specific images were taken. “Juicy body” already has a printer (Livonia), and will be published by Black Book Publishing. It will also be ready for my opening at YA Gallery in Stockholm on the 5th of oktober 2017, and will be launched at the bookstore Konst-ig during the same week.
""Gotta get in gotta get out"", 2015
In october 2017 eight pictures from ""Juicy body"" will be exhibited in large scale at NAU Gallery in Stockholm. My idea is to have the book ready for the opening, as a possibility for the audience there as well as outside the gallery room to see more of my work. I know there's a lot of people out there who's been following my work for a long time. And for me this book will definitely be an opportunity for me to reach out to an even broader audience.
Together I'm convinced we can make this happen!
The book
WIth your support, we will create a high-quality book with a release-date in oktober 2017. I've chosen the best 35 pictures from four years of work for this exclusive book, that will be printed in an edition of 500 at Livonia Print, published at Black book Publications. 
NOTE: Book pictured is a digital mock-up, final version will differ.
  Hello!
About Casia Bromberg
Casia Bromberg (b. 1984) is a visual artist based in Stockholm, Sweden. She graduated from the University of Photography/in Gothenburg, Sweden in 2011. She works mainly with photography, often together with text and sound. Central to her work is the use of her own body, as well as her friends’ bodies, to raise questions about human relationships, sexuality, socially constructed gender, and ideas about ""the staged"" and ""the authentic"". She explores what it means to be in control or self-aware in our time, by playing with stereotypes and identification. The suggestive narrative and movement in the images charge her work with excitement and a sense of self-empowerment.

492,1393184760,"When I was a kid, I always loved those ""Choose your own adventure"" books. I remember reading them and getting so excited that I could really choose how the story goes.
Now that I'm older, I wanted to bring this idea to the mobile front. 
I've found some friends and their friends knew some people and this sounded like it could actually be done. 
The writer I found has written some pilots and other interesting stuff for Hollywood and his writing style ended up being perfect for this story. 
This writer knew some graphics designers and also some music composers. Together, we have been able to gather nearly all the requirements for this game, such as background music, loading music and even death music!
The graphic artist was able to custom draw several art work pieces that will go in the game, and several that wont make the cut just due to so many pieces of art.
Some Sample Art Work
Another sample, animated
We have little features like timed choices in the game, as well as special inventory items you can find that will help with certain parts of the story.
It is a very simple, but fun and engaging game. You read what is on the screen, and you are presented with options to choose that relate to that you have just read. Depending on your choice, you will see new text to read. There are many dead ends and fun little surprises.
Here is a little example: 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The river narrows even more, sloshing up the sides of the cave on both sides. An enormous boulder takes up most of the space ahead of you, splitting the river left and right. The left is violent. Whitewater splashes everywhere. Foam hangs on the rocks. The right looks calmer, but sounds louder. You can't see far enough to know.
You have 10 seconds to choose or a choice will be made for you:
Paddle Left?Paddle Right?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You give yourself up to fate and slide past the door. Hopefully, it won't be the last light you see for too long – or for, you know – ever. 
It isn't. The slide gradually becomes less steep, and then it shoots you into a new, well-lit room from a hole near the ceiling. You fall a few feet and skin your elbows on the floor, but you're just fine. What did the door you passed up lead to, though? You get the feeling you'll wonder about that for a long time. 
Whatever. You take a look around. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For being a supporter of any amount, you will automatically get the paid version for free. The paid version enables you to go back after you make a choice you did not like. In the free version, if you die or make a mistake in your choice, you will need to start over.
We are so excited to finish this project. This is where you come in. We are trying to raise a little bit of funding so we can get this finished quickly.
We plan to deliver version 1.0 before Christmas, 2014.

In order to finalize the tracks they must be mastered, this allows the songs to be playable on the radio and in any commercial format necessary, but this is an expensive task that must be done by mastering professionals. I have the opportunity of working with some of the best mastering professionals in the business for relatively cheap prices. I plan to spend 800$ on the masters and then the rest 700$ on fees to properly press and make the album covers. Once done, everyone who has helped with pledges of 25$ or more will receive their own album plus extras such as a live recording of a LoverCraft show and if there is enough time and money possibly the first series of LoverCraft T-shirts."
494,1597757445,"Thank you to our amazing supporters, who are making this happen! Any additional money raised above our goal will also go directly to our production costs. After the completion of our Kickstarter our team will continue to write grants, and approach foundations interested in supporting public health projects, so let's keep up the great work over our last few days  and shoot for a new ""stretch goal"" of $55,000! 
How would you live your life if you discovered that you had an incurable disease? This is the question we explore in this poignant documentary about the women who are living with stage 4 metastatic breast cancer.
Approximately 30% of women with breast cancer will ultimately have the disease spread and will receive the Metastatic Breast Cancer diagnosis. There is no cure. In the last 40 years, the MBC death toll has not changed significantly, nor has the mean survival rate of three years. Despite early detection, awareness campaigns, and new treatments, we are still losing about 40,000 women a year to this disease. Those numbers need to drop. 
This three-part documentary series will look at the journey of the women who have this disease, the researchers and physicians who are trying to cure it, and the youngest generation that is at risk and is fighting for more funding and better treatment. Our team has unique access to a remarkable group of women at the Huntsman Cancer Institute in Utah, and now we want to spend time with other groups of breast cancer patients in diverse regions of the country. 
We are hoping to raise $50,000 to continue working on this film in other locations. We will use the funding to complete an additional 20-25 days of filming in more rural areas of the South and on the East Coast. It will also help us to pay for a professional editor. If we don’t reach our goal, we won’t get any of the funds we raise, so please share this link and donate today in memory of someone you know who’s died from breast cancer, in honor of someone who’s a survivor, or for someone that you hope never gets breast cancer. 
Monthly support group for women with stage 4 breast cancer.
Part One: In Salt Lake City, Utah, a monthly support group for women with stage 4 breast cancer was started in December 2015 by an oncology team. The team consists of a social worker and a breast cancer physician who recognized that there were not enough resources specifically for women with metastatic breast cancer. The women in the group exchange bucket list ideas, talk about how to help their families cope with grief, discuss the process of dying, and talk about their own funerals. Two of women have widespread disease in a variety of organs. A few have it in just one organ and continue to look for the best possible treatment options. Others have disease that progresses significantly from month to month. We get to know four of the patients in more depth at home, with their families, and through their cancer treatments. Through intimate interviews, archival materials, and vérité footage, the role of protagonist shifts from one woman to the next as their lives intersect. As time progresses, we learn more about our characters' home lives, their experiences in the workforce, and the realities of living with a deadly disease.

Lisa Gauchay, the oncology social worker that started the monthly breast cancer support group.
Lisa Gauchay, LCSW, is an oncology social worker at the Huntsman Cancer Institute who started the monthly metastatic breast cancer group. One of her patients who had widespread triple negative breast cancer at the age of 33 said that she “was the Komen Foundation’s worst nightmare with a disease that had no cure."" Lisa was determined to do more for the women with metastatic breast cancer and felt as though a support group was a good way for these women to come together through their common experiences.

Dr. Saundra Buys, is focused on providing top-notch clinical treatment as well as focusing on her patients' emotional well-being.
Dr. Saundra Buys co-facilitates the groups with Lisa. Recognizing the difficult diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer, and having a sister and a daughter who are breast cancer survivors, Dr. Buys is a compassionate health care provider who is invested in providing top-notch clinical treatment while also focusing on her patients' emotional well-being at the renowned Huntsman Cancer Institute.

Part Two: Two thousand miles away in Boston, MA; Washington, DC; and Birmingham, Alabama, we watch different kinds of support for breast cancer patients unfold. Located in the heart of the metropolitan city of Boston are women who have different life challenges and battles. We meet two stage 4 breast cancer patients two weeks before they go to their MBC retreat. One lives in Jamaica Plains and is working two jobs while raising her two young sons as a single mother. The other lives in Quincy, Massachusetts, with her two sisters and mother. We follow these women as they participate in an all-expenses-paid two-day MBC retreat in rural Maine and connect with eight other women from across the country with stage 4 breast cancer.

The mortality rates for breast cancer are higher for African-Americans in Alabama and Mississippi.
In rural areas of Alabama and Mississippi, we are hoping to follow an outreach team at The Deep South Network for Cancer Control through the UAB Cancer Center. This NCI-designated facility is a nationally recognized leader in cancer education, research, and patient care. The Center is also a leader in community outreach, most notably for work in increasing education and awareness of cancer in minority and underserved populations. The mortality rates for breast cancer are higher for African-Americans in Alabama and Mississippi, and the Center's Deep South Network for Cancer Control seeks to eliminate such health disparities - particularly in rural areas - and provide access to these populations.

The UAB Cancer Center is a nationally recognized leader in cancer education, research, and patient care.
Artistic production notes on Part Two: We have reached out to five potential locations for the second phase of filming: Boston, MA; Washington, DC; Baltimore, MD; New York, NY; and Birmingham, AL. Based on the response from cancer retreats and top cancer hospitals, our team is confident that we will have the opportunity to follow these subjects and health care teams. Funding we receive through this project will support filming in these new areas.

Part Three: As women from Salt Lake City, UT, and Boston, MA, with MBC advocate for more research, better insurance coverage, and additional social-emotional resources, Dr. Saundra Buys works with multigenerational families in the High Risk Breast Cancer Clinic. Over a fifteen-year period, the HRBCC enrolled more than 1,500 individuals from 256 families, collecting data and biospecimens that have been made available for research. Internationally, over 30,000 individuals from nearly 12,000 families have contributed data and/or biospecimens to this valuable resource that has resulted in hundreds of publications and research projects. We see young women who have lost mothers and other relatives to MBC enroll in the study and move forward in their lives. We look at how they reconcile their own risk factors and face their futures.

Barb, her husband, and their three daughters
Artistic production notes on Part Three: We have reached out to three potential locations for the third phase of filming – we hope to follow two multigenerational families at two High Risk Breast Cancer Clinics. Our first location is at the Huntsman Cancer Institute, and the other two options are at Mount Sinai or Columbia University in NY.  Based on the response from these two cohort sites, the medical facilities believe that our creative team will have the opportunity to follow an additional family or two who are at high risk for MBC.   

Over 30,000 individuals from nearly 12,000 families have contributed data and/or biospecimens to The High Risk Breast Cancer Clinics.

497,1163350526,"In today's day and age computers,cellphones, and social media rule everything which is great and terrible all at the same time. It's great because you can acquire and share vast amounts of information within minutes versus forty years ago when it took days to find out what was happening across the globe. On the other hand, it has its downfalls. The world is a very large place with an endless amount of sights and activities to see and do. People are missing out on all of the great things this planet has to offer by being distracted by social media and other sources of electronic entertainment. What if there was a way to combine the two and subliminally get people back into the outdoors? A place where anyone involved in the outdoors can come, share their ideas, tips, tricks, and experiences with other like minded individuals. Facebook is great, don't get me wrong, but I don't relate to half of the things that roll trough my news feed on a daily basis so it gets a bit annoying after a while. This will be a place where all of the information you need relating to the outdoors  will be easily accessible. Information regarding hunting, hiking, fishing, camping, scuba diving, mountain climbing, mountain biking, snow and water sport activities, gun enthusiasm, and much more.  Information such as the state park locations, hours fees, and activities, areas of interest both state side and abroad, all hunting and fishing information worldwide subdivided into seasons, license costs, game fish and animals, and bag limits, outdoor activities and events and a timeline schedule so you don't miss a tournament, group hike, scuba session, or downhill race, world events and news such as new world records and crazy catches related to the outdoors, plus all of the information the other club members will be bringing to the table and sharing. You will be surrounded by people who share the same interests as you so you will always be able to find something new and fascinating that you can relate to. We can even sub divide it so you are completely surrounded by people who are in the exact same field of interest as you. On top of the vast information relating to all aspects of the outdoors there will be a store that will allow members and non-members to acquire the gear they need to pursue interests in the outdoors. Club members will also receive a discount on gear. To top it all off we will have seasonal and monthly competitions and giveaways. Take for example whoever submits the most extraordinary scenic mountain climb photo will receive free climbing gear, or at the beginning of bass season we promote a largest bass caught competition. If you win you will receive a free bass set up with lures and a box. After all that said we will offer what no other outdoor company offers, excursions with the team. Every year we will have a different outdoor excursion so we can relate to all of our members. With every purchase of X amount your name will be put into a hat and at the end of the drawing date up to 5 club members will be going on an all inclusive excursion with the Outdoorsman team. I truly believe that this is something the world could definitely use, it would connect more like minded people than ever before and it will be a great new source of information for new and existing outdoor men, women and children."

Hi. I'm Laura, a cultural education designer. When I was very young, I realized there were lots of different cultures, and no matter which one we lived in, it was fun & inspiring to participate in someone else's.
~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~Our Boys & Girls Need ZoomerangKidz~~~~~~~~~~~~
In 77% of US households someone owns a Smartphone and due to that 43% of the children are using one. 65% of children are using a Smartphone on a daily basis, 28% weekly and 6% less often. These figures are very likely to increase in the future.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~All I Really Need to Know~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The saying, ""All I really need to know I learned in Kindergarten"" is true today in a new way. Teachers stretched for time and resources are barely able to teach core curriculum in diverse classrooms, much less find ways to bridge cultural and gender gaps. I am creating ZoomerangKidz Adventures for mobile to inspire girls and boys to take an interest in the world around them, to be adventurous and brave whatever their gender or cultural background, at home and in school.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~A New World Perspective~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When I consulted in schools I delivered ZoomerangKidz Adventures to numerous classes where hundreds of children 5 to 9 participated. The project happened in classes, yet many smartphones and tablets were in the hands of children at home. Teachers and parents found mobile content distracting children away from classroom learning. Today, boys in particular are losing interest in school as early as 8, in favor of playing games. Too many boys relate to games as meaningful, and to school as being ""for girls"". More girls are playing mobile games, but again, parents say most content is fluff and filled with gender stereotypes. We can change that now.
~~~~~~What is the Difference this New World Story makes?~~~~~~~
Children 5 to 9 are curious, shy and excited to learn what is outside their neighborhoods. ZKz opens the world so the sparks stay lit.
Games that boys relate to as meaningful, that also provide core curriculum within the adventure, help them stay dialed into school.
Games where girl characters take the same risks as boy characters increases girls' interests in subject areas that may be seen as for boys, like science, math & engineering.
When all children have a tool that enables them to explore the greater world, they rise to the occasion. Children want to expand their reach. ZKz is expansive storytelling merged with core curriculum, built to keep them feeling interconnected & motivated to keep learning as they grow past 3rd grade.
The world is shrinking. Children need to be culturally savvy to succeed.
Children in this age segment believe they can make a difference, and they believe it wholeheartedly as they master their Universe, one culture at a time, when they enter ZoomerangKidz Adventure Series.
How the App & Cartoon Series can Make a Difference for Everyone
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ZKz Characters Break Stereotypes~~~~~~~~~~
Children help save the Zoomerangians from extinction. Part of the knowledge they gain as the game expands shows them the state of this planet and how they can make a difference in it. See what Zemi sees, explore with her, or choose Isabella, Dozer or Widget. They are from diverse backgrounds, adventurous and daring! ZKz entertains children and their families by providing:
1) Games where there is something important to solve, with risks and rewards.
2)  Humorous YouTube Cartoons that are part of a bigger story and hold clues to the games
3) Engaging characters to root for and identify with, that break through gender and cultural stereotypes & biases.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~This is how we are going to do it~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Big Story - Helping save Zoomerangians from extinction through collecting knowledge is created up to a point, and has lots of room to grow. Come grow with us! The Apps are designed.

Aldo, is a strange and adorable creature who the children meet during a routine walk through the forest.  After meeting Aldo the children learn that his species, the Zoomerangians® are becoming extinct.  Aldo explains that he needs help collecting Power Gems called ZoomBlooms® …
“Yes,” Aldo explains. “Zoomerangians eat (actually absorb) ZoomBlooms … and ZoomBlooms are getting harder to find.”
Aldo continues, “The extract that comes from deeply focusing and learning something new is the power of the Universe.  It is this extract, present in ZoomBlooms, that keeps Zoomerangians alive.”
“And now, since ZoomBlooms are getting harder to find, my fellow Zoomerangians are in danger of becoming extinct”
The children want to help.  They ask where they can find these ZoomBlooms.
Aldo explains, “Well, learning in and about new cultures brings the most power to ZoomBlooms.  So, the best way to find ZoomBlooms is to travel around the globe and explore the world’s cultures and gain knowledge of…
Aldo responds … “Don’t worry about traveling thousands of miles.  These ZoomPlumes® will help you in your travels.”
Then, Aldo gifts the children with ZoomPlumes®, magical feathers which give the children super hero powers and enhances their personal strengths.
And this is the just the beginning ... Our average elementary school age children are now the ZoomerangKidz Adventurers!
These ZoomerangKidz travel the globe collecting all sorts of knowledge from the places and cultures they visit (that is, they learn stuff). As the kids learn they are rewarded with ZoomBlooms that nourish the Zoomerangians. With each new fact the adventurers move one step closer to saving Aldo and the Zoomerangians … A Zoomerangian Revival!.
The ZoomerangKidz Adventures® is a series of YouTube Cartoons and companion mobile game apps, for 5 to 9 year olds, designed to enrich childhood playtime with mobile content that is fun and engaging. ZoomerangKidz creatively enables kids to
Go to cities, states, and locations around the world
Experience the history, landmarks and actually feel the culture each of these locations offer
Play entertaining educationally relevant games ... The players learn about the world they live in
The ZoomerangKidz Adventures® is a series of YouTube Cartoons and companion Mobile App games (Transmedia). Each episode in the series consists of one YouTube Cartoon and one Mobile App Game. 
The YouTube Cartoon tells a story of ZoomerangKidz Adventures exploring a world culture.  The Mobile App Game allows the players (our kids) to interactively explore and play games that enhance and reinforce the YouTube Cartoon Story.
The Mobile App game is built around a map that the kids explore to collect knowledge.  They may sometimes just pick up ""knowledge"" (e.g., artifacts) as they explore; other times they may play knowledge enhancing mini-games.  As the kids collect knowledge they receive ZoomBlooms, which in turn, help the Zoomerangians.
The ZoomerangKidz Adventures Cartoons and Mobile App Games go together.
The YouTube Cartoons provide context and clues for the games.
The games enable players to interactively explore in the same setting presented by the YouTube Cartoon.
As we add ZoomerangKidz episodes, the virtual game board expands until, ultimately, it includes the entire globe.  In the process, children thread facts about the real world and deepen their understanding of their own and other cultures. 
The ZK Adventures global virtual game board will be displayed on the ZK web site.Children will be able to track the progress of the Zoomerangian Revival by viewing this global virtual game board.
Saving the Zoomerangian Species from extinction, Exploration, Play, and even Learning always bring the children back to the Series.
There are plenty of locations and cultures to explore in our world (and even in other worlds).The possibilities are endless.
Each Episode explores a new location ... A new culture. The children explore landmarks, wildlife, flora & fauna, agriculture, clothing, food, animals, languages, music and geography receiving a deep, diverse cultural experience. Math, science and reading are also woven into the experiences.
ZoomerangKidz merges game-play with the cultural content of the companion cartoon, core school curriculum, and problem solving.  By so doing, the ZoomerangKidz Adventures enable a deeper understanding of the similarities within your child’s own culture and other cultures around the world.
It makes sense to turn children's media time into a high-quality, creative learning experience. This is our goal.  Our mission is to build a Series of YouTube Cartoons and companion game apps that
Hold children's interest with fresh, exciting content,
Provides real value and
Helps them succeed.
To bring ZoomerangKidz Adventure series to market we need your help. By funding our project, you will contribute to getting the Episode (a YouTube cartoon and companion game set in Colorado). We expect this first episode to be highly successful and to generate revenue in a wider market, to enable production of subsequent ZoomerangKidz Series.
The 5 to 9 year old market is an underserved market. 66% of the apps for mobile devices are built for the 5 and younger age group.  There is a gap for innovative apps for children 5 to 9.
Children this age are naturally curious about finding and understanding the connection between what they are exposed to via media and how that relates to their ""real life"".  One way to keep that (curiosity) spark alive is to involve them in ongoing playful exploration that broadens their awareness and mirrors the life styles around them.
Creator ... Laura Weston Leighton.  Laura created and evolved the ZoomerangKidz project.  It has been a labor of love.  She has networked, collaborated and motivated many people to contribute to this project.  She has put this winning team together and will continue to provide the glue and motivation to ensure the project's success.
Technical Consultant … Dr. Chris Leighton.  Dr. Leighton has over 30 years experience planning, managing and contributing to systems and software development.  He will ensure our development plans are sound, well integrated & well executed.
Creative Director, Lead Animator and Head Writer … Rich Moyer.  Rich and his team did the introductory animation for this KickStarter campaign will continue to lead production of the YouTube Cartoons.  Rich will also ensure the Mobile App Games are well aligned with the YouTube Cartoons.Rich started his career as a syndicated cartoonist with Tribune Media Services in Chicago. Rich now combines his cartooning skills with gag writing and animation.  Rich has had development contracts with all of the major studios.
Voice Over Talent … Rich brings the additional talents of Maggie Roswell and Hal Rayle, to our adventure series.
Maggie Roswell is an Emmy nominated Voice Over talent recognized for her Voice Over work on Fox's The Simpsons.
Hal Rayle is also an Emmy nominated Voice Over talent recognized for his Voice Over work on Disney's - Rotten Ralph, Transformers & GI Joe.
Rich, Maggie and Hal have a long track record of producing hilarious, engaging cartoons in a variety of styles.
Developer … We have worked hard to find the most experienced team possible who ""get"" kids and who enjoy programming around our content. The Denver/Boulder corridor is bustling with game development talent, and we are happy to have found a local game developer team that has consistently delivered on-time & on-budget games for brand name companies.
Since the real world provides our context and content, we don't have to look very far for compelling and interesting details to fill our stories. Our first episode is set in Colorado; urban and rural with mountains and prairies, and a broad range of plants and animals, a compelling, colorful beginning to world exploration. Future episodes traverse the globe.

We have a heart to show the world what God is doing in and through Fearless LA, and the way we want to do this is by creating a documentary that captures the heart of this movement. Every movement has a sound that resembles it, and that sound is Fearless BND, the worship team of Fearless La. This documentary will take you along the journey of Fearless La, and the sound of worship that encompasses it.  
Donating to this project will make it possible for us to create, produce, distribute, and market this documentary to TV networks and Netflix. By donating toward this documentary, you are helping us reach the world with the message of Jesus and the story of Fearless. 
We are believing that people would come to know Jesus through this documentary. We are also believing for Christians to be inspired and ignited to share their faith, grow their local church, and be deeply rooted in their church community. We also believe that pastors and leaders will be greatly encouraged through this documentary, and that many will gain the courage they need to follow the voice of God in their lives after watching.
Thank you so much for giving, praying, and supporting this vision to reach as many as possible with this documentary, and ultimately, with the message of Jesus' love. We couldn't accomplish this goal without your partnership.

Care and Feeding of a Rocket Mass Heater
  Switching from electric heat to a rocket mass heater reduces your carbon footprint as much as parking seven cars. This is a DIY wood burning contraption that heats your home with one-tenth the wood a conventional wood stove uses, and puts out about one one-hundredth the smoke. A 30-minute video showing five different people using a rocket mass heater and talking about their favorite way to light and care for rocket mass heaters. This was our ""thanks"" for our ""Better Wood Heat: DIY Rocket Mass Heaters"" 4-DVD set kickstarter. kickstarter / dvds / microdoc.
PDF version of the permaculture playing cards
Ebook of Permaculture Playing Cards
  Another kickstarter that did really well; and we had many requests that the cards be turned into a book. Each card covers a powerful aspect of permaculture. Some feature people, some feature a philosophy and some feature a technique. I'm told that it takes an hour and a half to read the ebook. kickstarter / cards / ebook.
Natural Beekeeping Presentation
Natural Beekeeping with Jacqueline Freeman
   Jacqueline Freeman is author of ""The Song of Increase"", a book about a very different style of relationship with honeybees. In this presentation she covers some of the practical aspects of raising bees. I've called her techniques ""Reverence for Bees"". The presentation covers ""Treatment-Free Beekeeping"".
Rocket Cooker/Canner/Forge Plans
Rocket Forge plans
  If you look at DVD 4 from the ""Wood Burning Stoves 2.0"" kickstarter, you will see where we had a contest between a J-Tube style-rocket cook stove and a propane turkey cooker. Naturally, the rocket cook stove won. Lots of heat for your big cooking and canning needs. And then we stumbled onto using the same contraption as something of a forge. Actually, a pretty good forge that doesn't need bellows. Erica Wisner has put that design into plans for you. And, as you can see above, Erica will also be one of our PDC instructors. kickstarter / dvds / plans.
Public Thanks
I've seen some other kickstarters do this and I wanna do it much, much better. They post your name to a facebook page where it is lost and forgotten within a couple days. We are going to post it to our thread at permies.com where we have perennial discussions. Thousands of people will actually look at the list for years to come. And, naturally, we will give you a chance to be as creative and as silly as you want. While some people will post their names, or their kids, or maybe plug their business, you can also divulge your plans for world domination and give yourself all the galactic titles you want.  Check out the thanks page from our last kickstarter.
$5 CANDY!
Keeping in mind that the real purpose here is to bring in some coin so we can get the equipment to do live streaming, we felt we needed to entice people to put in $5 rather than leave their contribution at $1. Of course, everything at the $1 level is offered to our supporters at $5 or more.
Online Course ""Are Bees For Me?""
Are Bees For Me course
  Not just a video. The full, interactive online course with ""The Bee Whisperer"", Michael Jordan. You are one of the students. No foolin'! You get to ask questions and everything. Course.
Ebook ""The Six Ways to Raise Chickens""
Raising Chickens
  I wrote a book! It was a collaboration with Marjory Wildcraft of The Grow Network. It's 38 pages long. It is a mish-mash of my article Raising Chickens 2.0 - No More Coop and Run, my presentation ""Concerns About the Way Most People Raise Chickens"", and my permaculture design course presentation, ""Animals in the Landscape."" When we wrote it, I intended to sell it and to offer it on my next kickstarter. THIS kickstarter! I forgot to try to sell it. I should start selling it. Soon. That would be smart.
Streaming version of the Fire Science DVD
Fire Science
  This is from my ""Wood Burning Stoves 2.0"" kickstarter. Much like this kickstarter, people asked me to video a two-day workshop and sell them the video. For that project, it was just a giant doofus in overalls (me) holding a fancy video camera. But the kickstarter did far better than expected, so a professional editor turned the Friday night 3.5 hour ""Fire Science"" presentation into something much better which is now 1 hour and 37 minutes long. This is DVD 1 of 4. kickstarter / dvds
Greenhouse rocket mass heater plans
Greenhouse rocket mass heater
  This is actually five different plans mashed into 40 pages of detailed plans. The trick with rocket mass heaters and greenhouses is that the rocket mass heater will need to be water tolerant, so nearly all of our indoor designs won't work. plans
PDC and ATC instructor's notes
Every time Tim Barker teaches a course his notes get overhauled, his presentations get clearer, and more content can be squeezed in. Now his teacher's notes for the Appropriate Technology Course are at 51 pages and his Permaculture Design Course notes are at 208 pages. These notes will be provided as PDF files.

Comics creators Claire Connelly and Erica Schultz are known in both indie and mainstream comics circles as the second coming of Kirby and Lee. Maybe not, but at least in their own heads. They've partnered MANY times to bring the world such delightful stories as The Unauthorized Biography of Winston Churchill: A Documentary and Cheese: A Love Story, as well as ""Bishop Takes Rook; Knight Takes Pawn"" in the anthology This Nightmare Kills Fascists and Space Man (available here).
Well, they're collaborating again for STRANGE TAILS, starring the sci-fi space opera Eve: The Immortal Lobster!
 Eve is an oversized tale of alien lobsters fighting for freedom! YES! Lobsters and Freedom!

A job board that connects the job seeker to work that fulfills them.
BRiSK Works is an innovative new approach to finding a job AND finding the right applicant for your job. Traditional job boards bring back unimpressive results and confusing user experience on both sides of the job search. Companies are often hit with high and hidden fees, only to be let down with the resulting candidates. Candidates are overwhelmed and have a hard time finding the RIGHT job for them. It’s hard for everyone.
We’ve changed that.
In a nutshell – the mission of BRiSK is to better connect the job seeker to work that fulfills them. A job board and resume database that is FREE for companies to list their open positions, as well as provide other business services that they need from a central portal/profile.

BRiSK was originally founded to provide a platform that would promote and support the lean and efficient operations of our affiliate company, Dental Temps Staffing Solutions (DTSS), LLC.  After developing BRiSK Ops 1.0, BRiSK turned to some of the nation’s leading job board/resume databases to supply us with candidates. In short, after receiving unimpressive results and a poor user experience, we realized a change was drastically needed, so we developed our own solution.

503,2108693607,"Our mission is to stimulate economics in central West Virginia by providing a place for musical artists to record their works and to better the community by reaching out to youth to find a productive way to express themselves.  he idea for Screen Door Recording Studios was originated in September 2015 and has since grown to have a physical location in downtown Buckhannon, West Virginia and the equipment required to create professional quality music. The founder of this organization is Shane Workman. His role as of now is to facilitate funding to get the business off the ground and to facilitate a clientele base in his local area. He boasts years of experience in playing instruments and recording and producing music.  Though we have no investors as of yet, we are adamantly seeking financial assistance to help get us on our feet so as to be able to more efficiently run this business.  Being the first recording studio of its kind in Buckhannon, West Virginia, it is hard to tell how much Screen Door Recordings will grow over the course of time. However, the town of Buckhannon hosts an array of musical acts without the means to piece together a professionally recorded product. This will give us a steady clientele basis with no competition established, so we expect to grow at an accelerated rate once satisfied clients spread the word and share their product with those around them.  Screen Door Recording Studios is our trade name and we are a Limited Liability Corporation. Our full LLC name is Screen Door Studio & Services LLC. Primarily we are a recording studio located in downtown Buckhannon, WV and our customer base will consist of musical artists and bands in Buckhannon and other parts of central West Virginia. While this is our target demographic we will keep an open mind to expansion of our clientele base and will treat customers from other regions to the same quality products and services. Currently there is no recording studio in the downtown Buckhannon area that offers high quality audio recording and mastering. This serves as a competitive advantage and helps us to aid customer needs that are not being currently met in the area. Another advantage is the years of experience the co- founders have with playing and producing music. Being a unique business in the area, we will be able to easily tap into our target demographic and establish a customer loyalty base with ease. We aim to tap into this currently unused resource to generate revenue and expand business. We aim to get our start helping grass roots artists record their works and utilizing social media as well as more traditional outlets such as word of mouth and distribution of the artists’ music to not only promote the performers but to expand our name as well. We believe that we can gain the vast majority of the market share with ease in that no other professional recording studio exists in the city limits of Buckhannon. Though this town is small in size, artistry resonates throughout it at a high frequency and we believe that having access to a conveniently located studio will stimulate more artistry in the community. Even more into this approach, offering lessons in music theory will help these prospective new artists hone their skills to create quality pieces of musical expression. Our market penetration strategy begins by recording and mastering tracks for a select handful of artists of different genres and promoting the finished products through social media. This should prove effective as it demonstrates the array of music we will be able to produce and social media is a cost- effective and efficient form of advertising. We will primarily utilize Facebook, but are willing to adapt to other forms of social media in the near future as well."

510,524874094,"The Start
Being a bit cooped up recently, I started watching a particular animated show about the Pines family up in a strange, Oregon town, and I instantly fell in love and couldn't stop thinking about it.
At the same time, I've become more and more interested in oracle decks and tokens as ""mini guides"" for the day, and given the mysterious and fantastical nature of the show, I figured, ""Why not combine the two?""
So, here you have it, a homemade, 24-card Oracle ""deck of coins"" that will come in a pocket-sized carrying case!
What to expect...
Given Kickstarter's challenge to make something at home, that's just what I'm doing. This set of 24 ""coin"" cards will be fully designed by me, printed on my Canon Pixma Pro-100 on French Paper Co. 140 lb. Cardstock, hand-punched out, and contained in a two-piece metal tin with a label on the lid.
Outside fo the tin, everything will be homemade! (That being said, I may solicit backers for requests for the final few cards!)
24 Cards in Total! Each measures 2.25 inches
These will be considered ""Talismans"" for your day. At the start of your day, or when you need some extra courage for a situation, you'll simply draw one off the pile and receive some guidance! The items are inspired by the show, many of which you will recognize and be able to interpret with your own associations with the item! But, of course, the suggested interpretations are based on the show's use. (My ultimate goal is to expand these out. If these are successful, there will be new sets with the same backings to build this into an even bigger oracle collection!)
They will be super compact and pocket-sized, as they are 2.25"", printed front and back. Even in their black-tin case, they're travel size for any length of trip! 
Final Case May Be Slightly Different Based on Needs
As an additional bonus, while I've designed these using Blue as a spot color, you can Pledge to Pick Your Color and have a deck UNIQUE TO YOU! 
A few samples of what you can do to make a unique deck for yourself!
The Funds...
My goal is to simply get the cost of materials to make 50 of these decks, and cover some of the Kickstarter and shipping fees, which is why this has such a low funding goal.
Stretch Goals!
As this has such a low funding goal, I hope to add some cool bonuses for Kickstarter Folks!
$150 - A FREE, Vinyl Sticker for Pledges $8 and up! This will be created just for the Project!
$350 - I'll create and include a mini-guide to the deck that will fit into the case! It will contain additional information for interpreting your deck. This will come with EVERY DECK!
$500 - An Enamel Pin inspired by the deck and show! I'll design an enamel pin that will be included with Pledges $8 and up! This will be manufactured elsewhere.
Possible Setbacks
Since most everything will be handmade, there shouldn't be any problems or issues involved! That being said, if this does blow up beyond what I'm planning for here, it may take me longer to make and fulfill all of the orders, as this is a one-man operation.
The other possible delays are beyond my control, as shipping these days may cause some delays. Even more, if the Stretch Goals are hit, there could be a delay in the manufacturing and shipping of the stickers or pins.
If this happens, though, you'll hear it from me as soon as possible!
In general, though, this will be my Fifth Kickstarter, the previous four all being successful, and I have kept on track, on time, and provided what I proposed--and more in some cases!"
511,338975867,"Hello there!
I’m Isa and I always loved anime and kawaii stuff.
I hope this will be my second successful project! 
 I will be so grateful and happy if you could help me with this! I hope to have everyone's support to help me bring my set of Hard Enamel Pins to existence! If you are not able to participate financially, it is always appreciated that you share the project with people who may like it and be interested in it! 😁
Follow me on my social media for spoilers and wips about the project! Instagram & Facebook
Is a Hard Enamel Pin of one of the cutest Pokemon... ALOLAN VULPIX. This design was one of the goals of the previous project but could not be unlocked and as many people liked it and asked me, I have decided to make a new project exclusively for this design! 🤗
 If we achieve the goal, maybe I'll add some other designs to unlock (if you want to haha). 
You will get a matching GIFT sticker with your reward! The size for the stickers will be 5-6 cm. Each pin comes with a backing card too.
The project is all or nothing. This means you will not be charged until the campaign ends successfully. In the duration of the campaign, it is risk free. You won't get charged if we don't reach our goal either. You can also adjust your pledge tier at anytime before the Kickstarter ends. So you can pledge now and pay later.
 THE DESIGN
 ⭐ The colors of the vulpix will have glitter
TIMELINE
Late March: kickstarter starts
Mid April: kickstarter ends
Late April: Production begins if the project was succesfull
Late May: I get the pins and the shipping process begins

To keep the shipping prices low, it doesn't include tracking number. If you want a tracking number, please add 4€ to your pledge."
512,860874071,"As technology and methods of media consumption progress, sports journalism has lost quality. The industry has been taken over by yelling ridiculous statements and claiming it as a “hot take.” Great writers have been booted off of the internet to clear bandwidth for video-only sites. It seems that websites only create Clickbait to draw users. Once the site is opened, all the user finds is a page plastered with advertisements and poor content. 
That is not our goal. It is deplorable that sites bring in millions of dollars by exaggerating headlines that drive people to click on a link with no story. We want to bring an end to Clickbait and make sure that anything we post is relevant and worthy of its own page on the internet. It is important that media outlets provide content in all forms to best fit the needs of individuals while also keeping the quality that was found in “old fashioned” journalism. Sideline Intel does exactly that. It provides good content across multiple platforms. With time, Sideline Intel can become a driving force and perhaps an example in the journalism world. 
The money gained from crowdfunding will be used to finish building our website to perfect specifications and legal fees for making Sideline Intel an LLC, as well as marketing purposes to begin pushing our brand."

""The real winner in the Tchaikovsky competition"" 
as the London Spectator called Debargue (July 2015)
  Lucas Debargue, a young French pianist, won 4th prize of the XV International Tchaïkovski Competition as well as the Moscow Music Critics Association Prize. And this is just the beginning!
The Documentary is seen through the eyes of his friend, Martin Mirabel, to explore Lucas' passion and shed light on his unique relationship between musicians and music. 
There have been many documentaries on musicians, usually when they are at the peak of their careers. The originality of the project is to follow Lucas Debargue, who is at the beginning of his career…
Juin 2015, Lucas Debargue remporte le 4ème prix au concours Tchaïkovski et le prix spécial de la Critique. Une nouvelle vie commence.
A travers les yeux de son ami et réalisateur du documentaire, Martin Mirabel, le film explore la passion de Lucas et met en lumière les relations entre la musique et les musiciens. 
Il y a déjà eu beaucoup de documentaires sur les musiciens, le plus souvent lorsque ces derniers sont au sommet de leurs carrières. L’originalité du projet consiste à suivre Lucas Debargue, qui est lui, au début de la sienne...
Молодой французский пианист Люка Дебарг завоевал на конкурсе имени Чайковского в Москве четвёртую премию и приз ассоциации музыкальных критиков Москвы. Началась новая жизнь.
Глазами его друга и режиссёра Мартена Мирабеля, этот документальный фильм раскроет страсть к музыке молодого артиста, а также осветит уникальную взаимосвязь музыкантов и музыки.
Много документальных фильмов делается о музыкантах на пике их карьеры. Оригинальность нашего проекта в том, что мы хотим проследить за Люка Дебаргом в начале его карьеры...
    Lucas Debargue is the perfect incarnation of his music. He reads it, talks about it, plays it and listens to it. The film delves into the details of the life of this young pianist and follows him in his discoveries and quest through music and all its galaxies.
The film is structured around three main axes, which correspond to the  axes that define and characterize all musicians: interpretation, composition and improvisation.  
These match with a country, an atmosphere and a temperament.
Le pianiste Lucas Debargue respire la musique sous toutes ses formes. Il la lit, en parle, en joue et en écoute. Le film entre dans l'intimité de ce jeune pianiste épris d'absolu et le suit dans ses découvertes et sa quête à travers la musique et toutes ses galaxies.
Le film est structuré autour de trois axes principaux correspondant aux trois axes qui définissent et caractérisent tout musicien : l’interprétation, la composition et l’improvisation.
A chaque axe correspond un pays, une atmosphère et une temporalité.
 Люка Дебарг является идеальным воплощением музыки: он это читает, говорит о ней, исполняет и слушает. Этот фильм углубляется в подробности жизни молодого пианиста и следует по пятам во всех его открытиях, в поисках в музыке и связанных с ней галактиках.
Структурально фильм делится на три основные сферы, которые определяют и характеризуют всех музыкантов в принципе: интерпретация, композиция и импровизация.
Страна, атмосфера и время происходящего – это то, что определяет каждую из этих сфер.
      Lucas and Martin met at university in 2007. At that time, Lucas had stopped playing piano. Martin himself had set aside his film projects to devote himself to literature. With time and support of Martin, Lucas got back to the music...
Lucas et Martin se sont rencontrés à l'université en 2007. A cette époque, Lucas avait arrêté le piano. Martin, lui, avait mis de côté le cinéma pour se consacrer à la littérature. Avec le temps et le soutien de Martin, Lucas s'est remis à la musique... 
Люка и Мартен познакомились в 2007 году в университете. В то время Люка прекратил играть на фортепиано, а Мартен отложил занятие фильмом, чтобы посвятить себя литературе. Со временем и с поддержкой Мартена Люка вернулся к музыке...
     ""People are loving Lucas Debargue because he is a real musician. He loves music passionately and knows everything about it. And not only music. He has a brilliant knowledge of literature and art. The reach of his personality is unbelievable. He is kind of a genius, just a genius. If someone's playing with such a conviction and love, it will be transmitted. It’s 100% hypnotic: a hypnotic personality. The audience has no chance to resist such a personality and he has got a very strong one."" —Pianist Boris Berezovsky to Russian Radio Program 'Orfei', July, 2015 
« There has never been a foreign pianist who caused such a stir since Glenn Gould's arrival in Moscow and Van Cliburn's victory at the Tchaikovsky Competition. » Olivier Bellamy, Huffington Post France, July 2015 
« First, the piece form Medtner is unbelievable! Additionally I doubt that anyone has ever heard Ravel’s Gaspard performed like this. The French pianist Lucas Debargue must be a another world. Simply the most miraculous playing. » Seymour Bernstein, pianist
  « Les gens aiment Lucas Debargue parce que c’est un vrai musicien. Il aime la musique passionnément et sait tout d’elle. Mais pas que de la musique. Il a une connaissance brillante en littérature et en art. La portée de sa personnalité est incroyable. C’est une sorte de génie, juste un génie. Si quelqu’un joue avec autant de conviction et d’amour, la musique sera transmise. Avec lui, c’est de l’hypnose à cent pour cent, l’hypnose d’une personnalité. Le public n’a aucune chance contre une telle personnalité et pourtant, il en a lui-même une très forte. » Boris Berezovsky, pianiste, dans l’émission « Orfei » sur la radio Russe. Juillet, 2015.
« Il n’y a jamais eu un pianiste étranger qui a causé une telle agitation depuis l’arrivée de Glenn Gould à Moscou et la victoire de Van Cliburn au concours Tchaïkovski. » Olivier Bellamy, journaliste et animateur radiophonique, Huffington Post France, Juillet 2015
« D’abord, l’interprétation de Medtner est inoubliable ! Mais je doute que n’importe qui ait déjà entendu Gaspard de Ravel joué ainsi. Le pianiste français doit être d’un autre monde. Simplement le jeu le plus miraculeux. » Seymour Bernstein, pianiste
    It is only together that we can make this film and bring it to a great success all over the world!
To make this film a reality we are using crowdfunding and Kickstarter. We can’t do this project alone. We have budgeted this movie out as tightly as we can, but we still need support to finish.
This Kickstarter campaign will help us go faster. The shooting has already begun and we want to continue. This first year after the XV Tchaikovski Competition will be unique in Lucas Debargue’s life and we must capture these images fresh as they happen.
And as you know, Kickstarter does have some pretty awesome advantages. We can interact directly with you, our backers. That’s fantastic! We want to hear from each and every one of you! Talk to us and we promise to talk back. 
C’est ensemble que nous ferons de ce film un beau succès !
Nous utilisons Kickstarter parce que nous avons besoin de financement pour faire de ce film une réalité. Nous ne pouvons pas réaliser ce projet seuls. Nous avons optimisé le plus possible le budget du film, mais nous avons quand même besoin de soutien (et de financement) pour aller jusqu’au bout.
Nous utilisons aussi Kickstarter pour aller vite. Le tournage a déjà commencé. Nous voulons des images « fraîches ». Cette première année après le XVème concours Tchaikovski restera unique dans la vie de Lucas Debargue.

""Brave songs for a new day, "" were the words of Victor Jara, the Chilean singer song writer who is the inspiration behind the album title:   ""Brave Songs"".   These are the songs and stories of young people and adults who work for a more just world. Through music, Brave Songs wants to share the concept of bravery in a new light: those who work for peace and justice are our heroes. Folks of all ages can be agents of change.

The Brave Songs CD album is done!  It was a thrill and an honor to have musicians of the caliber of David Bragman, sound engineer, banjo master; L.J. Slavin on flute, mandolin and violin; Dennis Huston and Sol Dolnick.  Many others were involved with ths project, translating text to Arabic, Kiswahili, Hindi and Urdu:  teachers Hebba Abassi of Chicago and  Margaret Muthiga of Kenya, and Hayat Ahmad, a Canadian engineer who gifted me with a beautiful ghazal poem in Urdu, when I had simply asked for an Urdu  translation.  Eavon Ngo-Solis and her students wrote poignant narratives of their experiences as refugees and undocumented youth.  Joan Castro and I had the delight of creating a Rap poem with our Modern World History students at Sullivan High School.  Songwriters Jim Page, Anna Stange and Theresa Kubasak generously  let me share their songs.  The CD album is a 6-panel color digipak which has a synopsis of each song, and gives the grade level.  The art concept I had was beautifully executed by Arely Ramirez, a Little Village Chicago artist and former student of mine from Social Justice High School.  Graphic designer Renee Witherwax took Arely's scratchboard design and brought it to life!   This incredible artwork is also on the thank you cards and 11""x17"" poster.
My intent is to advocate for the use of song, as a means for sharing the stories of how people young and old work and sacrifice for social change and a more just world.  I want educators to use music, and see the literacy benefits in building fluency and thus empowering the voices and experiences of young people."
515,182036059," The best magicians of the 21st century set out on a journey to search  for the lost author of the most legendary book about the art of  sleight of hand. 
S.W. Erdnase… the pseudonym of the man thought to be the most notorious card shark of the 19th century. His book “The Expert at the Card Table” is now considered the card conjurer’s bible, making it compulsory reading for any magician.
It took more than 30 years after its publication for the true value of the book to be appreciated – too late for the author to witness the success of his work and too late for all the magicians who would have enjoyed meeting him. His true identity is still uncertain and remains a great mystery, leaving even the best illusionists in the dark.
The greatest magicians of our time go in search of the long-lost genius. They talk about the rumors of his supposed suicide and other stories that will chill you to the bone. No proof of the many legends appears to exist, but in searching for him we learn the true significance of this book. Along the way, we are given valuable insights into the history of deception through the ages and the origin of some of the best-kept secrets of the contemporary world of magic.
The film is geared to magicians already familiar with the story of Erdnase as well as people generally fascinated by the art of the illusionist. It provides a glimpse behind the scenes of the contemporary and historic magic scene and explores the depth of human curiosity. The prevailing question of the film is whether it is better to be left in the dark and fascinated or enlightened and disenchanted. The phenomenon of how legends are made is also a central element of the documentary. Erdnase is an excellent example of the importance that can come to be attributed to a story or a person despite the fact that very little information is available about them. The aim is for the audience to critically examine what they think they know about their own role models. 
Production of such a film is hugely expensive. Although we already have some funding from the German Film Fund and a team putting an incredible amount of energy into the project, the costs of flights and other travel, technical effects, catering, equipment, costumes, props etc. are all adding up — which is where you come in. You have an opportunity here to support the project. By chipping in, you can help us make this film a reality. 
 We are a young German film production company with a focus on feature films and documentaries. Our director Hans-Joachim Brucherseifer has been a card magician since he was 15. He learnt the art of sleight of hand from “The Expert at the Card Table”. In this docudrama he teams up with the most influential magicians of our time in search of the elusive author of the book.

516,605706136,"As a medium that is described as ‘accessible’ and ‘easy-to-use’ the photographic - with its forever-changing digital technologies - is something that is still not in everybody’s reach. This artists project will develop an understanding of the photo booth and propose an alternative way to accessing, using and developing photography as an expanding medium.  This project is leading towards a public exhibition of emerging photography graduates in London (Free Range 2013), and will fund the production and display of new work.  Supporters of the project will receive versions of the work and publications as a thank-you.
As a fixed device the photobooth offers a limit for both camera and subject, and turns the subject into an object. Social and theoretical arguments surrounding vernacular ideas of photography often centre on the photobooth as a space where both formal documentation and leisure activities take place side by side, though few artists use the medium in-depth: the photobooth provides a historical recording of our existence, our passing through official processes (identification photographs) and leisure time (mementoes, records of play, and of romance): there is enough to be said about the current day functions of the photobooth and the reasons for its part within this project. 
The work will be initiated through a series of tests to understand not only the physical space of the photobooth, but its performance and functioning as a camera. The tests will explore the technical aspects of the camera including depth of field, auto focus and facial recognition. Whilst acknowledging the booth as a fixed studio, tests will be carried out to record the cameras reaction to a change in environment. In other words, the tests will challenge the camera to perform outside of its ordinary default settings.  These test will explore a range of photobooths from digital to analogue to home made. 
There have been around 20 tests made for this project so far using a Photo-Me booth. these tests are allowing me to understand how the photobooth can be used to make day-to-day imagery, and from this I will make a ""how to"" user manual for the photobooth reminiscent of the how to photography guides seen in bookshops today.  An additional project questions the ID photo by challenging its rules and regulations - the first set of these are shown in the project updates section.
The project will be part of my graduate show in London 2013 at the Free Range fair. The Free-Range show is held in the Truman building on Brick Lane, London. Free Range provides a brilliant platform for graduates to showcase their creative talents to a diverse audience in the epicentre of London's creative scene. This event attracts upwards of 20,000 visitors and is an excellent opportunity to show my work to an audience.  All backers will receive a personal invitation to this exhibition by post.
Fundraising: What I am seeking
I am aiming to raise £400.00 to help the production costs of this work which includes testing the photobooth, printing and production, for prints and publication, and presentation tests and final display costs such as framing and mounting; Any contribution will help sustain the production of my project and help produce final pieces for the show next year as well as a book. The work will in turn help sustain my practice as an artist.
About my work
I have provided links to my previous work '26 Photographers': this is another project that deals with social elements of photography, and its users within the framing of Amateur or Vernacular photography.  It questions the ownership of the photograph by delegating the role of the photographer out to various subjects - please feel free to take a look at this and other projects to get a feel for my interests and the work I make. 
Please get in touch if you have any further questions, I very much enjoy talking about my work and would be happy discuss this with you. Here are a few examples of the work produced so far....

Entrepreneur-friendly app
We want to develop a pragmatic way to get a standard market size report based in the following principles:
 User Friendly - Entrepreneurs don't have to struggle with excel and formulas. We created a self-service web app focusing on the user experience (UX) and User Interface (UI).
 Market reports - Reports uses official sources by country including Total Outputs, Imports, Exports and Employment data in order to get market value estimates and trends for more than 900 available product and services classifications.
 Efficient - An affordable, fast and reliable way to get basic insights required for a business plan.

Context
Open Data and Big Data have been growing during the last decade. Nowadays companies (from micro to big enterprises) may take advantage of public open data in order to make decisions and improve their business strategies.
In the other hand, dealing with databases and data processing may be a constraint for entrepreneurs who don't have the requiered technical background. That's where Market Size Q borns. We have the mission of support entrepreneurs with an easy-quick way to get their market value estimations without incurring in big expenses or traditional consulting services during the first phase of their projects.
We developed ""Market Size Q"" web in Python, which is an open source programming language broadly used by many big web companies like Reddit or Instagram.
So far we have uploaded and calculated Market Size values for more than 900 classifications in 3 North American Countries (Canada, Mexico and United States) , but we need to scale the project and develop a marketing plan if we want to reach the potential users among the world.

521,1961072239,"Art and writing have been some of the most important influences in my life. With these tools, I learned so much about myself, my identity, the world around me and how to structure my life. Something about art and writing can communicate deeper meanings, feelings, and ideas in a personal and relatable way. 
Much of how we structure our identity and ability to relate with this world has to do with the ideas and experiences we are exposed to. This development of self begins at a young age, and children are highly impacted by the ways others teach them about this world. Often, we don’t talk to our children about big things like developing identity, choosing education and breaking out of the boxes people are limited to, yet they have been some of the most important, influential things I have had to learn in my life. Why don’t we start talking to kids about this earlier? Well, sometimes its hard to find a place to start.
A photo of the artist, exploring the world of South America after taking control of their life.
For me, learning how to do this all started when I met my love, my life partner, Raven. At that point, without knowing there were other options, I had gone through public school and was desperately trying to discover how to be who I wanted to be, in a world where being myself seemed unwelcome. Raven introduced me to the wonders of self-directed learning and opened me up to the concept of having control of my own life, identity, education, and relationships. I have been working over the following years to continue learning, growing, and actively taking the driver’s seat in my life, something that high school simply never taught me to do.
Then, while studying gender studies at the University of Utah, I had the amazing opportunity to begin talking to kids about the same things I was learning. There was a notion of empowering children, giving them a space to speak about the big things they were thinking about, one of those being identity development. I was so ecstatic to see 8 and 9 year olds talking about and exploring things that I simply never had a chance to when I was younger! 
When it came time for our final assignment, we were told that we would write a children’s book about a turning point in our identity, a big moment that really changed things for us. Filled with inspiration and excited to put my years of art and writing experience to use, I leapt in immediately. I started to design full watercolor and pen pages, trying to capture the magic of the moment when Raven looked into my eyes and told me: “You can do anything you set your mind to.” I worked day after day, hurrying to meet the deadline. 
The Original Watercolor Pages
I still remember the magic of that first reading, watching the enraptured looks on the kid’s faces as they followed Ikiyo, my persona, and Raven through the story of breaking out of boxes and creating a magical life. After my final was finished, I set the book aside for a while, until later that year when I went to Not Back to School Camp. 
A camp that was designed for unschoolers, homeschoolers, and self-directed learners, 2017 was my last year of camp. However, camp was probably one of the biggest moments that changed my path besides meeting Raven and learning about a different way to engage life. As I watched all the younger campers, I had an idea. I pulled the watercolor pages from my car and decided to set up a reading during camp, while my partner Raven accompanied with music. Yet again, I remember enraptured faces and excited silence as I turned slowly through the pages, and when I was finished I was greeted by overwhelming enthusiasm. One of the dear staff members at camp approached me and communicated just how amazing the book was, how captured he was in the story and how it was the highlight of his entire camp experience. He told me that I should get the book published to be able to be an influence to others positively. 
A look at one of the pages, showing one of the main characters, Raven.
For a couple years now I’ve revisited the watercolor pages, making adjustments and trying to figure out how I would publish it, but unsure of what to do. 
Finally, with another push from that same staff member long ago, with encouragement from my partner Raven, I’m trying to embody the idea that I can do anything I put my mind to by finally finishing this project and offering it to the world. My story, my development, has saved me from dark, scared, small places where I had no idea who I was. If with that story I can touch even one child to break out of their boxes, to be themselves and to take control of their life, then I believe I will have changed the world. After all, children are our future, and empowering them to be unique, to take the driver’s seat in life, and to be themselves is part of giving them the chance to start this journey early and take the future into their own hands.

Help me share my story with others, see if we can touch just one little soul at a time, to make this world a better place for all of us."

 Hello everyone! My name is Abi Stevens. I'm a digital illustrator and chronic migraineur, so for my 1st Kickstarter I want to spread the love to my fellow Spoonies and Chronic Warriors!
I will be selling these pins online and at fairs, exhibitions and cons in the future, and will be donating 20% of future profits to the National Migraine Centre.
(The Kickstarter funds will go towards production costs, postage and fees, per Kickstarter rules)
 If you'd like to follow the progress of the Kickstarter, you can follow me on Twitter and Instagram too. You can also find out more about my illustrations and the impact chronic migraine has had on how I approach my work by watching my PechaKucha presentation.
Why Pledge?
As a small independent supplier I can't afford the risk of funding all these lovely things out of pocket, so without pledges many of these designs would never see the light of day! 
In exchange for supporting the production of these pins, pledging via Kickstarter provides you with a discount on purchase, because you're part of the process!
RRP for the pins once ordered will be £10, but as a Kickstarter backer you get a discount!
If you're lucky enough to snag an Earlybird pledge then each pin will be only £8, but if you miss out on Earlybird then each regular Kickstarter pin will be £9, which still saves you a nice 10%!
There are also further benefits to backing the Kickstarter as new goals are unlocked. For example; if we hit £1000 then all pin orders will come with a free sticker!
Everyone who orders a pin via pledge will be able to choose which pins they want as new designs are unlocked, as long as they edit their pledge before the Kickstarter ends.
What's on offer?
I have two key soft-enamel pin designs; migraine warrior, and chronic warrior. 
Each has a black & gold colour-way and a 4-colour-way. I'd really love to get all 4 versions funded so that people can choose their favourites (and I have some cool things planned for further stretch goals) but our first goal is to fund Pin no. 1!
Goal: £400
This design is for everyone! Chronic illness come in many shapes and forms, so I wanted to start with a design which is inclusive and represents the whole spoonie community. 
This soft-enamel pin comes in a smart gold colour with black enamel, for those who prefer a simple and stylish look!
  All the pin designs in this Kickstarter are 45mm tall, to make them extra eye-catching (and legible!) 
Stretch Goal 1: £450
All pins now come with backing cards, to make sure they look extra classy!
Stretch Goal 2: £800
My second stretch goal is to fund pin design no. 2: the Migraine Warrior design in classy gold with black enamel to match the Chronic Warrior pin! Fingers crossed everyone! 
 Here is a mock-up photo of how the first two pins will look in real life:
 Stretch Goal 3: £900
Each pledge now comes with a free 10cm holographic sticker! 
  Stretch Goal 4: £1300
We have now unlocked pin no. 3: the 4-colour version of the Chronic Warrior pin with black nickel.
 ...and here it is on the backing cards: 
Stretch Goal 5: £1700
I'm super excited to hit this stretch goal so that I can produce pin no. 4: the 4 colour version of my Migraine Warrior design, in black nickel!
This stretch goal also includes backing cards:   
Here's a mock-up of how pins no. 3 and no. 4 will look in real life: 
If we make it all the way through the stretch goals above, more will be announced! Watch this space!"
523,1086188217,"Imprisoned in Burma in 1990 as the communists began to take over, Modi Thiranai, with no medical experience, became the prison doctor to hundreds of dying men. Meanwhile, his wife fled to northern Thailand in search of refuge where Modi joined her 3 years later. Today Modi, a Lahu man who is 90% blind, runs a dormitory to support the education of children from the diverse ethnic hilltribes of Northern Thailand.
The story of Modi Thiranai encapsulates the adversity and struggle of thousands of hill tribe people. His journey from school teacher to opium seller, from prison doctor to dormitory director, frames the resilience of the human spirit and the struggles that have faced minority groups for centuries.
Modi’s story needs to be told to bring attention to the importance of being a conscientious global citizen. There are two predominant ways to travel: one is to enjoy the sights, photo opportunities, and “splashes” of culture; and the other revolves around connecting with locals, hearing their stories, and experiencing their culture and way of life as they become family and friends. 
We envision a world where people are recognized for their humanness, not for their differences. Modi’s story in our documentary will help others recognize that these stories exist and it is possible for anyone to find their own inspiring “Modi story” while traveling with a conscious mindset. The first step to unite us as humans is to recognize our society’s ethnocentric disposition towards “different” cultures and then present an opportunity for altering this mentality. We are here to expose the wander-prone generation to a new kind of adventure, one that is human-centric and sustainable, and creates a sense of community that is necessary for our ever-expanding and connecting world. Our invitation to travelers is to consider slowing down on their adventures and be curious about the people around them and the rich stories they have to share.
Our Kickstarter goal is $6500 and that is to cover the basics needed for production (we’ll be hunting down post-production funding later), including the three of us getting to Thailand and staying there over the summer. If we don't meet the $6500 goal, no money will change hands (aka costs nothing to you and our project isn't funded). 
We have two higher goals: 
Raise $11,500; this will get us some solid film, audio, and lighting equipment in addition to getting us to Thailand
Raise $14,000 and we can buy some dream equipment to bring with us! Drones and gimbals are the dream; we wake up at 4am with jaw-dropping aerial shots of Huai Nam Khun dancing in our head."

526,1649188706,"Ethan Cogwheel is the pseudonym of an Italian author. He worked for seven years on the Smart Project trilogy, of which ""Blackwood"" is the first book. Seven years to carefully study the young-adult readers, to understand which story would have been able to amaze them. And he found it.
The trilogy is one great story, subsequently divided into three books. Blackwood is the first to be published. While the book received positive feedback from both young readers and adults, the booktrailer - which is the video of the project - was shown at the Venice Cinema Festival and at the Anteo cinema in Milan, finalist in the Booktrailer Film Festival and Trailers Film Fest competitions.

Blackwood plot
""Ethan Cogwheel is Unit Ninety-nine of the Smart Campus, a complex of buildings aimed at preserving the last remaining human nucleus. There, boys and girls are empowered in mind and body so as to ensure the continuation of the species. The role that everyone will have in society is imposed at birth, by assigning a number that indicates the value. When Mike One, at the head of the entire organization, proclaims a competition with the chance to go out into the world as a prize, the protagonist participates to escape the system. The disappearance of a Master, an unusual blackout, conflicting rumors and a mysterious auburn-haired girl are phenomena that Ethan cannot ignore, but he will have to concentrate to be able to pass the five tests of the competition and thus cancel his number""

If the structure may seem strictly dystopian, reading, you suddenly realize the numerous levels that the author has built.
A boy who grows up and desires his recognized individuality. The topic of school competitiveness masked and then faced. A look at a future that is a critique of the present. Blackwood branches out on several themes and deals with them in its gray future.

529,300040240,"Hello, my name is Katie Skelly and I'm a cartoonist in Brooklyn, New York. My comics work includes MY PRETTY VAMPIRE, MAIDS, THE AGENCY, and NURSE NURSE. I am also the creator of BAD GIRL TAROT, a 78-card tarot deck I produced through a Kickstarter fundraiser in 2018.
Creating BAD GIRL TAROT was a wonderful experience and opportunity for me to learn the language of tarot and interpret its coda in my style, and I'm so pleased that two years later people are still discovering and enjoying the deck. As time went on I found myself still thinking about how I could further connect my art with divination, and what I would like to see both visually and structurally if I created a brand new deck from scratch. And so after further research and encouraging words from followers I've created a new project: BAD GIRL ORACLE.  
BAD GIRL ORACLE tuck-box cover
BAD GIRL ORACLE is a 40-card divination deck meant to connect readers to the spirit and energy of bad girl archetypes using the visual language of genre film and pulp fiction. The archetypes represented balance qualities human and supernatural, authoritative and subversive, young and mature, corrupt and innocent, among others. The cards can be read on their own or used to clarify or complement a tarot reading, as tools for manifestation or meditation, or for entertainment. 
The BAD GIRL ORACLE cards include: The Acid Queen, The Alien, The Avenger, The Career Girl, The Cat Burglar, The Coquette, The Courtesan, The Cyborg, The Dancer, The Delinquent, The Demon Mother, The Diva, The Domme, The Earth Mother, The Femme Fatale, The Final Girl, The Gamine, The Goth, The Headmistress, The Heretic, The Ingenue, The Maid, The Mastermind, The Moll, The Muse, The Mystic, The Outlaw, The Party Girl, The Possessed, The Psychic, The Queen Bee, The She-Wolf, The Siren, The Spinster, The Star, The Succubus, The Vampire, The Widow, and The Witch. 
I'll be posting card art in progress on my site here: https://www.katieskellycomics.com/bad-girl-oracle
The cards may be read both upright and reversed, and the deck will come with a folded instruction sheet to provide guidance for interpretation.
 The deck pieces consist of:
40 cards printed on durable, high quality card stock
A custom printed tuck box
A folded instruction sheet
I will be using the same vendor as BAD GIRL TAROT, and all pieces will be produced in the USA. For visual reference, at 4x6 inches the BAD GIRL ORACLE cards will be slightly larger than the BAD GIRL TAROT cards:  
Using this Kickstarter, I am aiming to raise enough to cover the cost of printing and shipping the decks. If we are to raise over the initial fundraising goal, I'll expand the print run and add more ORACLE related merch, including stickers and pins. I have over 60% of the final artwork completed, and I conservatively estimate that the decks will be ready to ship by August 2020. I am keeping the rewards simple in order to get the decks in your hands as soon as possible.
Thank you so much for your consideration, and hope you'll back the first printing of BAD GIRL ORACLE.
Design for the back of the cards
Update 6/20/20: to say thanks to everyone for pushing the project way beyond its goal, all pledges $35+ will receive a BAD GIRL ORACLE enamel pin. THANK YOU!"
530,1667654842,"Hey hi folks! I'm Alex Zandra, gamedev everything person, artist, writer, and light novel author—and I have a new book! I Signed Up To Be The Substitute Familiar Of A Struggling Witch To Pay My Bills And I'm Just Now Realizing What I Got Myself Into (or, Substitute Familiar) is my third light novel; it's about magic, witches, demons, and getting in over your head. It's also my biggest book yet!
Which brings me to this campaign: I need help to print it! It's too big to make a saddle stitch print, so it's going to be perfect bound like a paperback. However, that means the print run will be more expensive—and that's why I need your help!
Here's your chance to preorder the book, get some fun extras (like having it dedicated, get your name on the kickstarter backer appreciation page at the end of the book, commission custom sketches and stories, get turned into a demon) and help me make my third light novel a reality in print form!
If you'd like to read the digital version, it's available on itch.io (where you can find the first two chapters as a free demo) as well as Amazon! You can also find my earlier books Squid Maids (itch, amazon) and Cat Wishes (itch, amazon) there if you'd like! And if physical versions are more your style, you can order the print versions of my earlier works in this kickstarter too.
I printed a sleeve that I slipped over an existing book I had to give you an idea of what the finished product will be like; here it is next to my other books!
mockup of Substitute Familiar's print form
Thank you so much for your support! :D
UPDATE:
goals tbh
Oh my gosh we got funded!! :D I was planning to have to wait on these for a little bit more, but here are some stretch goals!
I had some savings put aside to help make sure I didn't need to ask too much from the campaign but you folks blew past that in record time! So here's what I had planned for beyond that: short stories! These would be in digital formats (PDF/ePub) and about the length of a single chapter. They'd give some additional backstory on existing characters, or a peek at things that happened off-camera in zandraverse books! I've wanted to do small stories like this for a while and this campaign should give me the resources and motivation to do it. ^^ Here's what I have in mind:
Tora's First Day: the origin story of Cat Wishes' intimidating tiger girl!
Penelope and the Council: this scene was alluded to in Substitute Familiar, but we never got to know what actually happened... until now!
Therapy Catgirl Tabbi: everyone's favorite striped catgirl from Cat Wishes finds herself a part-time occupation as a therapy cat!
(These are all text-only, but if we reach the illustration stretch goal, each story above and below will get exclusive art!)
A Drink To Amanda: time for Substitute Familiar's number one magical girl to shed some light on her origin story!
Of course, everyone who backs this kickstarter campaign at any level will get access to any and all stretch goal short stories as soon as they're made; but just in case, I've also added digital tiers for folks who want to support Substitute Familiar (and get just the bonus digital content) but who don't want or need physical things!
...and because everyone's been absolutely amazing, we reached the final stretch goals: cosplay photoshoots! I'll put together outfits for some of the characters of each respective book and take some pictures! :D (You can also bet I'll be in costume at future events where I table if I can help it.)
I'll also finally get around to taking that nap I really need. =_=
So that's all the stretch goals! Any money beyond this point will go towards making those short stories and cosplays even BETTER!
Thanks again so much for your support! I'm stoked that we made it this far and I can't wait to see how much further this campaign can go! <3"

LIVESTREAM AT 10:00AM AEST ON THE 17TH OF JANUARY: 10 FREE DIGITAL COMMISSIONS
Our purpose in this campaign is to immerse people in the aesthetics of Chinese traditions and bring a new style to your collection. All that we are offering is a limited edition commission to be able to engage with our backers and paint a unique calligraphy especially for them.
We are featuring the artwork of a professional Chinese calligrapher who has migrated from China to Australia. It is called ‘art’ because his style is either abstract or controlled, varying depending on the nature of the subject – uniquely elegant. Living in a multicultural country has allowed him to create calligraphy which retains the traditions of Chinese writing whilst border lining the graphic design paintings used in a modern Australian home.  
For collectors, for modern homes, for personal enjoyment, for showcase.
ZODIAC DOG (2018) Style which mimics the dog appearance
For us at Handtalk who dream to help others experience the beauty and elegance of artwork from different cultures, this has been an enjoyable project. Now, we want to transfer our joy to you, our backers.
  We have experience running Kickstarter campaigns and will be on time. Orders being processed and delivered in February is plenty of time for us to package and ship. The calligrapher will be with use round-the-clock to fulfill pledges but also pay special attention to every calligraphy so you are satisfied. "
532,2095547741,"Kickstarter says to keep it brief. Looks like we broke that rule, but we’re rebels here at the Owl Miine. When someone says we can’t do something, it makes us want to do it more. Like fix social media. 
I don’t have to tell you that the current social medias have big problems. Everyone’s talking about it, but nobody seems to be coming up with real solutions. It doesn’t have to be an all or nothing approach. I listened. I researched. I analyzed. I came up with a well rounded approach. 
You can tell me what you think by supporting this project, or not. The choice is yours. That is the theme of the Owl Miine. It’s all about the choices YOU make. How do you want YOUR social media to work for you?
OUR MISSION:
 Privacy. It’s not just about what you post, but also how you are being tracked. We don’t track you.
 Content. See what you want AND turn off what you don’t want.
 Connections. Better control of how you connect with people.
 Parenting. You decide how your kids use social media with monitoring tools. 
 Rewards. Help out and we help you.
 Publishers. Make money on your content by controlling advertisements or sponsors.
 Businesses. We don’t hide your content to your audience.
 Promotions. We guarantee your promotion meets goals. 
 Advertisers/Sponsors. Easily find and connect with publishers.
 E-commerce. Customers, marketing, and products in the same place.
Please allow us to take you on a guided tour through the Owl Miine. Hop in a mine cart, we are heading down the shaft.  One feature leads to the next so it’s best to read in order. 
Connections and Accounts
First, let’s talk about connecting people in the Owl Miine. This is one core feature that sets us apart from everyone else. We have to take a step back to understand an account to then understand how connections are made to them. Social Media is strictly about the connections. Without these connections it would be just another media site, and still I have yet to see others explaining how their connections work. 
Every account has sub-accounts. For example, you could have a friend, family, and work sub-account. Each account can have its own profile and if someone wants to connect, YOU decide which sub-account they are associated with. You can keep your work account professional, and share your child pictures only to your family account. By the way, you could connect people more than one way. Add a family member to your family AND friend account. 
When sharing, you decide where to share to. These sub-accounts allow way more control and ease than simply managing groups of people. If you are in the public eye, you don’t have to connect people to any account, you may simply set their request to “follow me” to allow them to view your public nuggets of information.  
(Ya, we went there…in the Owl Miine, “nuggets” are content, the members are mining nuggets of information, whether it be a post, picture, video or other content)
Parents Rejoice! Behold the Child Accounts
This leads us to the child sub-account! A much needed feature for parents. You may create one or more child accounts. Parents set access control based on age appropriateness among other factors. On top of that, we are implementing a soon to be patent pending QuickApprove process by which a parent can turn this feature on, and before allowing a child to view any content, a parent account can view this content first. Parents only have to mark items they don’t want their children to view. That’s not all! Let’s talk about our rating system. 

Rating System
All nuggets are rated for age appropriateness when created (if you don’t know what a nugget is, read above). By default, everything is rated Adult. To get anything rated below that (toddler, child, teen), it will go through our process of being approved by other adults. Why would anyone bother to help? Aha, this leads us to another core feature of the Owl Miine, the rewards!

Reward System for helping
Let me start with saying I don’t believe in getting something for nothing. We need your help. Social Media NEEDS your help. Instead of creating complex computer intensive AI systems to scan all data to figure out correctness (like if something is rated correctly), it is much easier and more efficient to allow members the opportunity. For example, a video might have a question “Is this suitable for a child” and when enough people agree, it will get that child rating. 
When you help us with different tasks, we will reward you with a virtual gem. These gems all have different names and meanings depending on what was done to receive them. They can be used towards advanced offerings we have, or even transferred to others. The rewards also add up on an official tally of total rewards earned. Even if you transfer them, it does not affect your total tally. 

What is a tally used for?
First off, the tally may be hidden or shown publicly. Since each gem has a meaning, it could be used to show other members how helpful one is at something. For example, since we are infusing e-commerce, a member might receive a type of gem to indicate they have successfully completed transactions. Seeing a high tally could put others at ease in doing transactions. Be careful, we also have the opposite of gems if something negative is done! Use it or not, it’s another tool for you.

Here is another big difference in the Owl Miine. When posting any nuggets of information, it must include at least one but no more than two most relevant categories to tell others what it is about. Is it humor or is it politics? Maybe it is both. Members helping make sure these are correct are another way to earn rewards via gems. It is with these categories that the true power of filtering comes in.
Filtering
We all know someone who is annoying with what they post. At the heart of our feed system is content filtering that gives you ultimate control. If you don’t like that one Uncle’s political views, turn off ALL politics from him only but keep his humor coming. Maybe you are sick and tired of politics in general – turn it off from EVERYONE! Take it out of your feed. Done. 
Maybe you are having a bad day and need some inspirational memes. Find only those in the Owl Miine to give yourself a pick-me-up.  Speaking of pick-me-ups, how does one pick-themselves-up some cash?

Promotions
With underwhelming results from advertising a business on other platforms, I thought to myself I’d rather have just given my money to my audience. And behold, a new form of advertising was born in the Owl Miine. 
When a local business wants to promote, they choose the target size to reach, put up money towards a view count and it goes into a special shaft (a shaft is a “channel of content”). There you can find promotions and share. The unique view count you helped generate is paid to YOU. The Owl Miine shares all promotions 50-50. When the promotion is done, it shuts off. Businesses reach their goals, you are happy, we are happy. 
What if you are looking for a larger, more targeted or nationwide audience to reach?

Sponsor a Publisher
Everyone is technically a publisher, but once one gains a certain level of followers you may join the publishers program and seek out advertisers or sponsors. At the same time, advertisers are seeking publishers whose content is in-line with their targeted audience. 

How Publishing Works 
We are providing the metrics on the publisher (for example, how many followers, type of content they share, etc.) so an advertiser can find and target an audience they want.  It works both ways - a publisher can also seek out a sponsor.  We leave the negotiating between publisher and advertiser and we split the revenue 50-50. That is how we make money and you make money. WE DON’T RUN ADS TO COMPETE. If an advertiser is seeking a large audience they must engage a publisher through our tools. 
Let’s be clear, to join the publishing program, it is subscription based dependent on the amount of followers you have. Everyone is free up to a certain amount. The more followers, the more it costs, HOWEVER the reason is two-fold. First, we don’t restrict what your followers see from you. That takes a huge toll on bandwidth. So if you didn’t want to run ads or get sponsors, we couldn’t make any money. Businesses could be publishers if they had a large following, and maybe a large business doesn’t want to bother with ads, they just want unfiltered access to their audience. Paying a monthly fee might make more sense to them.  
Publishers could also run just enough ads to cover the subscription fees. The choice is theirs.
If you didn’t read anything else, READ THIS SECTION AGAIN. This is at the heart of how we make money and you can make money while not having to collect any individuals data and habits to sell to advertisers. 
DO NOT LET OTHERS TELL YOU TO GIVE UP YOUR PRIVATE DATA IN ORDER TO PARTICIPATE!
Privacy
When people say, “But I don’t share much on social media, I have no concerns” that absolutely drives me up a wall. That tells me YOU are the ones who need to be woke. Social media is not just using what you post, they track where you go after you leave them, what you looked at on OTHER SITES, what background information they can pick up on your mic, where your eyes look on a page, GPS coordinates of your whereabouts, it goes on and on. It’s not just social media, it’s other services as well. You don’t have to believe me, look it up! Wake up!
This was the first problem that all other solutions must not invade. 
We can’t wake everyone up, but we can do our part to protect the Owl Miine users by being crystal clear about what data we use and how we use it. 
Our privacy starts with verification. You might not have to be verified to use Owl Miine, but what you can do will be limited. Members want to know if this is really John wanting to be friends, or is it John’s hacker wanting to be friends. To protect you and your family, we need a higher level of verification as to who is using our service. 
We are also dealing with currency transactions. That requires an even higher level of verification. Verification is NOT invasion of privacy. Hackers stealing data that shouldn’t have been collected in the first place IS an invasion. That is one thing we need to protect. 

E-commerce
If you don’t know what e-commerce is, skip ahead because we are not explaining that here. What we will say is we are infusing e-commerce right into the heart of our platform. Do you run a small e-commerce site now? Chances are you could set up shop in the Owl Miine where you have your customers and product all in one place. We have great things in store, but I’ve already told the competition too much. 

What else can I do in the Owl Miine?
The starting guidelines are simple, you can do anything legal unless it’s too heavily regulated. Even then we will be building the tools to comply with regulation if our members want it. 
We want free speech, not hate speech directed at any group. There is a difference. We defined it. 
Absolutely no harassment or bullying will be tolerated to or from a child account. 
Let’s be more responsible adults at the Owl Miine. 

Platform of Platforms
There is much we discussed, and much we haven’t mentioned. This isn’t one approach to one problem, but many approaches to many problems in our attempt to solve huge issues, most of which the average person isn’t aware of...yet. 
Let’s fix these issues before it’s too late. 
We are providing the platform and tools for YOU to control your privacy, your data, your content, your children, your business, your participation level, your rewards.

What the Owl Miine Needs From You
SUPPORT! We want to hear you are behind us and would like to see the Owl Miine get launched. See what rewards we can offer you for helping us!

Current Status
It’s been about a year and a half to get to this point. The research, the design, a scope of work is created. Most technologies have been chosen. The coding has begun but it’s a long way to go. There was a learning curve for new advances in technology. 
It is a very ambitious and complex project. Normal software techniques just can’t handle the complexity and scale adequately to the demands of a modern platform like this. The concentration of work is on the front facing user experience. We can utilize our resources to compete with the big players because we are not creating artificial intelligence on the backend and we are not tracking huge amounts of personal data.  

Meet the Team
Hi. I’m Brent Graham. I’m currently the team. I’ve been working with various technologies and software since the mid 1990’s. I’ve architected and coded many systems specializing in full stack web development. I’ve been the sole developer and I’ve managed small teams. Most recently I started a company to handle business consulting and software needs of clients. I can also make a video when I need to. 

Why Support Owl Miine and the Team
This isn’t my first rodeo. I’ve taken problems and utilized software for solutions. I’ve built related tools that can be utilized in the Owl Miine to speed development. 
I’m not taking your support and “giving” it to developers to figure out. Your support is covering just my expenses so I can work unobstructed for the next year. I could code for clients and make good money, but I’ve become obsessed with completing the Owl Miine (my family agrees). This is a huge task and ultimately would like to reach stretch goals to allow myself to put together a small development team that shares the passion. Will you offer support?
My daughter would like to help me out with her beautiful drawings, so I am setting up a limited amount of rewards for her to hand draw you a drawing of your choice of content. I cannot guarantee your content will be drawn. I ask for an owl, she draws a unicorn. Many unicorns. Please help.

Kickstarter is telling us to WRAP IT UP
We got a little lengthy. Sorry about that #notsorry, but there was so much to explain.
Everyone has different reasons for using Social Media. We hope by reading what the Owl Miine has to offer, we touched on some, if not all of your concerns. 
I have done my due diligence of researching and designing a system to handle all the established goals with a business and revenue model that I believe works for us all, not just a select few. If you also believe, I encourage you to help out any way you can. Even if you simply share on the current social medias to bring awareness, it would be very much appreciated.

I månadsskiftet mars/april sker den sista, avgörande röstningen i Europaparlamentet om Copyrightdirektivet och artikel 13. Därefter blir det lag i Sverige. Det innebär att länkar med bild och ingress kommer att kräva licens och att sajter behöver skaffa internetfilter. 
Men framför allt innebär det att sajter blir skyldiga att se till att brott tas bort - innan de hunnit bli ett brott. Läs mer om Copyrightdirektivet här.
Det är en ödesfråga för internet som är kraftigt underbevakad. Därför söker jag nu finansiering för att vara på plats och kunna göra journalistik om vad som händer - och allra helst kunna finansiera att publicera ännu mer, öppet och tillgängligt för alla.
Varför jag?
I snart ett år har jag bevakat EU:s copyrightdirektiv. Inte för att jag är bäst på det, inte för att mitt intresse är starkast, utan för att i princip ingen annan journalist har gjort det. Det började som en krönika i Göteborgsposten, fortsatte som krönikor i Breakit, TV4 och på sistone också i min egen blogg. Jag har försökt sätta mig in i EU:s strukturer, processen kring hur lagar och direktiv blir till. Jag har intervjuat experter, parlamentsledamöter, tjänstemän och ministrar för att försöka förstå hur direktivet har blivit till och var det är på väg. 
Det mest förbluffande under det knappa år jag bevakat frågan är att inse hur få andra journalister som ens försökt sätta sig in i frågan. Efter presskonferenser fullt av korrespondenter och journalister är det ingen som sökt upp ansvariga politiker för enskilda intervjuer. Det har gjort att jag fått intervjuer där ledamoten som lett frågan om copyrightdirektivet avslöjats inte veta vad han röstat på. En intervju som fick stor internationell spridning - eftersom ingen annan var där och frågade.
Därför söker jag nu stöd. För att fortsätta vara där och fråga. För att förstå varför det här direktivet röstas igenom, vilka drivkrafter som står bakom och berätta om dem.
Vad används pengarna till?
Resa och ersättning för arbete. En resa till Strasbourg (eller Bryssel - det är inte klart exakt när och var omröstningen kommer ske) med boende och omkostnader landar på ungefär 8 000 kronor. En dags heltidsarbete ersätts enligt Journalistförbundets frilansrekommendation, med 10 000 kronor inklusive skatt. 
Två dagar inklusive resa = 28 000 kr.
Skulle jag få in mer pengar kommer jag att sätta upp nya mål som innebär mer rapportering, att fler röster hörs. Det sistnämnda är viktigt, eftersom flera parlamentsledamöter - svenska som internationella - är övertygade om att de som är kritiska eller protesterat mot förslaget inte finns. Att de är botar, konstruerade av nätjättar. Det finns säkert skäl till oron, men allra mest är det en illustration om varför kvalificerad journalistik i den här frågan behövs.
== Stretchgoal 40 000 kr ==
Ytterligare en dag i parlamentet (totalt tre), med rapporter och intervjuer.
== Stretchgoal 60 000 kr ==
Reportageresa för att träffa några av ""botar"" som engagerat sig i frågan. Ett försök att kartlägga vilka det är som står bakom organisationerna som samlat in fyra miljoner namnunderskrifter. Vilka är de, var finns de - och vilken substans finns bakom att dessa röster och underskrifter inte skulle existera på riktigt?
== Stretchgoal 90 000 kr ==
Skicka TVÅ journalister till parlamentet! Nu en videojournalist! Får vi in denna summa anlitar jag en grym person som hjälper mig fota och göra video från hela besöket i parlamentet! Både längre och kortare saker som redigeras och publiceras i öppna kanaler! Det här kan vara avgörande för att nå nya målgrupper, som kommer att dra sig från att läsa en text. Kostnaden ska täcka personens arvode och resa till EU-parlamentet. 
== Stretchgoal 115 000 kr ==
Rapportering på engelska - nu når vi hela Europa!  Jag anlitar en översättare som översätter de publiceringar jag gör under resans gång (inte sociala medier-uppdateringar, men texter och alla ev undertexter till videos). Översättaren anlitas per dag (för att vara ständigt beredd) i tre heldagar och översätter hemifrån Sverige. Kostnad mellan 5 500 och 8 000 kr per dag inkl skatter.  
== Stretchgoal 115 000 - och över ==
Alla pengar går till att finansiera mer journalistik inför voteringen och under voteringen i parlamentet. Inför voteringen kan det handla om att kartlägga hur de svenska ledamöterna kommer att rösta, till att prata med lobbyistorganisationerna som arbetat hårt med direktivet. Men det kan också finansiera grafik som vi kan använda för vår rapportering - allt beroende på hur långt över 115 000 vi kommer.    
Var publiceras det?
Kontinuerligt i sociala medier och gratis på min egen hemsida, http://emanuelkarlsten.se. Primärt genom text, men också genom bild, ljud och video - utifrån behov. Eftersom målet med rapporteringen kommer vara att sprida information och kunskap till allmänheten förbehåller jag mig rätten att också publiceras på andra etablerade plattformar, som Breakit, Göteborgs-posten, eller i etermediers nyhetsändningar. Alla sådana engagemang förutsätter att de går utöver engagemanget som här utlovats.
Får du använda materialet?
Allt material kommer att publiceras under CC-BY-licens, vilket innebär att du får dela, bearbeta och publicera allt vi producerar och använda fritt - även kommersiellt. Detta för att vår journalistik ska få största möjliga spridning. Det enda vi kräver i retur är att du hänvisar källa, läs mer.
Hur får du delta?
Du får delta genom att tipsa, men inte styra över hur eller vad jag skriver. Oberoendet och självständigheten är fundamental. Givetvis kommer jag att vara lyhörd för vad som är intressant och aktuellt, men det är viktigt att framhålla hur heligt det journalistiska oberoendet är. Inte minst i en fråga där det finns många teorier om lobbyorganisationers arbete. Det är därför särskilt viktigt att framhålla att storleken på en eventuell gåva inte kommer ge större inflytande över den journalistik som produceras. Den som finansierar gör det på egen risk och utan möjlighet att direkt påverka vad eller hur jag skriver.
Hur länge ska pengarna räcka?
Projektet och därmed finansiering sträcker sig fram till Europaparlamentets avslutande votering angående Copyrightdirektivet i mars/april (datum är i skrivande stund inte satt av parlamentet - antagligen blir det 25-28 mars).

536,1915517104,"On a planet destined to keep throwing woes our way, I decided to give the world something to smile about.
How, you ask? Well, when my friend Stephanie Spong--president of the Tabor Opera House Preservation Foundation--asked me what I might do to help raise funds for the historic Opera House, she thought I might offer a respectable wine and cheese party in my old Victorian home.
She never saw the 2018 Calendar Girls of Leadville coming!
Although it would have been far easier to host an evening gala, the creation of this calendar--seven months in the making so far--has brought laughter and joy to the many volunteers who have donated their time and talents . . . and goosebumps.
Elise Sunday, local shop owner and photographer, didn't even wait for me get my full request out before saying, ""I want to be your photographer,"" and Karen Onderdonk, producer/director of this hilarious Indigo Media Arts video, asked if she could put together a short ""Making of the Calendar"" documentary!
Leadville is an old mining town and--much like our ""antique"" Calendar Girls--is in need of a little pick-me-up here and there. In its heyday late in the 1800s, the Opera House offered its visitors entertainers such as Harry Houdini, Oscar Wilde and Buffalo Bill. This building's the real deal, and you should see the upstairs ballroom! Just thinking about the once-rich and powerful people who waltzed upon its floors is enough to make you feel their spirits dancing there still!
Leadville's Historic Tabor Opera House, on Colorado's Endangered Places list, is a designated National Historic Treasure.
   I established the Leadville Literary League as a nonprofit organization to promote local literary endeavors and the arts, so helping to preserve a local treasure--this incredible historic building that has hosted literary giants and artists--seemed like a no-brainer.    
Every photo shoot we’ve done for this calendar project has been joyful because the women who have volunteered to bare more than their souls for it have brought with them their feisty, fun-loving spirits! All of the women are 50 and older, except for our December photo in which we ""gifted"" some younger lasses a place in the group.
   One of many possible photos you could see in this keepsake calendar! [photo by Elise Sunday]
   ...and maybe something like this eclipse day photo! [photo by Elise Sunday]
What I'm asking from you, kind potential supporters, is funding for the printing and distribution of this calendar. My inspiration for it, of course, was the 2003 film Calendar Girls, so our models for each month are ""tastefully uncovered,"" some with other dressed models . . . or perhaps a ghost!    
Meet Roxy, our demure, 4-legged star. Roxy's owner is a real Colorado cowgirl, and the two models (not shown here) in the photo shoot for this month's offering agreed to be ""tastefully uncovered""! [photo by Elise Sunday]
   My goals are to help save the Tabor by selling at least 1,000 calendars, to make you smile, and to give you something to look forward to in this wackadoodle world. Please help me reach my goals!

Resurface is a documentary about military veterans who use surf therapy to cope with PTSD and transform their lives.  It is the next documentary from the award-winning filmmaking team that made Slomo, a NY Times Op-Doc and winner of a dozen jury and audience awards, including SXSW, AFI Docs, and Sheffield Doc Festival.
Visit our website: www.resurfacethemovie.com
We are making this film because 1 in 3 combat troops report symptoms of PTSD, and only about 40% seek help. With your help, we hope this film raises awareness about this critical issue and inspires Veterans, or frankly anyone else, suffering from physical and psychological difficulties to seek out the therapeutic benefits of being in and around water.
Your donation will help pay for the additional filming we have left to do and for the film's post-production work!
What Is This Film About?
While on tour in Iraq as a U.S. Marine Corps infantryman, Bobby Lane suffered two traumatic brain injuries when his platoon was hit by 5 roadside bombs in 11 days. Upon returning home, he suffered from PTSD and sleepless nights filled with nightmares. It got so bad that he planned to kill himself. But first he wanted to cross a final item off his bucket list: surfing.
Bobby traveled from Texas to California for a week of surfing with Operation Surf. Bobby's time in the water saved his life. His plan had been to commit suicide upon returning to Texas, but he says that surfing brought him newfound peace. He explains: 
""Now I see it, if life gets too hard, there's always the ocean.""
How Can Surfing Change Lives?      
This film explores the answer to that question. More and more research has demonstrated the healing power of surfing on the brain and body. Organizations like the Jimmy Miller Memorial Foundation, Operation Surf and Surf Action are now acting on this research, turning to ocean therapy to help active duty Marines and Vets like Bobby cope with physical and mental trauma. Resurface focuses on these Vets and explores how surfing and the ocean are helping them heal.
Why Teach Veterans to Surf?
Surf therapy sessions give Veterans an opportunity to learn to surf in a safe and supportive environment. The intense focus and strenuous work required to surf allows individuals to take their minds off life's stresses and be completely engaged in the moment. Overcoming the challenges (and often fear) of being in the ocean leaves Veterans with a renewed sense of self-efficacy and confidence. One Vet shared: 
""If I just learned to surf, what else can I do?""
Central to our film is the work being done by the Jimmy Miller Memorial Foundation (""JMMF"") and Operation Surf, two nonprofits that provide Veterans with surf therapy sessions. These organizations deserve a lot of credit for implementing this innovative treatment. Your support of our film will go a long way in highlighting the great work of groups like JMMF, Operation Surf and Surf Action to ensure they continue to get the support they need to carry on their heroic efforts.
So while surfing will by no means cure PTSD, ongoing research shows that it helps alleviate the symptoms of PTSD and provides combat Vets with a healthy outlet to replace the adrenaline and action of combat.
Why Back A Film About Vets And Surf Therapy?
1 in 3 combat Veterans report symptoms of PTSD, and only about 40% seek help. By supporting this film, you will be helping spread the word about the therapeutic benefits of the ocean. This is a relatively new treatment for PTSD and we hope this film increases awareness about surf therapy. 
By backing this project, you can play a role in inspiring Veterans, or frankly anyone else, suffering from physical and psychological difficulties to seek out opportunities for rehabilitation through whatever programs are available to them. 
And ultimately, on a grand scale, we need your help to use the power of film to demonstrate the growing body of evidence for something many who spend time in and around the water already know intuitively: surfing, and the ocean, are curative.

How Will Your Donation Be Used?
Your donation will help pay for the additional filming we have left to do and for the film's post-production work:
We still have a few more Veterans to interview and we also need to film them out in the water surfing. We need to travel to LA to make that happen and the costs of multiple trips with our crew and gear add up quickly. Your support of our project will mean we will finally have the funds to complete all the filming for the documentary.
Once we've done all the filming, your donation will help us with our post-production work (often the most expensive part of the process). We have to hire an editor to assist us in putting all of the footage together. Then there's creating the score for the film, performing the color correction, and possibly animations too. All that can cost a significant amount, which is why your support will be so meaningful.
Finally, your donation will be used to make sure we can get the film seen by as many people as possible. If we reach our funding goal with your help, we will enter the film into film festivals. But more importantly, we also hope to screen the film for free at various Veterans organizations and VA hospitals in order to inform other Veterans about ocean therapy. Your donations have the power to let others know about this valuable form of therapy."

541,477851481,"MAKE 100: Hand-Pressed Modern Art Prints
Add an original, modern art print to your collection for the price of a decent pizza. Featuring pops of colour, abstract shapes, and the mystery of not knowing exactly what you'll get, as each print will be one of a kind. 
 I could not resist Kickstarter's siren call to #Make100, so I am spending the next few months playing with a new print I love to see what else I can make using the same idea. The result will be 100 (good ones!) bright and cheerful prints that I would love to share with you. Each one will be a little different but all will be based on the same idea. I will be playing with textures, colours and shapes, and I am really excited to see where I can take this. If you like art AND suspiciously low IKEA prices, this project is for YOU! You will get an original piece of art for a steal of a deal and I will get an expanded tool collection and keep my art stash from taking over the ENTIRE living room (because, quite frankly, that's what my loom is for and that job is already taken).
Why Prints?
I fell in love with printmaking three years ago when I wandered into a printmaker's studio in a small town in France. Until that moment, I had no idea a piece of dated flooring could be turned into a magical, whimsical universe full of colour and life (I am talking about linoleum - the exact same stuff you can still find in old diners and retro kitchens). Until then, I thought of prints as a way to buy someone's artwork when you can't quite afford the original. Suddenly, prints were holding their own and doing things other art forms never could. I was smitten and found a printmaking class as soon as I got home, where a new (to me) pastime was born.  
  Why MY prints
The most exciting part of printmaking for me is not the ability to make numerous copies of the same print (no matter how stunning), but rather the opportunity to make truly one-of-a-kind pieces just like ""real art"" (no, we will not call those people snobs). Yes, with printmaking! No, I'm not making this up. I know, my mind was blown too. This is precisely what I'm making, so you can get one too! 
I also think I have a pretty killer eye for colour (even if I don't know - yet! - how to mix the exact colours I want) and composition, and I have made some pretty stellar prints before (#humblebrag). 
Sounds intriguing? Let me tell you more! 
I would love to tell you all about what the final prints will look like but that's the part I don't actually know yet. I have a really great print I'm starting with (the tall looker below that I'm totally crushing on!) and a very clear concept of the elements I would like to use: transparent ink, overlapping elements, intersecting colours, graphic shapes. Where it goes from there, I'm not entirely sure, as the prints aren't going to all be the same (and I am bound to have at least a couple more brilliant ideas while printing a whole stack of them!).  
My very first lino print on the left; the print style you can expect on the right
 What I can do is show you what I've made before to give you a better idea of where I've been and where I'm going (thanks, Kickstarter, for the stellar freeze frame that I am unable to edit!). 
PLAY

Where you come in: 
Making 100 prints would really help me explore this newly-discovered (for me) approach to relief printing and learn to mix the colours I actually want (and not make accidentally while trying to do something else). This means a LOT of test prints and experimenting (hello beautiful printmaking paper that's worth every penny!). It also means working with a lot more colours at a time, which requires a significantly expanded collection of inking tools. Finally, I would love to find new homes for all the prints I am going to make (because I really don't have THAT much wall space that isn't already covered in artwork, and sharing is caring). Playtime for me, artwork for you - I think it's a win-win! 
What you can expect: 
Because I am still developing this style and experimenting heavily, I don't know for sure what the finished prints will look like, except that they will all be a little (or a lot) different. I've done my best to show you what my previous work looks like and where my mind is at now. If you are willing to trust me a little (and take a tiny risk that involves absolutely no illegal activities), I would love to send you something in a few months that may or may not look a little something like this: 

When can you get your hands on one of these modern beauts? 
June or August, depending on how early you sign up. I will be stocking up on tools and supplies and carving up stacks of linoleum like there's no tomorrow in February and March. Then it will be a printing bonanza until all the prints are out the door and on YOUR walls (or perched on the toilet tank, if that's your fancy; I don't judge). 
What do you say? Are you in?"

""You are as powerful and as strong as you allow yourself to be, and the most difficult part of any endeavor is taking the first step, making the first decision.""                                                    - Robyn Davidson, Tracks
My name is Rick Smolan and I'm a former Time, Life, and National Geographic photojournalist. When I was twenty-eight, National Geographic Magazine sent me on the assignment of a lifetime: to document the 1,700 mile journey of a mysterious twenty-seven-year-old woman named Robyn Davidson, who was trekking across the Australian outback alone with four camels and her dog, Diggity.  During Robyn’s nine-month journey I tracked her down five times, spending about three months traveling with her and shooting tens of thousands of photographs.
""Australia harbors more things that can kill you in extremely nasty ways than anywhere else""        - Bill Bryson,  In a Sunburned Country
I was fascinated by Robyn's courage and her intense desire to learn from Aboriginals about their culture.  I had never witnessed a love affair like the one she had with her Kelpie pup, Digitty (who she had rescued as a puppy from an animal testing lab two years before her trip began).  And I was constantly amazed by her perspective on life, on friendship and her brutal honesty with her own short comings. Most of all I was fascinated to spend time with someone who, instead of running away from her fears, faced them head on, constantly challenging herself. 
Even though Robyn had spent two years preparing, the outback had many ways of testing even the most capable traveler; she was attacked by wild camels, took paths that led to dead ends, got lost, arrived at wells that were dry and almost died of dehydration. Every time I left her out there, I worried that I might never see her again. 
When Robyn’s story appeared in a 32-page cover story in National Geographic it caught the world’s imagination, reaching over 50 million readers.
TRACKS (the book): Robyn went on to write a book called TRACKS which her publisher expected to sell modestly, with an initial print run of only a few thousand copies. TRACKS went on to become a global phenomenon, selling more than a million copies in 18 languages. It won the ""Thomas Cook Travel Writing Award"" and the ignominious honor of being the year's “Most Stolen Book”!
This description from TRACKS is a wonderful overview of why her story has captivated readers around the globe:
""Robyn Davidson went to the dead heart of Australia in pursuit of a dream: to cross the desert alone.  Her journey took her across an ancient, secret land and the outback worked its magic on her life in strange and subtle ways. From an Aboriginal tribal elder Robyn learned desert sense, and from an Afghan camel herder she learnt to master, ride, outwit and care for the camels that became her pack animals and adored companions.
Her voyage led to the discovery of self as well as to the profound beauty and nobility of a threatened land and its indigenous people.""
TRACKS (the movie): Given the power of Robyn's writing, I shouldn't have been surprised when the Oscar-winning producers of The Kings Speech reached out and told me they were going to turn Robyn’s legendary adventure into a feature film.  They cast Mia Wasikowska, a wonderful twenty-four-year-old chameleon-like actress (Alice in Wonderland) as Robyn, and Adam Driver (Lena Dunham's heartthrob boyfriend in HBO’s GIRLS ) as yours truly, the photojournalist.  
Here is the trailer for the movie, TRACKS, which begins reaching theaters this fall.
The movie is being distributed by the legendary Weinstein Company and has been generating rave reviews around the globe.
Which brings me to my Kickstarter Campaign for a brand new book I'm producing called INSIDE TRACKS:
INSIDE TRACKS:  When I found out that Robyn’s story was being transformed into a feature film I called Robyn and we brainstormed the idea of my self-publishing a large 224-page landscape coffee-table book (30-inches wide when open) which would enable readers to feel as if they are joining Robyn on her journey.  
She loved the idea and we came up with a book that would weave together three experience of her journey: memorable quotes from her book TRACKS, the best of my photos plus striking images and screenplay from the TRACKS movie.  
INSIDE TRACKS is three books in one:
1) The first half of the book is a visual story using my images, many of which have never been seen before, and inspiring quotes from Robyn’s best-selling memoir, TRACKS. 
INSIDE TRACKS featuring images from Robyn's original journey

2) The second half of the book features fascinating images from the movie TRACKS, screenplay excerpts, behind the scenes / making-of images, as well as short essays reflecting on the journey written by Robyn, John Curran the director of the movie, and by me (Rick Smolan).
INSIDE TRACKS featuring scenes from the movie

The images in this section were shot by Matt Nettheim, a fantastically talented set photographer, and Mandy Walker the film’s Director of Photography. Because many of the film's scenes were based on my original photos, it’s almost impossible to tell which images are from the movie and which are from the original trek.
3) The most delightful component of INSIDE TRACKS is the integration of  HP’s Aurasma technology. Readers will be invited to download a free smartphone app (available on iTunes & Google Play). You simply point your phone or tablet at specially marked photos and immediately (and I mean immediately) you’ll see a clip from the movie showing how that photograph was brought to life in the TRACKS movie. 
Use of Funds
INSIDE TRACKS is a labor of love.
My son Jesse proudly displaying an early sample of INSIDE TRACKS
I envisioned INSIDE TRACKS being printed on heavy matte paper in six colors (most books are printed in only four) plus a spot varnish on every photograph to make the color pop off the page. 
I pitched the concept of INSIDE TRACKS to many publishers but, while many shared my enthusiasm for the book, I couldn’t find any publisher that would commit to the quality of production that I felt this book deserved. 
So, I am turning to the Kickstarter community to help fund the considerable expenses involved in self-publishing and publicizing INSIDE TRACKS.
Special Heavy Duty Kickstarter Edition Mailing Carton
INSIDE TRACKS is not like most of the illustrated books you find in stores these days. Most publishers are very conservative  - they play it safe, keep costs down, and think that ""average"" quality is good enough. INSIDE TRACKS is not going to be average, it’s going to be spectacular. The book will integrate a level of printing and production quality that you rarely see in bookstores anymore.
To achieve this goal I had all of the original Kodachrome slides drum scanned at extremely high resolution and tasked Michael Marquand, a color correction wizard to optimize each image. Diane Murray, a wonderfully talented art director and designer, spent months seamlessly weaving together the original trek photographs, the images from the movie, and the new Aurasma App technology that brings the original images to life. Brad Zucroff, a printing expert, is supervising the print run.
Finally, I've engaged Holly Jacobus, a brilliant marketer, to focus on raising awareness of INSIDE TRACKS in the publishing, photography, film, technology, and smart device communities.
If funds are raised in excess of my goal (fingers crossed!) the money will be used to expand the awareness of INSIDE TRACKS through additional marketing and publicity plans throughout the upcoming holiday season.
My greatest hope is that INSIDE TRACKS will help expand the audience for Robyn’s inspiring story and the underlying message of her journey, that “an ordinary person is capable of anything”.

545,729972385,"Hi, I'm Phil with Cape Horn Illustration. I'm an illustrator based in Chicago with a passion for architecture and bird's eye view maps. I put it all together here by creating two distinct, illustrated bird's eye view maps that celebrate Chicago's beautiful lakefront.
The Maps
There are two maps. Both of these are finished (!) and just need to be sent to print. Here are the details of each: 
The Eastward Lakefront Map, which faces Lake Michigan and focuses on the lakefront's sites, such as the various beaches, landmarks, and lakefront trail. I had always thought it would be great to make a map that illustrated the 20+ miles of the city's lakefront, and this is the outcome of that effort.
The Westward Lakefront Map. This one faces the city and focuses on the city skyline and parks along the water's edge. I had spent a year creating a black and white version a few years back (""Lakefront Currents""), and this will improve on that, as a brand new, full-color print edition.
Again: Both of these are finished and print-ready! 
The Process & Printing
The process that will be used is offset lithography. This process, invented in the late 1800's, led to a huge surge in the production and availability of large-format prints, including bird's eye view maps of American cities and towns. 
The printer I will use, Chicago Press Corporation, is an institution in Chicago printing. It was founded in 1927 and has stayed under ownership of the same family. In my experience working with them, they have an unparalleled attention to detail and quality.
The Paper
These prints will be made on Mohawk Via - 65# Natural Linen Via Cover. This is a beautiful linen paper, a slight off-white, which shows the texture of fine threads. Here's a closeup of the paper:
 Putting it all together
When the Kickstarter is finished, I'll send this to print and work with Chicago Press Corp to make sure the end-product looks fantastic. I'll ship the prints in sleeves and placed in a hard, cardboard mailing tube. It's something I've done many times before.
Thank you for supporting the project!"
546,807576231,"Hello! I am a freelance illustrator based in Knutsford, UK. My artwork is inspired by my passion for animals (that's my rabbit Renly!) but also my love of folklore and fantasy. 
I've always been captivated by the rabbit folklore in Watership Down, and it's one of my all time favourite books. It inspired me to create this illustration featuring Fiver and Hazel along with the other rabbits from Sandleford warren, looking out towards the high lonely hills of Watership Down. 
Lord Frith the sun – creator of the universe - can be seen on the horizon, his rays staining the horizon red like Fiver’s vision of a field covered with blood – the vision that caused the rabbits to leave Sandleford warren and set out on an adventure to find a new home. 
The Black Rabbit of Inlé is the grim reaper of the rabbit world, serving Lord Frith by taking rabbits away at the predestined time of their death. He can be seen in the foreground floating amongst the woundwort plants, foreshadowing what is to come on their journey.
El-ahrairah
Originally I also intended El-ahrairah to be featured in the illustration, but unfortunately the image became too cluttered to fit him in as well. El-ahrairah is the prince of rabbits, his name meaning ‘prince with a thousand enemies’ in lapine. Rabbits tell stories of his adventures, learning tricks from his cunning ways that help them to survive in the wild.
I recently returned to my unfinished illustration of El-ahrairah and finally completed him!  
The Pin Designs
I was disappointed that El-ahrairah didn't fit into the original illustration so I really want to create something to celebrate him. I love designing pins and thought that he would make a great set along with the Black Rabbit of Inlé.
Both pins will be hard enamel with metal clutch fixings on the back. The base metal of the El-ahrairah pin will be gold, and it will be 40 mm at it’s longest side. The Black Rabbit pin will have a silver base metal and it will be 50 mm at it’s longest side. They will come fixed on backing cards and packaged in protective bio-degradable bags.

Other Rewards
Alongside the pins my Watership Down illustration is available as an A3 (42 x 29.7cm) giclée print.
A3 Giclée Print
These giclée prints are printed in the UK using lightfast pigment inks on smooth 300gsm 100% cotton archival white matt finish paper, giving them a longevity of approx 100 years (under glass) and colours that really pop! The paper is FSC certified and will be posted rolled in a sturdy postal tube. 
As El-ahrairah is not featured in this print he is also available as an A4 (29.7 x 21cm) inkjet print. 
A4 Print
These are printed on lovely thick 270 gsm, ""Natural"" (slightly off white) FSC certified card.
All pledges up to the value of £20 will be posted by 1st Class within the UK and by standard airmail outside the UK. Any pledges over £20 will be posted 1st Class Signed For within the UK and by International Tracked & Signed outside the UK.

Watch this video to see a story about a special dog who is living happily ever after because of Home To Home™  and Dr. Marty Becker, ""America's Veterinarian"", author and founder of Fear Free Pets who endorses the program.
 Another success story about a blind dog who needed a new home:
  How is Home To Home different from other online pet rehoming option?
  Home To Home™ is a non-profit pet rehoming program that saves pets' lives by partnering with animal shelters to keep animals in loving homes, before ever having to enter the animal shelter system.
Everyday, people are faced with difficult decisions. Sometimes, this means having to find a new home for their pet.  If you’ve ever been in that situation, it can be hard to know where to turn. Can you take your animal to a shelter? Yes. Is there a better way? Also, yes.
Animal shelters are run by wonderful people who love animals. Unbeknownst to many, overcrowding in animal shelters is an issue that many shelters face. Because of this, animals can -  and are -  euthanized for space. Home To Home™ wants to help change that.
What we need, and why we’re asking for your help
We need 150K for our first round of funding. This will cover:
A complete website rebuild. As Home To Home™ grows and scales, we need to be able to meet our growing needs and our current platform is not equipped to keep pace with this growth.
  Your contribution could result in saving thousands of pets lives by allowing us to upgrade our platform, which will allow us to be in more shelters nationwide.
  Home To Home™ serves people and pets in the following ways:
Benefits your local shelter
Allows your local shelter to offer Home To Home™ as an alternative to surrendering their pet to the shelter. This allows for more space for other animals that have no other option: strays, emergencies, protective custody, etc.
  Benefits the animal
Animal shelters exist for a reason, and their need in our community is important. As nice as animal welfare personnel strive to make the animals’ experience as positive as possible, it still causes stress and anxiety for the animal. By bypassing the shelter, they never have to experience this stress of entering the shelter system.
  Benefits the current owner
When life circumstances happen and people realize the best place for their pet is no longer with them, it can be devastating. Taking your animal to a shelter is not only stressful for the pet, it’s equally stressful for the family!
  When current owners rehome their pet via Home To Home™, THEY get to choose the next home for their pet, which is a very comforting feeling for the current pet owner. They know their pet better than anyone, so they are really the best source to pick their pet’s next home/family.
  Benefits the future adopter
The future adopter gets to meet the current owner first hand, ask any questions they may have, learn about behavior and medical history, do a meet and greet with their existing pets, etc.  This doesn’t always happen when adopting directly from a shelter.
  Let’s be the change. Let’s support current owners in their rehoming efforts, not shame them for having to rehome their pet. Let’s spare the shelter so that resources and space can be used for animals that don’t have any other option. When you use and adopt via Home To Home™, you are helping your local animal shelter, your community - and your current or future pet!
How does it work?
An animal shelter joins the Home To Home™ program, receives training, creates their customized Home To Home™ website, and promotes the program.
  When a pet owner contacts the shelter needing to rehome their pet, the shelter offers Home To Home™ as a solution.
  The pet owner creates a pet profile and the shelter or rescue promotes the pet on Home To Home™ which is integrated with the organization’s Facebook page.
  When a potential adopter is interested in the pet, they communicate directly with the pet owner.
  The pet owner screens the potential adopter and decides if they are a good fit to adopt their pet.
  When the pet owner chooses an adopter, the pet goes from one home to the other, without ever entering a shelter.
  What makes Home To Home™ different than other rehoming programs?
No adoption fees are ever exchanged.
  Shelters partner with their communities to rehome pets.
  Pets are promoted across broad networks, instead of just within a pet owners’ network.
  Home To Home™ looks at rehoming differently. It was started by a shelter, for shelters. We understand the challenges that shelters face, and the challenges that owners face when making the decision that the best life for their pet is no longer with them.
Home to Home™ is managed and operated at each individual shelter. This provides the best results for both their community and pets. Shelters are the trusted resource in their community, they can provide services and advice to help keep pets in homes or provide a better transition into a new home. Plus, people in the community who are interested in adopting are already looking at the shelter for potential pets so pets on Home To Home™ have a greater chance of being seen and adopted.
  We exist to
Help pets and the people who love them.
  Keep pets out of shelters and in loving homes, so that shelters can apply resources to other animals in their care that have no other option.
  We do this by
Partnering with shelters to add Home To Home™ to their programs that are focused on supporting their community and keeping pets in homes and outside the shelter. This allows Home To Home™ to be operated at a local level which increases engagement at a community level (vs. a national blanketed website).
  Focusing on solutions, not fear, judgment or worst-possible outcomes.
  Why this matters
We have almost four years of data and experience to demonstrate this approach works. We want to share it with the world (starting in the United States).
Our Story
Home To Home™ was founded by Panhandle Animal Shelter (PAS), an animal shelter located in Sandpoint, Idaho. PAS serves over 8,000 animals each year through its shelter operations and programs aimed at keeping pets in their homes where they belong.
In 2015, PAS experienced a big increase in the number of people surrendering their pets to the shelter. They wanted to seek a better solution for owners and their pets. PAS started Home To Home™ as a pilot program with the goal of helping people rehome their pets instead of turning them into the shelter.
“We knew our social media platforms reached a lot of people so we decided to create a website where pet owners could post their pets when they needed to rehome them. We wanted to truly support pet owners so we made sure the website integrated with our organizations Facebook page so we could promote the pets to all of our followers,” said Mandy Evans, Executive Director of PAS.  “Immediately after launching the pilot, we experienced fewer people surrendering their pets to the shelter and more people trying out the program. Honestly, our community LOVED IT. People who had to rehome liked talking to new potential families and the new adopters enjoyed having the opportunity to hear all about the pets before accepting them into their homes. Plus, the shelter experienced a 31% decrease in owner surrenders!, “said Evans.
With such promising outcomes, PAS wanted other shelters to know about the program. Today, 17 shelters in 13 states are using the program, and all are experiencing positive results. But, this is just the beginning of what is possible. Using current adoption and euthanasia data its projected that if all shelters in the United States used Home To Home™, we would experience a significant reduction in the euthanasia of healthy or treatable dogs or cats in shelters.

Hey everyone,
Like dozens upon dozens of performers, collectors and writers, I am hoping to start a new podcast this summer - ""A Tight 45"" – named after the amount of time a headlining comedian is required to do at minimum at a comedy club. But my podcast won't just be about comedy - it will cover, music, pop culture, social issues, sports, gardening - yes, even gardening - and more! I've already talked to some great preliminary guests (you won't believe some of the people that have already agreed to do it), so all I need now is the moolah/paper/dead presidents/greenbacks/funds/money to make it happen by having the capital to buy (1) a high quality USB microphone; (2) hosting space on a server where I can upload it to your favorite outlets like iTunes and (3) take care of all the Kickstarter taxes!
That's it! "

The artist/author and the book:
Hello, my name is Veta Bakhtina. A lot of folks that will see this are friends, (Hi friends!) but if not, please feel free to see my bio here: https://vetabakhtina.com/bio/ and thank you for being here! As a child of a literary family, my inspiration for The Magic Traveling Bunk Bed came from having access to many books growing up. I was very very lucky. We had a library of children's books at home that were translated into Russian from all over the world by two little old ladies that lived in a smokey apartment down town St. Petersburg and were very close with my Grandmother. The books had incredible illustrations, and some had none, and my imagination soared! This book is a product of so many influences and a lifetime of imagery. And theres so much more where that came from. I was very fortunate to have an incredible author Kiana Donahue work on a rewrite of the story. Kiana Lowe is a writer, performer, and farmworker on Chumash land in California. She writes science fiction, fantasy, and non-fiction with an interest in social transformation, personal power, and ecology. You can find her work at kianalowe.com.
Expenses and where your contribution goes:
The funds raised by your generous support go directly to printing costs. The book was created by the author/illustrator over a three year span, beginning with pointillism pen and ink illustrations and a back and forth writing and drawing process to complete the 5k word work. Coloring the 28 illustrations with watercolor, and lastly a rigorous stage of editing and rewriting.
Printing costs require $4,550. This amount funds the total of the printing and binding of the beautiful hard cover books.
The shipping is a separate charge of $1,465. 
That brings the total to a little over $6,000. Our funding goal of $4,500 will help fund a huge chunk of this total. Thank you so much! please spread the word, It wouldn't be possible without you! "
550,615576298,"Hello my name is Rashad Crews and I am a graduate student working towards a Master of Fine Arts Degree from the City College of New York. I am an emerging filmmaker writing and directing my first feature film and thesis final called Ice Prince. I started writing this script over 12 years ago before I ever considered film school. I began to take Ice Prince seriously while working on my undergraduate degree at Touro College here in New York City. I pulled out the script and really began to refine the story. The main character Kitare has evolved as I have evolved. Currently, City College has given me the opportunity to shoot this film. They have also provided a platform for me to showcase it. Ice Prince will be featured at The Student Oscar Awards. The Student Oscars are closely linked to the official Oscar Awards which recognizes outstanding actors, films, and filmmakers. The Student Oscar Awards winners will have the opportunity to hand out an Oscar Award at the annual ceremony held in Los Angeles, California. In addition to the Student Oscar Awards I will also submit my work to four Indie Film Festivals in 2018. These festivals include: The 13th Annual New York City Short Film Festival 2018; The 3rd Annual PUSH! Film Festival 2018; Brooklyn Film Festival June, 2-11, 2018, and the 15th Annual DIY Film Festival March 19-31, 2018. Ice Prince is set in summer NY. The film is centered around a young up and coming rapper named Kitare 'K-Mack' Sands. Kitare wants to leave his turbulent past behind to pursue a career in the music industry. While working on his dream he amassed a huge debt of S11,000 for instrumentals to produce songs for his upcoming independent album. The producer of the album who has loaned Kitare the money has given him only 72 hours to return the money. Kitare has no way of returning the money in such a short period of time and has exhausted all of his legitimate resources to earn enough money to pay the money back, so he is forced to get the money by any means necessary. He has found a way to get the money he needs, but he will have to cheat on his long term girlfriend Renee to get it. Meanwhile, his girlfriend has been sneaking behind his back working as a prostitute for money to help him pay off his debt. The twist in this story is the same friend helping Renee get money is the same friend that told Kitare he couldn't lend him anything. The story of Ice Prince was influenced by actual events that took place in my life, from stories that I heard growing in the Bronx, New York and from movies like “Hustle and Flow” and Eight Mile. I know that the viewers will be impressed and inspired by the story and the attention to detail as it relates to the characters, the scenery, and the overall effort that it takes to produce a film like this. As a student my resources are limited so it is imperative that I ask for help from the community to get this project off of the ground. I estimate that the total cost to produce the film will be about $7,625.00 to complete it by the deadline for submission. I am asking for any help that you can give to help me make Ice Prince a success. I have $4,900.00 from student loans, credit cards, and personal savings invested in this film. I have provided a breakdown of the services that are needed during production, and the final cost of each service.Please see table on page 2: 
Ice Prince Production Costs Services Cost Breakdown Total Cost 
Entertainment Studios $60.00/hour x 5 hours x 5 days $1,500.00 
Wardrobe Stylist $25.00/hour x 8 hours x 5 days $1,000.00

Assistant Camera $500.00 Flat Rate $500.00 
 Final Cost $7,625.00 
 In closing I would like to thank you for taking the time to read this proposal and for your consideration for support of this project. I have exciting gifts for my donors once my goal is met. I am excited for this opportunity to bring this film to the public. Any support will help and will be greatly appreciated. Thank you. I look forward to presenting Ice Prince to you and the world!"

552,1384002216,"Due to the Covid 19 pandemic, people from  all walks of life have suddenly found themselves struggling to survive financially. One of these Groups are street artists and musicians, with lock down procedures in place, high streets and tourist destinations have become virtual ghosts towns throughout the world. This group in particular would have relied on income from performing in town centres and tourist areas.  We created MYGIG in an attempt to alleviate some of this stress, by creating a platform for  these artists to take their performances online and showcase themselves to the world.  Our platform is unique as it offers the opportunity  for  artists to receive payment when their performance is viewed on MYGIG - just as they would when performing on the street  
Covid19 has forced us to change the way we operate. Businesses and individuals around the globe have had to restructure operations in order to survive - MYGIG brings to life the opportunity for street performers
MYGIG enables people to support the artist when watching performances by way of giving money - therefore giving the artist / performer income. viewers can decide how much they wish to give, from anything as little as 50 pence. MYGIG will also allow viewers to book online private performances , MYGIG online festivals and purchase digital albums from their favourite MYGIG artists - allowing the artists multiple income channels.  There is also opportunity for performers to earn money from advertising revenue, whereby the more views an individual has , the higher percentage of ad revenue they will earn.
Our goal is to make MYGIG the worlds number one platform for artists and musicians to perform to the world with the potential to become the next rising global sensation"

Why am I doing this? Ever since I was a wee little child, I've had a strong passion for art. I honestly can't get enough of it. This will be my first time collaborating with a wide audience in creating something unique for everyone. When you fund this project, I will be able to afford additional art supplies to continue this passion of mine (and maybe some lunch)!
What can I do for you? It's quite simple actually. I craft unique watercolour portrait pieces, which I put a lot of work into (in most cases pulling all-nighters). What I'll need from you is a high-resolution headshot of yourself, or of a person whom you truly adore, and just send that to my e-mail, which is contact.rosandrew@gmail.com.
There are 3 styles that you can choose from (digital $10/printed $20): 
Style 1: Realistic Portrait
A watercolour portrait of Margaret Qualley.
 Style 2: Exaggerated/Surprise Face Portrait
Oh my!
 Style 3: Abstract/Unusual Twist Portrait
Funky colours for you or your friends.
 Here are more examples of my work:

I created this campaign not only to further support the creation of more original works in the coming months, including works inspired by a few of the available designs! But first, I need to cover the upfront costs of getting them made, and I can’t do it without your help!
 Because I would like to see all of these designs made, and lessen the risk of not being able to offer anything at all, I will be offering stretch goals. Help me meet more fundraising goals to unlock more designs!  If you'd like additional items, you will be able to add them later in the backer survey.

Once the campaign is finished, you will be able to add additional items to your orders via a survey that is sent out to every backer. Add-ons can include additional pins, and prints!

 My name is Abigail Grigg, and welcome to my Kickstarter campaign! I have been drawing and sketching ever since I was a kid and loved it so much I committed to making it my life's work. I graduated from Brigham Young University in 2016 with a Bachelor's degree in Fine Arts. Since then, I have gone on to create concept art and game designs for companies such as Disney, Pokemon, Poptropica, and various freelancers.

WORKS NOT IN PROGRESS is a compilation of some of my favorite sketches and brainstorming pieces. It will be printed by BLURB as an 8.5 x 11 premium book with 75 pages of content. The majority of the book will be sketches with a few colored pieces sprinkled here and there. My team and I have been working hard over the last several months to ensure we bring you only the best quality for this book.
Over the course of my career I've looked up to other artists and creators as they released their own art books and platforms to teach, showcase, and inspire artist such as myself. Now, I would like to contribute with my own artwork. I hope that with this art book I can touch, inspire, and help individuals as they go through their own creative struggles to grow as artists and creators. Although I myself am still doing some of that growing, I hope to put a little bit more inspiration into the world. 
 We have a lot of stretch goals we'd love to hit, including extra pages, charms, and enamel pins. However, that can only happen if we get the word out and share this campaign with the world. Below are a few links to my blogs and social media pages where you can see my work and spread the campaign to your friends and family. Do you know somebody who would love this book? Don't be shy to share this campaign with them!


 Thank you so much for giving me the time to read through my campaign. I hope to see your pledge soon so we can deliver the best version of the art book to your front door.

I will create a photo series that shows the absurdity of vulgarities as well as showing where these words come from. I believe that it is asinine that we, as a society, say that some words are good and others are bad. I want to highlight these ""vulgar"" words by photographing scenes that explore their many meanings, uses and their histories. The pieces will be controversial and many will revile them as vulgar. This is the intended effect. I want people to become uncomfortable. I want people to have a discussion. I want people to question societal norms. I want people to think. These pieces will be shown in Denver, in Texas and where ever else there is a need for conversation. I want them to be available on-line and through the media.
This is a project emphasizing the power and need for our First Amendment Right of Freedom of Speech.

559,184641310,"Our plan
Our plan is to make a mobile game, one that can make a good profit and be fun. Our main target will be Android smartphones. That project has a name: High Five App The Revolution. We are now making a trailer about the team and I am sure the app is going to be something special. The initial plan is finished and we have a very good rockband Dubioza Kolektiv ( 1.000.000 people saw their videoclip on Youtube ) who will work with us to get the best experience possible in the app. The band members are my friends, so they will also help with the promotion in July.
We can not tell you much about the project yet since it is still in the early beginnings, only that 1 out of 20 Dutch citizens will buy this app.
We have planned a second upgrade and a third one shortly after we release the app. That would be around December 2015.
The age of our clients will be from 14 years to 54 years. So we know for sure that the game will be one of the most spoken things as soon it hits the app market.
The team
We are a very dedicated young team of game makers, consisting of programmers, game artists, marketing specialists, professional music artists, and we will bring something new to the world.
What I like about this project is the fact that this team is a multi cultural team. Also the fact that the team has a big varity in ages. Our youngest helpers in this project are around 19 years old and some are 30 years or older.
My friends and my helpers are:
Emma - Multi media designer / game developer
Alexander - Draughtsman / game developer
Sanne - Architect / Auto CAD specialist
Tom - Draughtsman
Hidde - Multi media designer
Adisa - Marketing / Administration
Jacob - Designer
Maarten - Marketing
Dubioza Kolektiv - Music from the album Wild, Wild East
If you have any questions, please ask. I can tell you a lot about myself and about the people who are working with me to realize this project, but I can not tell you too much about the project yet. Though a trailer is coming soon!
Why we need the money
First of all, the software. Which software we will be using depends on how much money we will earn with this Kickstarter campaign. We also need money to distribute the game through the Google Play store and we are looking into the possibilities of iOS.
We also want to make a videoclip about the app. We want to make this videoclip very professional, so our clients can see the effort we made.  My friends from the music band will also help with the video clip and we will post it on Youtube.
Thanks for reading about our new project. If this compaign succeed, we will give you for free a app about home decoration."
560,2137525018,"Our Story: After years of collaboration, We came together in the spring of 2015 with a group of women for the Scarlet Crow Remembrance Tour. We spent months preparing for this tour, to hold a ceremonial music container to serve as a think-tank for subjects that were near and dear to our hearts. We spoke about subjects of our history, lifting the rug on aspects of cultural slumber, especially around the silencing and renewal of the feminine.
After having a successful tour, we decided to record a collection of songs. Many of the songs we took on the road to serve as a document of the prayers we made and continue to make.
Story of the Album: In January of this year, we recorded these 12 songs in our humble bedroom studio over 4 days. We sent a few songs over to Barry Phillips, who added gorgeous cello arrangements. We called in David Earl to help produce and mix one of the tracks, and then gave the rest of these songs to Yaegon of Kalya Scintilla, who supported the song's flourishing with his masterful sound-wizarding ways. After a few weeks in the melting pot with Yaegon, these songs are cooked and ready to taste.
We are now bringing them to the center of our community, and calling for your support in helping us fund the rest of our process. 
Will you help us in our ""Remembrance"" ??
 Why support us? We believe in the power of authentic and vulnerable storytelling to open up important dialogues in our community that are imperative for the shift into a thriving life for the future of this planet. The atmosphere and alchemy we create as a duo offers a unique doorway into many of the important underbelly issues, while holding space for them to integrate in a beautiful and nourishing way. We believe in the power of women standing together, uniting in song and voice, to create waves of immeasurable change across the lands. We take our combined craft and create an all inclusive community of men, women and everything in between to become better allies through learning and exploration.
Why are we doing a Kickstarter?
We are running a kickstarter for this album because it is a great way to connect with our immediate tribe of supporters. We feel that through the power of crowd funding, we can continue to support our community in the best way we know how: by creating compelling art. In response, our community can support us in crafting it by chipping in for the production expenses in exchange for unique, awesome incentives!

Funding Goals:

562,651610977," Backers at reward levels that include shippable items: Kickstarter does not give us your address! After every campaign, we need to collect your shipping information. If you don't use our Pledge Manager to tell us, we don't know where to send your rewards!
Shortly after the campaign ends, our backers will get an email with a link to our Very Necessary Pledge Manager at BackerKit. Please be patient, it will take at least a week for us to get everything finalized. We will post an update here when our BackerKit page is live.
The BackerKit pledge manager will not stay open forever, so please try to fill it out as soon as possible. If, for any reason, you miss it, don't despair, you can contact us and we will do our best to get you your rewards.
We now have a central page on our web site where we keep track of all of our Kickstarter campaigns! We also have a contact form, in case you need to get in touch with us about an old campaign. We want to make sure everyone gets their rewards!
    Girl Genius is an ongoing story featuring adventure, romance, and Mad Science! It follows the adventures of Agatha Heterodyne, the last of a notorious family in which the spark of mad science runs strong. We call it a ""Gaslamp Fantasy,"" by which we mean that it takes place in an old-fashioned, Vernian world of airships, monsters, and wild inventions.
Girl Genius is published as a webcomic and graphic novel series, and also as a series of prose novels. The graphic series is updated three times a week on our web site at girlgeniusonline.com. When we have enough pages, roughly once a year, we run a Kickstarter campaign and publish a collection.
Queens and Pirates is Book Five of the Second Journey of Agatha Heterodyne–and the eighteenth book in the overall series. If you're new to the Girl Genius comics, The Second Journey is a great place to jump in!
We are Phil and Kaja Foglio, creators of the ongoing adventure story Girl Genius. We are ready to make the print version of Girl Genius: Queens and Pirates, the latest in our self-published series of Hugo award-winning graphic novels. The book will be printed as a trade paperback, with a short run of special hardcover volumes that feature a lovely ""puffy"" padded cover.
We used to offer pre-orders for upcoming books through our online store; which helped us pay for the up-front costs of printing the books. It also allowed us to get an idea of how many books we should be making in the first print run, especially of the limited-edition hardcover. Now we use Kickstarter, which really streamlines this process. We learn and get better at it every time we do a campaign. You can see information about all our previous campaigns on the Kickstarter Information page at girlgeniusonline.com.
If this campaign funds, all our backers will be asked to fill out our Very Necessary Pledge Manager form from BackerKit. A link to the pledge manager will be sent to each backer in an email from us through BackerKit, and we'll let everyone know when it has gone out. The pledge manager is important, because it's the only way we get a physical address to use when we mail your rewards.
The Book Cover!
As ever, we like to start with a tiny little immediate reward. Here is a special icon–just for fun. We hope you enjoy it, and use it to spread the word. We are very bad at social media, so any help we can get is appreciated!
The contents of the different reward levels are listed to the right. The stars of the show are, of course, the books. In addition, all backers getting a book will also receive a campaign-exclusive archival, acid free, self-adhesive 3""x4""bookplate, signed by authors Phil & Kaja Foglio.
Now that we have funded and met some stretch goals, each signed bookplate now comes in the Envelope of Madness! What is the ""Envelope of Madness?"" It's the stack of flat extras we'll be shipping along with each pledge level that contains a book. At this time, it consists of:
The signed bookplate
One Queens and Pirates sticker
One ""Thank You!"" art card featuring Bangladesh DuPree and Captain Hawkins
One Queens and Pirates bookmark
The 2019 Transylvania Polygnostic University Student ID (with handy checklist)
One Trilobite temporary tattoo
One ""You say COFFEE, I say BRAIN FUEL"" sticker
One ""SCIENCE!"" sticker
OTHER LEVELS AND REWARDS:
Because of stretch goals, BACKERS at the $10 and up level will also receive:
A link to DriveThruComics to download a free PDF copy of the book
A link to DriveThruComics to download a free PDF containing not just Revenge of the Weasel Queen, but our Girl Genius Cinderella story as well! 
PDFS: For those who either do not want a physical book or plan to get it from their favorite real-life book store (or library) later, yet still want to support the project, we have some lower-level rewards, starting with a simple ""Tips Jar."" All our backers, regardless of level, will receive access to our commemorative downloadable computer wallpaper, which we will reveal at the end of the campaign.
TRAVEL STICKERS: At a slightly higher level, we have a new set of FOUR travel stickers! This year's set will feature attractions from around Londinium: The Hall of Privateers, The Royal Museum of Inconvenient Oddities, and the Glass City itself. I know we say in the sidebar that it's a three sticker set, but we've added an extra sticker, because we can't contain our enthusiasm for that pinnacle of Londinium tourism: Hydraulic Pump No. 74.
Our 2019 Travel Stickers!

MEDALS: Next, we have this year's campaign-exclusive medal: this year it's for being a First Class Scallywag! It's a substantial metal pin-back affair, offered in a choice of silvery or brassy tones. Here is the sketch for this year's design!
Below are examples of some of our medals from previous campaigns. As you can see, the finals wind up a lot more 3D than Phil's 2D drawings...
PATCHES: Some levels also include our limited-edition Queens and Pirates patch. Here is the concept art:
The campaign has funded! Hooray! Now, we're able to set things up so that we can offer add-ons. So, if you're after extra medals, books or patches, you'll be able to add those on after the campaign, when our BackerKit survey goes out.
Now backer levels at and over the $12 level will have access to our post-campaign pledge management system! This is where you can add on all kinds of things, including extra campaign medals, patches and Envelopes of Madness. Additional shipping, if any becomes necessary, will be calculated in the pledge management system. (It has to do with weight and postal categories.)
Nota bene: We will have the BackerKit store open for a while after the campaign, but the campaign exclusives: the medals, patches and Envelopes of Madness, may be slightly more expensive at that point. So if you think you'll want one of our exclusives later, back now!
And now, onward to the stretch goals:
Just what it says...everyone at and above the $10 level will now get a free download link to the PDF of the book at Drivethrucomics.com, where the rest of our Girl Genius titles are half off throughout the campaign.
What is the ENVELOPE OF MADNESS? It's the stack of flat extras we'll be shipping along with each pledge level that contains a book. Now, the bookplate will be shipped inside the traditional ENVELOPE OF MADNESS, along with a Queens and Pirates sticker. Further stretch goals will add more to the envelope.
 Deluxe medals! At this level, each of our medals will come with an extra insert to make it even more magnificent! They’ll be part of the whole thing when it ships, but you can still easily take them apart and customize them with past medals and inserts.
  We've been out of our popular Trilobite lapel pins for AGES, now we'll be able to make more!
We just finished this art, and we'll be doing some other things with it, but stickers sound pretty good to start with!
It'll look sort of like this
For reasons of his own, Phil felt like making some beer labels. We'll print some up and offer them as an add-on in BackerKit!
A special PDF of the Revenge of the Weasel Queen side story for our $10 and up backers!
It'll be a sticker, with this artwork.

Finally, we also have a special downloadable wallpaper (in addition to the campaign exclusive wallpaper mentioned above.) This wallpaper is a freebie for all of you who have taken the time to come to our campaign page, whether or not you back the campaign. Thank you for visiting! There are five versions of the wallpaper, in the following sizes: 2560x1600, 1920x1080, 1600x1200, 1024x1024, 600x800. Or, you can download a zipped archive of all five.

Quick Synopsis
We embedded with amazing indigenous ultra-runners to bring you a cinematic expression of why we all love to run. We travelled to the highlands of Japan, the Kalahari Desert in Africa, the Navajo Nation in Arizona, the forests of Finland and the streets of NYC (the famed Self-Transcendence 3100 Mile Run)  to capture the esoteric, spiritual side of running. 
We shot the film in narrative (non-fiction) style and weave our stories together in such a natural way that we're sure this film will be unlike any sports documentary ever made.
We've completed all filming and need your help to finish editing the film, doing a sound mix, composing music and doing color correction.
Our Bushman character preparing for a hunt.
Overview
Like many runners, we were inspired by the 2009 book Born to Run. But we wanted to hear even more about the deepest spiritual traditions of exceptional indigenous runners from around the world. We wondered if we could, first of all, find runners that actually embodied the ancient esoteric approach to running and then earn their trust.
But first ... a 3100 Mile Race??
The most elusive, elite multi-day race in the world, the Self-Transcendence 3100 Mile Race, takes place in Queens, New York City each summer and demands at least 59 miles a day for 52 straight days.  
We followed Ashprihanal Aalto, a diminutive Finnish paperboy and a 13 time (!) finisher of this colossal race as he returned for a record 14th attempt. We also follow Shamita Achenbach-Konig, an Austrian cellist as she attempts the Race for the first time. 
While the participants of that Race are for the most part Western, the Race was founded by the Indian spiritual teacher Sri Chinmoy. In a sense, the Race requires runners to tap into an ancient energy found in the most remote cultures of the world. We build the arc of the entire film around this race and bounce between remote, expedition-worthy locations to draw parallels between the approaches to running.
The start of the 2016 3,100 Mile Race
Monks, Navajo & Bushmen - Oh My!
Cameras in hand, we set off on a global exploration of running. 
We hunted on the run with the Bushmen of Botswana. Hunting was recently banned by the Botswana Government as one step in their attempt to destroy this ancient culture. We met a group of Bushmen hunters defying that ban who wanted us to film their ancestral way of hunting.
We ran with champion Navajo runners versed by their Elders in the spiritual traditions of running. Shaun Martin, a Navajo educator, was attempting to retrace the footsteps of his father, who like many Native American kids was forced into government boarding school. Shaun's dad would routinely escape and walk the 100 miles back to his family's homesite. Shaun was attempting to do that distance in one shot.
And we embedded with the Japanese Marathon Monks to document their epic 1,000 day running journey where the stakes are literally life or death. Once a generation they pick an Aspirant to do 1000 days over 7 years, in 100 day chunks - up to 56 miles per day. If the Aspirant fails to complete his/her daily mileage requirement, he/she must commit suicide (!). Thankfully this hasn't happened in 100s of years.
Getting access was not easy by any means. But we approached with enough humility to win over folks, some of whom had never allowed outsiders to film their core spiritual traditions. And to our delight and surprise, the stories started to overlap in absolutely amazing ways.

  Risking Everything
Our characters and our team risked much (in some cases their very lives) to bring you this film. We’ve completed production and have started editing. We need your help to complete our edit and share the film with runners everywhere.
Will the film change the world? We don’t know. Will it change the viewers? Can’t say for sure. Has it changed us? Yes – it most certainly has. And that transformative experience we’ve had as filmmakers and runners is exactly what we want to bring to you. We’ve all run millions of steps in our lifetimes. We’re asking for your help in taking this next big step together.

566,1380675353,"Nightgaunts - A Lovecraftian short creature film
We're adapting of one of HP Lovecraft’s classic tales of terror into an surreal short film, combining live action with motion capture and stop motion animation.
 The Story
In the year 1920, a young writer is tormented nightly by apocalyptic visions of a strange ruined city, where the last remnants of humanity are hunted down by ravenous eldritch creatures! There is no place to hide, for the great Old Ones have returned, and they have reclaimed the world as their own.
The Origin of the Nightgaunts
When it comes to the work of writer H.P. Lovecraft's, the thing that most people remember are the creatures that he invented. Undying alien gods, and shapeshifiting horrors beyond man's feeble comprehension, like the great Cthulhu, Yog-Sothoth, and the Demon Sultan Azathoth.
But these were not the first creatures that Lovecraft saw in his imagination. For years when he was younger, Lovecraft writes that he was terrified by a vivid reoccurring nightmare. In these dreams, Lovecraft found himself trapped in a strange city, with bizarre angles and alien geometry. And then, swarming out of the darkness he would see them. A race of faceless flying creatures. Horned, black, and slender, with membranous bat-like wings. Every night he would run from these creatures, and every night they would chase him down. They would pull him screaming into the air in their talons, and carry him over a hellish world teeming with shapeless monstrosities. This early experience would leave a lasting impression Lovecraft in his work as a writer, with these terrifying images creeping into his work time and time again. After 30 years, he write down his nightmare, turning it into a short piece called 'Nightgaunts'.
PLAY

Adaptation
Creating any adaptation comes with challenges, but it is especially difficult when it comes to Lovecraft's writing. The power of his work isn't in the events that happen in the plot, but its in the way he describes things. The deeply unsettling mood that he manages to create. Cyclopic images and glimpses of cosmic cycles that utterly dwarf his characters and the reader, to create an overwhelming sensation of helplessness. The constant looming threat fearfully mentioned throughout the mythos he created is the inescapable prophecy that one day mankind will be cleared off the planet when the Old Ones awaken to reclaim the world as their own. 
In our film, we want to bring Lovecraft's apocalyptic vision to life. To show one dreamer's terrifying glimpse of a future world, where behemoth alien Gods tower over the destroyed cities of man. Where the last humans are reduced to hiding like our mammal ancestors during the Age of tyrant lizards. Hiding in the ruins, like insects under a stone, and fleeing from hungry swarms of Nightgaunts that pick off the last survivors.
We aim to capture this oppressive atmosphere through our use of surreal visuals and experimental film making techniques. For inspiration, we've been looking at German expressionist artwork and films of the 1920's. In particular we are drawn to the work FW Murnau, creator of Nosferatu (1922)  and Faust (1926). 
Nosferatu (1922) and Faust (1926)
We want to emulate his expert use of bold angle, dark shadows, and bold mythical poetic images. By combing live action, photomontage, and both 3d and stop motion animation together, we aim to create a film that feels like a lucid nightmare.
Here is an early test clip that we put together last month, show some of the techniques we will be experimenting with.
PLAY

The Creature Design
One of the main attractions of our project is the chance to bring some of Lovecraft's classic creatures to life in a new way.
Now the Nightgaunts have been around a long time. For nearly 90 years, sci fi illustrators have been drawing them, and for the most part they've come to have a fairly accepted standardized look. They are depicted as humanoid demons with bat wings on their back. 
  Original Nightgaunt illustration
But for our film, we want to reimagine them as if they were creatures that evolved on another world. Living alien organisms, with adaptations that help them survive in their environment. To stay true to the source material, there are key features that we needed keep: they are horned, slender, with a pitchfork tail, grasping claws, bat like wings, and have no face. Next we looked at nature for answers.
Nightgaunt animal references
For example, the creature that has no face but still need a way to eat prey. So like a star fish, we've imagined it has evolved a mouth in its chest, and can extend it's stomach directly onto prey. Then instead of a tail, we've given it a long forked tongue that extends out of the chest mouth to taste its surroundings. If it has no eyes, it must have developed a form of echolocation. So we've shaped the horns to act like bat's ears, to channel sound into the giant ear drum that takes up the Nightgaunt's entire face.

PLAY

Motion Capture
Like in our last film, 'The Jovian Project', we are excited to again be using Motion Capture technology in part to help bring the film’s creatures to life. Although working with Mocap may have a complicated pipeline, it has huge advantages for us as performers and storytellers. There is so much that is gained from having a human physically perform on a set. It allows us the chance to become the creatures, and to make discoveries we never would have thought of if we were just sitting behind a computer. Using stilts, our mocap performers are forced to rethink how to move and interact with their environment with pteranodon like elongated arms and folded wings. We also get to explore the behavior of a blind creature. We've done shots where the actors are blind folded or have closed eyes, forcing them to navigate by the sound and by touch. In the end, we hope to create creatures that are believable as real animals, not just monsters. 
PLAY

  PLAY

Stop Motion 
Kat Ruiz, Stop Motion Animator
While our team embraces new technology, we are also very passionate about keeping classical styles of animation alive, such as stop motion. As animators, the work of legend Ray Harryhausen remains one of our biggest inspirations. No matter how good the computer rendering is, sometimes there is no way to replace the real thing. So for our film, we want to pay homage to the classics and find creative ways to incorporate stop motion into creating our environments and the Creatures FX. Such as in bringing to life the writhing lakes of shape-shifting Shoggoths. The downside is that using stop motion is largely more expensive and time consuming for our production than it would to be to use 3D Animation. Therefore the extent to which we will be able to use Stopmotion in our film will have to be determined primarily by the amount of backing our project receives.
About us
For the core members of our team, this will be our second film project together. Our first animated short film 'The Jovian Project', loosely based on the short story 'From Beyond', was an homage to the classic B movies of the atomic age and the horror movies of Vincent Price. Our film has met with success in festivals around the world, winning the Berlin Scifi Film Festival's award for Best Animation.

Given our the strong reception we've received from science fiction and horror fans out there, we've decided to rejoin forces to bring you an even more ambitious film project!
Cast:
Evan Hall - The Dreamer
In our surreal film, Evan Hall will be playing the leading role as the Dreamer, a young writer whose reoccurring apocalyptic nightmares have pushed him verge of nervous breakdown. This character is inspired by H.P. Lovecraft's own descriptions of himself in his youth, and Lovecraft's reoccurring fictional character Randolph Carter.  
At Victoria School of the Performing Arts, Evan received the Dean Storie Award for his work in Physical Theatre. This inspiration led him to Vancouver's Seacoast Studio, led by Canadian theatre alumnis Scott Swan to learn Naturalistic, Shakespearian, and Film & Television Acting. He has since performed in at least 100 different Film Productions. He has also performed throughout BC with Seacoast's long-running show, Fractured, an ensemble play about the growing consistency of school shootings in North America, where he received the Greater Vancouver Zone Theatre Festival's award for Best Supporting Actor. 
Evan and Noah have worked together on Noah Van Buhren's award-winning production ""The Jovian Project"" where they both used motion capture. This time Evan is on the other side of the coin, working on camera against the mo-cap characters, and is enjoying the new challenge.

Budget
To complete the film by early this summer, we need to raise a minimum of $2,500 to make this movie.  This money will be used to support the animation team, as well as going towards covering the expenses of filming the live action content including: practical gore FX, gear rental, insurance, props, craft services, etc.  
Nightgaunts Budget
That's really just a skeleton budget though, so we've created stretch goals to put some flesh on it. All additional money raised will support costs such as additional visual effects such as stop motion animtaion, better practical effects and set building.
Stretch Goal #1: $5 000
In our film, we want to create a nightmarish landscape teeming with the eldritch Gods and monsters from Lovecraft's mythos. The more resources we we receive, the more creatures we can bring to life using both 3D and classic stop motion animation.
Stretch Goal # 2: $10,000
Ia Ia! Help us reach this goal, and we shall attempt the insane, the unthinkable! We will attempt to raise our master, the Great CTHULHU Himself from His sunken prison beneath the sea!
We will also be able to spend More on Practical Effects! More on Makeup and Prosthetics! More on Set building! And More Locations, to bring this thing to life! 
In addition to this, we know that our Cast and Crew deserve to be rewarded for the time and effort they've put into this passion project. The more support you give us, the more we will be able to make sure that all of our Team and additional volunteers, not just the film's director, are able to financially benefit from their hard work and dedication.

What is The Re-Taken?
In the spirit of Insidious, The Conjuring and The Exorcist, The Re-taken is an intense American female driven supernatural horror film inspired by actual events.  Women are heroes and a mother's love is a mighty force to be reckoned with in this world and in the supernatural world as well.   The story was written by California attorney, turned writer-producer, Adina Turman and features a talented multi-cultural, multi-racial cast. 
The Story 
A gifted psychic mother and grandmother, a master of astral projection is a retiring demon hunter.  She and her identical twin sister, also a psychic, are forced to use their individual supernatural talents and all the risk that comes with them, to save her daughter from an ultimate demon possession from a long ago threat.  The problem they face is that once your soul has been taken, can it be re-taken?

 Producer's Philosophy: 
 Admittedly, The Retaken is a small film by Hollywood standards.  Since our budget is small, our thinking has to be smart!  We can't rely on numerous CGI effects, if any.  Our film tells a story about characters that you will care about,fighting against insurmountable odds and desperate situations. This is what makes the film worth making and watching. 
If we raise more than we expect, then of course, we will build sets and use more special effects, this part is up to you!  We will do our best with the project as funded.  This is our promise.

568,2110354753,"Rebecca Bathory in an Abandoned School 2012
Rebecca Bathory is a fine art photographer from London. Finding beauty in darkness, poetry and meaning in the forgotten and surreal imaginary worlds amongst decay. Rebecca's artworks breathe life into forgotten historical locations, reawaken old narratives, find beauty and meaning in ruin and revive the memories of lost moments in forgotten places.
  Elegant Decay
    The Manor
    The Orphans of Time series consists of 5 years of photographing abandoned buildings
The photography series Orphans of Time started in 2012, when Rebecca stepped into an abandoned school and fell in love with the beauty to be found in decay, her previous love of fashion photography became replaced by a love of capturing images of these buildings. Orphans of Time is a collection of images from over 500 abandoned locations visited during the last five years.
Decadent Decay
Unseen by the ordinary public who pass blindly by their boarded windows and fenced walls, ""No Trespass"" signs restrain communities from seeing the hidden world within, slowly being claimed back by nature. Rebecca finds entry to these mystical, hidden places and sensitively captures a beautiful record of them, as they deserve to be recorded for posterity, before they are lost as time rolls inexorably on. 
She captures their stories and character through carefully composed images, revealing the romance and memories of the ruins. In reality these places will cease to exist very soon and as  memories fade, they will be forgotten and although derelict places have no appeal as tourist destinations, their value and place in cultural memory is fundamental to the history of the 20th century. 
The Beauty Within
These majestic places are crumbling with time and one day will disappear entirely from view and living memory. But, there is no difference between iconic world sites, which attract tourism and the abandoned places known to so few. Hidden from the narrative of history, these places are imbued with a wealth of meaning, a history of their own, which deserves to be recorded for posterity too. It is absolutely vital to sensitively preserve this rich history before it is gone forever.
Melancholia
  Doorway to a New Realm
  Orphans of Time, the book, is a 240 page, limited edition of 2000 featuring the award winning series of photographs of abandoned buildings by British fine art photographer Rebecca Lilith Bathory. Rebecca travelled around the world for five years, from 2012 to 2017, seeking out the most beautiful, decaying locations. The book features approximately 200 full colour photos from the images she obtained.
Rebecca has chosen to self publish this series as it holds a very special part of her heart, from years of adventures in decaying buildings, she has selected her favourite and the most popular images from the series to produce this Victorian inspired book. As if it has been found decaying in the very buildings she has taken the photos within the pages.

Cover Image of 'Coffee Table Photo Binder' (with the inclusion of 25 'Black and White' Complimentary M&B Images to assist in initiating a Personalized Vintage Photography Collection).
'A Young Man's Life Prayer' Original Limited-Edition (11"" x 14"" Print)
Imagine not being able to hold on to those memories or perhaps refer to those memories captured via still images.  These images depict meanings in life that portray certain feelings of love, relaxation and a respectful view of what life is really about. Each and every photo placed in this book (and displayed via the website) defines its own characteristic as it challenges the viewer to read into the messages conveyed.
My main purpose in reaching out to the Kickstarter Community is for assistance in raising enough money to provide those special people in my life (as well as those who make generous donations) a rare customized vintage photo frame book (binder) that entails a compilation of imagery that has derived from years of photographing and capturing the innocence of unconditional love.  My grandmother, who has always thought highly of me and the success of my work, has taken ill since the death of my grandfather and I feel that her having this tangible book at her disposal could be the answer in giving her that extra motivation to live another day, due to her strong faith in me and my dream of becoming a photographer.  She does not have a computer to access my work on-line (as I strictly use on-line services for purposes of marketing), so the main idea behind this project (aside from primarily enhancing and promoting the photography business itself) is to significantly enlighten her heart by taking all of the on-line images via my website and creating a unique Avery-style 'Lasher Antiqued Victorian' Photo Book that is specifically made for her.  This photo binder includes 2"" Capacity 1 Touch EZ-Turn™ 3-Ring Gaps (black) used to prevent gapping and misalignment. The book itself significantly portrays each image via an eye-catching 8.5"" x 11"" customized signature full-bleed, photo-quality printing on the front, back and the 2.8"" spine. This photo book binder includes 500 pages, created to display professional quality satin photo prints developed specifically for darkroom printing.  Kodak photographic paper is a premium silver-halide paper designed to dramatically enhance colors while maintaining consistent tonal reproduction per a hardbound cover. The backer in receipt of this professionally made book binder copy (based on specific 'Reward Option') will have the opportunity of displaying the received 5.00"" x 7.00"" Kodak photo prints (25 total) for display purposes as well as room to customize the binder product based on personal preferences. This allows the backer the option of displaying additional personal family photos while also accompanying the provided vintage imagery. Coincidentally, due to the current pixelation of specific site images, many of the photos are not resizeable past the previously presented size (5.00""x7.00"") in order to avoid blurry or pixelated images when the product is produced.  However, this allows for an array of sizes to be added to photo binder as backer deems appropriate.  
I have been a freelance 'vintage' stock photographer for 10 years and have been marketing this decade long dream of mine while also trying to promote myself as such via an on-line website business.  During the course of these 10 years, I have developed that website displaying my works of art (viewable at http://memoriesandbeyond.com/) and have also taken pleasure in allowing family, friends and of course the general public to delight themselves in these innocent 'times gone by'. Coincidentally, there comes a point when the business itself must become and remain virtually and technologically updated to create that user-friendly aspect, allowing consumers to enjoy even more the purpose behind the product.  I had considered (on several occasions) selling the business to someone who could carry it to its highest potential but have since reconsidered, looking to enhance the 'Memories and Beyond' Photography business on my own.   
How will the funds be spent? - I am striving to distribute the book in bulk fashion so as to provide copies for not only my grandmother but for additional family members, close friends, fellow stock photographers and of course the general public in order to help further market my personal collection of vintage photography.  The funding obtained via Kickstarter will definitely allow for additional marketing options in helping to promote a more global market and user-friendly website for purposes of personal browsing, choosing and ordering the consumer's desired images.  The website is in need of updated web design (which is currently in progress) and due to the current updating, no orders are being accepted at this time via the M&B on-line store.  This will allow time for a more detailed business plan and marketing approach.  However, once the 'Memories and Beyond' Stock Photography business is in full force, I hope to receive a huge supply of orders.  The original hardbound coffee table photo book binder will also be placed on the website as an additional future purchase item upon completion of updated web design, priced to provide a complete arrangement of on-line images (time frame of completion is yet to be determined). Coincidentally, backers via this campaign are also helping to launch a brand new limited-edition product.
Again, there are definitely costs associated with black and white film and print developing so I hope that this project is successful in its desired outcome.  Should there be any questions regarding the campaign in general (or questions regarding additional images of interest via the website that are non-related to campaign), please do not hesitate to ask. Once 'Memories and Beyond' becomes a productive on-line photography business, all images via site will be made available for purchase. "

THE NEW CD & BOOK
We’re really excited to be creating the Naghash Ensemble’s new CD and Book “Songs of Exile - Volume II” and we want you to be part of it!
Origins of The Naghash Ensemble
The idea for The Naghash Ensemble came to me when I was living in Armenia. I was exploring the ancient temple of Garni, which is in the middle of nowhere, when suddenly I heard the most amazing sound. Inside the temple, five women were singing medieval Armenian spiritual music and I was mesmerized. I kept hearing this sound in my mind for days afterwards, but as a composer it started taking on new shapes. Soon it was all I was thinking about and the voices in my head were now accompanied by a variety of Armenian instruments (dhol, duduk, and oud) as well as piano and string quartet. The sound of this new music I was creating was perfectly clear to me. The problem was, there wasn’t a single ensemble in the world that combined five female soloists, duduk, oud, dhol, piano and string quartet so...
I had to start my own.
In 2011 I formed The Naghash Ensemble with some of the best singers and musicians in Armenia.
Hasmik Baghdasaryan - Soprano  
Tatevik Movsesyan - Soprano 
Arpine Ter-Petrosyan - Alto   
Emmanuel Hovhannisyan - Duduk  
Aram Nikoghosyan - Oud
Tigran Hovhannisyan - Dhol/Dumbek
John Hodian - Composer/Piano
Discovering the Texts
I began to search for texts that would fit this new mystic, rhythmic, ecstatic sound in my head. I spent several years researching in the libraries of New York, Berlin and Yerevan. I finally came across a small fragment of text by the little known medieval Armenian poet and priest, M’krtich Naghash. Naghash's words leapt off the page into my soul and I knew I had found my text. 
“We are all exiles brother. No one has a homeland. We are bound together, the afterlife is our homeland.” –– M’krtich Naghash
All Naghash left behind were a handful of paintings and 16 poems. After some time deliberating which poems to use I became determined to set them all to music. “Songs of Exile - Volume II” will be the second group of recordings of what will eventually be a three volume set.
These poems are profound meditations on the vagaries of living a life in exile. Though Naghash was a highly regarded priest and poet in the 15th century, he ran afoul of the local authorities and was forced to leave his church, friends and family and become a “gharib” (exile). 
This concept of living a life in exile is very important to many Armenians. As a descendent of Armenian Genocide survivors, I have always been aware of the atrocities at the beginning of the 20th century in the Ottoman Empire. More than 1.5 million Armenians were either exterminated or sent on death marches. The few who survived, were eventually scattered around the globe. 
While written hundreds of years ago, Naghash’s words are, sadly, just as relevant today in light of what is happening to people in Syria and many other parts of the world. 
If you have never heard The Naghash Ensemble live, here is a short clip from a recent concert in Frankfurt Germany:
New Trees From Ancient Roots
I’ve been setting Naghash’s poems to music for the past five years, but in many ways I have been preparing for this work all of my life.
The music is part classical (it included a fully notated string quartet) and Armenian sounding (I’m Armenian and that is most of what I heard growing up) but also influenced by my years as a jazz musician, film composer, and improviser.
I have always been interested in art which has its roots in Armenian culture but reinterprets, redefines and re-imagines that culture. 
Working with some of the best musicians in Armenia, I’m constantly inspired by their fearless approach to this new music and what they bring to it. I think we have created something wholly unique and I am very excited about sharing it with the rest of the world. 
The First Recording (and a book!)
The first recording took several years to make and was accompanied by a beautiful book with extensive photos, information on Naghash, reproductions of his paintings, and the birth of the ensemble. The book, including the poems, was translated into English, German, French and Armenian. The recording sold out on our first tour but we have just reprinted it and it is now available here. 
In 2012 The Naghash Ensemble released ""Songs of Exile - Volume I""
Our 2nd recording and a huge leap forward!
We are really excited about the new music we are recording for the 2nd volume of ""Songs of Exile”. The first volume was very melodic and focused almost exclusively on the singers. This new collection of pieces is much more energetic, rhythmic and even funky at times. Plus the new pieces allow the players in the ensemble to stretch out. Here is a short sample of one of the new pieces:
OUR KICKSTARTER
It’s not easy being a musician who works outside of popular music. Thankfully The Naghash Ensemble has found an audience and I’m grateful we live in a time where we can reach thousands of people on-line.
This work lives because of people like you!
Recording, mixing, printing books, etc. are all very expensive and while we make money from touring and CD sales, it is not nearly enough to sustain the creation of new work at a high level.
In order to continue this work we need your help and we are asking for $15,000 to cover the cost of recording the ensemble and creating the 2nd beautiful CD and book. We are part way through the recording process and now we need your help to continue!
Please make a pledge!
EVERY CONTRIBUTION HELPS!
This type of crowdfunding only succeeds if many people become involved. If you want to support this work tell your friends. Share the music! Send them the link to our kickstarter. Post it on facebook, tweet about it! Or even send a letter! The more people who hear about it the better. We believe this music is worth it.

Wir haben's geschafft! Dank der Hilfe unserer großartigen Unterstützer haben wir unser Ziel erreicht: 15.000 USD! 
Die neue CD des Naghash Ensembles „Songs of Exile - Volume II“ und sein wunderschönes Begleitbuch werden Wirklichkeit! 
Danke!
Und jetzt … haben wir neue Ziele 
Schon seit Langem wollten wir der Jerewaner Musikszene etwas zurückgeben – denn sie war es, die die Entstehung des Naghash Ensembles erst ermöglicht hat. Deshalb freuen wir uns sehr, unser neues Ziel zu verkünden: 
1. Ein kostenloses Konzert in der Jerewaner Oper 
Wenn wir unser neues Ziel von 18.500 USD erreichen, veranstalten wir ein kostenloses Konzert in Jerewans größtem Konzertsaal: der Jerewaner Oper. Das Konzert wird im Herbst 2016 stattfinden – mit freiem Eintritt für Kinder wie Erwachsene! Die Jerewaner Oper ist ein wunderschöner Veranstaltungsort und mit diesem Konzert werden wir feiern, was wir mit unserer Kickstarter-Kampagne erreicht haben. 
2. Kamera, Licht – und Action!
Wenn wir unser Ziel von 23.000 USD erreichen, bringen wir dieses Konzert via Live-Stream in Dein Wohnzimmer! Wir sprechen von High-End-Aufnahmen, fünf professionellen Kameramännern, Steadycams, Sound-Mixing, Licht und allem drum und dran. Die Aufnahmen von diesem Konzert werden großartiges Material für unsere zukünftigen PR-Videos sein. Dieser Live-Stream zeigt das Naghash Ensemble von seiner allerbesten Seite! 
3. Als DVD …
Wenn wir unser Ziel von 25.000 USD erreichen, produzieren wir eine Live-DVD des Naghash Ensembles in der Jerewaner Oper. Dafür brauchen wir zusätzlich professionellen Schnitt und Tonmischung. Diese DVD wird unser Dankeschön an alle, die unsere Kickstarter-Kampagne mit mindestens 100 USD unterstützen.

„Drei großartige Sängerinnen und einige der besten Instrumentalisten Armeniens an Duduk, Oud und Dhol verbinden die Spiritualität armenischer Folksongs mit zeitgenössischem Postminimalismus und unbändiger Jazz-Energie.""
 Armenisch-Deutsche Korrespondenz
„Eine Musik, von der man kaum sagen kann, ob sie alt oder neu klingt, fremd oder vertraut, westlich oder östlich, schlicht oder komplex, minimalistisch oder mittelalterlich.“ 
BR Klassik
Die „Songs of Exile, Volume II“ als Buch und CD – mit Deiner Hilfe werden sie Wirklichkeit!
Die Geschichte des Naghash Ensembles
Die Idee für das Naghash Ensemble kam mir, als ich in Armenien lebte. Ich erkundete den uralten Tempel Garni, als ich plötzlich wunderschöne Klänge vernahm. Im Inneren des Tempels sangen fünf Frauen mittelalterliche armenische Kirchenmusik. Ich war wie hypnotisiert. Noch Tage später hallte diese Musik in meinen Gedanken nach und mit der Zeit begann sie, neue Formen anzunehmen. Zu den Frauenstimmen fügten sich die armenischen Instrumente Oud, Duduk und Dhol, außerdem ein Flügel und ein Streichquartett. Bald hatte ich eine genaue Vorstellung von der Musik, die ich komponieren wollte. Aber es gab ein Problem: Kein einziges Ensemble auf der Welt vereinte fünf Frauenstimmen, Duduk, Oud, Dhol, Flügel und Streichquartett. Also gründete ich mein eigenes.
2011 gewann ich einige der besten Sängerinnen und Instrumentalisten Armeniens für das Naghash Ensemble.
Hasmik Baghdasaryan - Sopran 
Tatevik Movsesyan - Sopran
Arpine Ter-Petrosyan - Alt 
Emmanuel Hovhannisyan - Duduk
Aram Nikoghosyan - Oud Tigran Hovhannisyan - Dhol/Dumbek
John Hodian - Komponist/Flügel
Die Entdeckung der Texte
Ich begab mich auf die Suche nach Texten, die zu der mystischen, rhythmischen Musik in meinem Kopf passen würden. Mehrere Jahre lang durchsuchte ich in Bibliotheken New Yorks, Berlins und Jerewans. Schließlich stieß ich auf ein Gedichtfragment des wenig bekannten mittelalterlichen armenischen Priesters und Dichters Mkrtich Naghash. Seine Worte sprangen von Buchseite direkt in meine Seele und ich wusste, dass ich meinen Text gefunden hatte.
„Wir alle sind Fremde, o Brüder, niemand hat Heimat.
 Wir alle müssen gehen, allein das Jenseits ist uns Heimat.“
 Mkrtich Naghash
Naghashs Nachlass war schmal: 16 Gedichte und eine Handvoll Malereien. Seine Gedichte sind ergreifende Meditationen über das Dasein in der Fremde und die Beziehung des Menschen zu Gott. Obwohl Naghash als Priester und Dichter seinerzeit hoch geachtet war, geriet er mit der lokalen Verwaltung in Konflikt und war gezwungen, seine Kirche, Freunde und Familie zu verlassen und ein Gharib (Wanderer, Fremder) zu werden.
Leben im Exil
Für viele Armenier ist dieses Konzept vom Dasein in der Fremde noch heute von großer Bedeutung. Als Enkelsohn von Überlebenden des armenischen Genozids erfuhr ich früh, was sich Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts im osmanischen Reich ereignet hatte: Mehr als 1,5 Millionen Armenier waren ermordet oder auf Todesmärsche geschickt worden und die wenigen Überlebenden suchten Zuflucht im Exil.
Angesichts dessen, was derzeit in Syrien und vielen anderen Regionen der Welt geschieht, ist es bemerkenswert, wie relevant Naghashs Gedichte auch heute noch sind.
Nachdem ich eine Weile versucht hatte, herauszufinden, mit welchen Gedichten ich arbeiten wollte, entschied ich mich schließlich, sie alle zu vertonen. „Songs of Exile, Volume II“ wird nun die zweite von drei geplanten CDs.
Hier einige Ausschnitte unseres Konzertes in Frankfurt im Frühling 2015:
Die Musik
Ich habe die letzten fünf Jahre damit verbracht, Naghashs Gedichte zu vertonen – aber gewissermaßen habe ich mich mein ganzes Leben darauf vorbereitet.
Die Musik des Naghash Ensembles ist klassisch (sie umfasst ein Streichquartett und ist vollständig notiert), klingt armenisch (ich bin Armenier und war als Kind ständig von armenischer Musik umgeben) und ist zugleich von meinen Jahren als Jazzmusiker, Filmkomponist und Improvisateur geprägt.
Ich habe mich seit jeher für Kunst interessiert, die in der armenischen Kultur wurzelt, diese dann aber neu interpretiert, neu definiert und neu erfindet.
Das Naghash Ensemble versammelt einige der besten Sängerinnen und Musiker Armeniens. Es begeistert und inspiriert mich immer wieder, wie furchtlos sie sich auch der schwierigsten und ungewöhnlichsten Passagen annehmen und wie sie durch ihre Verzierungen die „Songs of Exile“ prägen. Ich glaube, wir haben etwas ganz Außergewöhnliches geschaffen und ich freue mich, dass unsere neue CD in wenigsten Monaten ihren Weg in die Welt finden wird.
Die ersten Aufnahmen (und das erste Buch!)
Wir brauchten mehrere Jahre, um die „Songs of Exile, Volume I“ aufzunehmen. Die CD hatte ein ungewöhnliches, umfassendes Begleitbuch mit Fotos, Malereien, Informationen über Naghash und die Geschichte des Ensembles. Das Buch samt Naghashs Gedichten war viersprachig: Deutsch, Englisch, Französisch und Armenisch. Die erste Auflage war nach unserer Europa-Tour ausverkauft, die zweite Auflage ist jetzt wieder im Shop verfügbar.
2012 veröffentlichte das Naghash Ensemble „Songs of Exile, Volume I“
Die neuen Aufnahmen und ein riesiger Sprung nach vorn
Wir sind zutiefst begeistert von der neuen Musik, die wir für „Songs of Exile, Volume II“ aufnehmen. Volume I war sehr melodisch und hatte seinen Schwerpunkt fast ausschließlich auf den Sängerinnen. Die neuen Stücke sind stärker energiegeladen, rhythmischer, manchmal nahezu funkig. Außerdem eröffnen sie neue Räume für die Instrumentalisten.
Hier ein Ausschnitt eines meiner neuen Lieblingsstücke:
Unser Kickstarter
Es ist nicht leicht, sich als Musiker auf Pfade jenseits der Popmusik zu begeben. Ich bin froh, dass das Naghash Ensemble sein Publikum gefunden hat und dass wir in Zeiten leben, da wir über das Internet noch Tausende mehr erreichen können.
Dass die „Songs of Exile, Volume II“ bald auf wunderschönen CDs in kunstvollen Begleitbüchern erscheinen werden, verdanken wir Menschen wie dir!
Die Studioaufnahmen, das Mischen, das Drucken der Bücher und Pressen der CDs kostet viel Geld. Unser Einnahmen aus den Touren und CD-Verkäufen reichen nicht aus, um die „Songs of Exile, Volume II“ auf dem Niveau aufzunehmen und zu produzieren, wie sie es verdienen.
Deshalb brauchen wir Deine Hilfe. Wir benötigen 15.000 USD (knapp 13.800 Euro), um die Aufnahmen und die Produktion der zweiten wunderschönen CD mit Begleitbuch zu finanzieren. Wir sind mittendrin: Die ersten Songs sind aufgenommen und gemischt. Um die neusten Kompositionen aufzunehmen, wollen wir zurück ins Studio.
Unterstütze das Naghash Ensemble jetzt. Hilf uns, die „Songs of Exile, Volume II“ Wirklichkeit werden zu lassen!
Crowdfunding gelingt nur, wenn möglichst viele Menschen davon erfahren. Jeder Beitrag hilft! Und: Weitersagen hilft auch. Wenn Dir das Naghash Ensemble gefällt, erzähl Deinen Freunden davon. Spiel ihnen die „Songs of Exile“ vor. Schick ihnen einen Link zu unserer Kickstarterkampagne. Poste es auf Facebook, twittere darüber. Je mehr Leute davon hören, desto besser. Denn: Wir finden, diese Musik ist es wert!

574,1440482856,"In Storytelling, there is a common thread of events that happen in almost every story known to man. This has become known as ""The Hero's Journey"". Something about it is innate to Human Beings across all generations. The story always starts off in ""The Ordinary World"", and the Hero has to have a ""Call to Adventure"" to ""The Special World"".
 There are certain events that take place that the hero goes through to come back home a new person. These Story telling templates are no different from what goes on in real life when a person has to go to the special world to return home with ""The Elixir"". My travels over the past year as of June 2016 have led me to a very new and interesting road. I did not know that it would lead to where I am now. I am actually excited I have a platform in which to tell this story that has been developing in my life for this past year. 
 So, The Journey started in June of 2016. I booked a plane ticket to Cartagena, Colombia because I wanted to experience something new and exciting and I thought it would be a good place to play my music and make some money while doing this. Now mind you, We are talking about COLOMBIA! The country where everyone speaks Spanish. I did NOT know spanish before doing this. 
I was completely diving in head first (As I tend to do a lot these days!!). I had planned my trip for one month. And I thought that I would be in Cartagena the whole time. I had made a friend at my Spanish school literally a short walk from the beach. We became good friends on this trip, He was from London. I then met another guy who was staying at the same Hostel as me. He made a very serious and interesting comment. He told me ""You have to see Medellin"". And I felt like he really meant that for whatever reason. I brushed it off though because I was planning to be on the beach for a month straight while doing music gigs on the beach. The whole thing was planned out lol... So as time went by I started having fun in Cartagena and I met some very talented and cool musicians there. Now my friend from London Two Weeks in was leaving to go to Medellin. I honestly wanted to go too because of what the guy from the Hostel told me. So I went. I re-booked my ticket to From Medellin to Austin and I was on my way.  
I now know why that Man told me I NEED to see Medellin. Did I mention that the fruit that just grows so abundantly in this city is super fresh and amazing to the taste? Well if I didn't, now you know. Meanwhile I felt actually that on top of the amazing climate and fresh food that this city was actually a better place to gig at. I was on the beach before so everything was a little too relaxed and venues were slower with getting your gigs together. Medellin is a Metro City, so Me being from Austin, TX (The Live Music Capital of The World!) I can work my way around and get some nice gigs and make some good money. I did just that and I met some of the most humble talented people I've ever run across. Not only were the musicians talented they were classy people who showed me that no matter where you are in the world you can meet true friends.  
This part of my journey was my very first encounter with the music and Culture of Colombia. I returned in the beginning of January to escape all of the madness here in America and to play my music to people who wanted to listen. This trip I knew what I was doing, I knew where I was going and even better I had friends in the city. This time I stayed a whole one month in Medellin, Colombia. And let me tell you, It was one of the most rewarding things I have ever done. The amount of love I felt from God for giving me the opportunity to do such a thing, Traveling to another country to play my music that I made up in my apartment. This is life to me.  
I did the same thing in May of 2017 and stayed there for two weeks touring Medellin and surrounding cities. Because at this point people had started buying my music from me and asking me to perform at their venues.  
So now I am in Austin, Texas. I get a call from my friend in Colombia and he tells me that he wants to make an album with me combining my Hip-Hop culture with his Colombian Musical Culture. We had been gigging a lot together whenever I was in town and at this point for him to ask me that was like the only logical step that could happen next. That's where you come in, I can make this trip possible and continue this journey that I am currently on. I am a Musician. I create my music honestly and no one controls or censors my output. I have started making a living off of my Music. Do you know how good that feels? For me to eat a meal and pay rent because of my music is like the most satisfying thing in the world to me. I know with the completion of this album and documentary I can make this my launch pad for reaching my audience across the entire world. I have gotten this far by taking risks. I didn't just dream about it. I did something about it. I hope that my story can inspire anyone who has stumbled upon it. And if you did support my dreams and my music, Just know you have a very special place in my heart and soul.  
God Bless,
 Damon Scott Miller, Jr.
**P.S. OUTLINE OF MY BUDGET FOR THIS TRIP!!**
The money will go to:  
-Accomadation for 1 month in an apartment in the city of Medellin (Air Bnb): $1500  
-Food and Eating expenses: $350  
-Studio time from professionals in Medellin: $2500  
-Music Video costs from same film crew as the documentary makers (Estimated two to three videos for the songs : $1500  
-Documentary Makers (really just like two guys, but they are top notch videographers and really cool friends.): $1000  
-Direct payments to my sound engineers and producers (Again two guys who are my friends in the music industry in Colombia)-$2000  
-The flights to Medellin are very cheap compared to most places you fly internationally. I will be traveling with my Wife, two round trip tickets range from about $600 for flights with 17 hour layovers to $1100. In total that is $10,000. Having had the experience of traveling to Colombia before and having professional Musicians and sound engineers as my friends. This is a very calculated project. We are in very close contacts with each other and our ambitions on this project are monumental. We all come from different places in the world so it's going to be a unique experience."
575,943922760,"In the past twelve months, I have been on a remarkable journey with four people for whom travelling to Switzerland for a voluntary assisted death has brought about impossibly difficult situations. Three of my brave and bold friends are still with us, however my co-producer and I were in Switzerland with Marie, who passed peacefully, and with dignity, on Monday 4th September.
This documentary is now complete, although we need funds to get it on the international festival circuit and have it subtitled into French, German and Spanish, so as to maximise it's broadcast potential. 
Death is the inevitable end to life, and we should be supported to have what we consider to be a ‘good death’ whenever possible. But how do we, and who should be allowed to define a ‘good death’?
Recent landmark cases have highlighted the issues surrounding assisted suicide and may be shifting public opinion in the direction of greater freedom. However, this remains one of the most challenging and controversial debates of our time.
With participation, analysis and comment from all sides of the debate; the medical community, legal experts, people who are left incurably suffering and wish to slip painlessly away, and those who vehemently oppose any legislative change, my documentary investigates this high profile argument, in an in-depth and explorative way, from an ethical, medical, legal, cultural and personal perspective. The aim of the film is to provide information as well as to encourage social and political discourse in the UK about assisted suicide by showing perspectives of the people it actually concerns.
Participants include:- Colin Campbell, Alex Pandolfo, Omid T, Marie Lopez Ramos, Phil Cheatle, Dr Michael Irwin, Penny Hall, Saimo Chahal QC, Dr Erika Preisig, Lauren Nicklinson, Dr Richard Huxtable, Revd Canon Rosie Harper, Revd Graham Sykes and the Rt Revd Dr Lee Rayfield.
As a filmmaker, I've been involved in many a controversial subject matter, and I believe the law on assisted dying in the UK is cruel and unjust. My film includes participation, analysis and comment from all sides of the debate; the medical community, legal experts, people who are left incurably suffering and wish to slip painlessly away, and those who vehemently oppose any legislative change.
I am most grateful to Colin, Alex, Omid and Marie for allowing me to follow them on their individual journeys, and to all those who have participated, assisted and supported me to date, I cannot thank you enough.
If you have a personal, political or otherwise impassioned reason to see this film broadcast, please help us by making a donation. It is much appreciated. 
Andi Reiss (writer, producer, director)
Omid’s Story:
In his mid fifties, Iranian-born Omid is seeking the right to a medically assisted death. Multiple system atrophy is an incurable but non-terminal disease of the nervous system, and its left him hardly able to move or speak, and he’s in constant pain. But, whilst this means his quality of life is seriously degraded, Omid may have some years left to live. Medically speaking, he is not ‘ terminally ill’. If successful, Omid’s legal challenge could help to make assisted dying legal for anyone with an incurable disease, even if it is not terminal, so long as they are of sound mind, although legal challenges like this in our society are not easy, and there have been a number of high-profile cases recently that have failed in the UK.
Colin’s Story:
With a rare form of multiple sclerosis, Colin had spent much of the winter last year in hospital, but had been advised there was little treatment available. In the spring, having had to move back to his first floor apartment, Colin had decided to travel to Switzerland, anticipating another winter would be intolerable. Having met with Dr Erika Preisig at the Lifecircle organisation in Basle, he had been given a date for his assisted voluntary death, and he’d asked me to accompany him, not only to film, but to be his official witness.
Alex’s Story:
Alex is experiencing the early stages of Alzheimer’s. However, like Marie, Colin and Omid, Alex is not deemed terminally ill. A retired academic, university lecturer and wholly non-accidental agitator, Alex campaigns for autonomy, dignity and respect. Dementia and Alzheimer’s disease has replaced heart disease as the leading cause of death in the UK, and for Alex, choosing when to die is an incontrovertible human right. However, he is afraid he’ll lose his mental competence, or mental capacity before being able to take advantage of Assisted Voluntary Death at Lifecircle in Basle.
Marie’s Story:
At the age of 13 Marie was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease, a crippling and incurable condition that attacks the digestive system. Now 54, although not medically defined as terminally ill, she had endured 49 operations, was in constant pain and had to visit the bathroom up to 30 times a day. She had had enough. Although having being born in Spain and educated in Switzerland, Marie had a successful career as a city analyst in London, and had lived in Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire for over 15 years. However, in 2008 she had to give up work, and although having paid over 40% in tax for many years, found herself the victim of council spending cuts. Living with her brother in Lausanne in Switzerland, She had told me she felt abandoned by the state, and has decided she can endure no more. She blames UK Government cuts for her decision to die at Lifecircle in Basel. She was angry. Ken Loach, the filmmaker campaigning against benefit cuts, upon reading about Marie, has said she is a double victim – of “a debilitating illness and a brutal ­bureaucracy”."

This project is a challenge to myself. A challenge to unleash the creativity within myself and share it with the world. Art is a great outlet to start with since it is a form of expression. With this project I hope to express the abstract natures of perspective through drawing and color. Hopefully by the time I finish making 100 pieces of art, I will have grown in skill and character. By nature I am a photographer and love taking photos but decided to do drawings instead for this project. The challemge is to unlock the creativity within and inapire others to do the same. God bless you, I pray you consider donating to passion. Thank you"
577,1839017351,"This campaign is to assist with funding the First Film Festival to come to Catoosa County Ga. What started out as a festival targeting the SE US independent film makers. So they could showcase their films. Has turned into a film festival that received submissions from now ten countries including the U.S. 
I have several special guests who are coming to this festival and I would love to be able to surprise them all with more than they have asked for. Most of these guests have just asked for nothing more than gas and food. For a first year festival in a small county. I appreciate what they have offered to donate. Their time, and their money. I am sure other events may have paid them more, but they generously agreed to assist this one.
So I am trying to finish funding this festival, and to try to give back to those who have donated more than I could have possibly asked of them."

The Story:
Out of the enlightenment, both science and technology are born anew. As mankind continues to advance in scientific knowledge, breakthrough upon breakthrough compound, exponentially. Through this new technology, mankind is able to transcend its physical limitations by passing through the thought dimension and entering the supernatural.
The natural will become supernatural.  Welcome... to the new enlightenment!
The Prologue:
Page by Erwin J. Arroza
Minutes after a Super X58-Class solar flare (the equivalent of over a billion hydrogen bombs) erupts towards the Earth, modern technology becomes paralyzed and social stability is dismantled. As a result, several nations seize the opportunity to wage war in pursuit of global domination. The nations rage, buildings crumble, and desolation spreads to such an extent that the masses cry out for peace. A new coalition rises with an aim to rebuild and bring progress and stability back to humanity.
Page by Erwin J. Arroza
As peace and balance are restored, nations unite to avoid another devastating, cosmic tsunami. Forces combine in a global effort to prevent another world war. A task force is formed to probe deep into the human psyche, with the intent to eradicate man's propensity for violence. Over time, this movement grows with such intensity that it results in a multi-trillion dollar enterprise called Staunch Industries. Driven by necessity and fueled with ingenuity, technology advances to a point where we are granted access to the far reaches of our galaxy and deep into the hidden depths of our imagination. Human thoughts, memories, ideas, and emotions can now be fully explored in ways we have never DREAMED!

579,1872534716,"Embarquez: voilà la signification du mot inuktitut ""IKIVUQ"", c'est aussi le nom donné à cette grande aventure. Deux années de travail acharnées furent nécessaire afin de rendre possible cette expédition de canot au cœur de la toundra québécoise: vingt-six jours d'autonomie en territoire inconnu.
""Come aboard"" is the meaning of the Inuktitut word ""IKIVUQ"", it is also the name given to this great adventure. Two years of hard work were necessary to make this canoe expedition possible. Twenty-six days of autonomy in an unknown territory, in the heart of the Quebec tundra.

Les objectifs étaient nombreux: cartographier cette rivière sur laquelle on ne recensait encore aucune descente contemporaine, partager la grande beauté de ce territoire fragile, relever les traces d'une occupation inuite millénaire et inspirer le dépassement de soi. Finalement, quelque chose de bien plus personnel motivait ces six individus pour se placer dans un tel état de vulnérabilité, une quête propre à chacun que se propose d'explorer le documentaire Un Chemin à tracer.
This project had many goals: chart a river that was still unexplored by modern-day paddlers, share the beauty of this fragile territory, document the thousands of years of human life on the tundra and inspire people to surpass themselves. Ultimately, something more personal motivated these six individuals to place themselves in such a state of vulnerability, a quest unique to each. That is what the documentary film ""Un chemin à tracer"" will explore.
Depuis le tout début, mon objectif premier était de documenter et partager cette expérience. Vous avez été nombreux à suivre l'aventure, à nous écrire et nous encourager: je tiens à vous en remercier. Après maintenant plus de trois ans à travailler sur le projet, j'ai besoin de votre aide pour le dernier droit. Les fonds recueillis aideront à compléter le processus de post-production, un travail long et fastidieux, et ainsi réussir à partager cette aventure humaine.

After now more than three years working on the project, I need your help for the last right. Funds raised will help pay for the post-production, a long and tedious work. It will also make the translation process possible, which will allow us to share this human adventure."
580,358122756,"Michael Watson and Jade Yumang are a collaborative duo who were chosen to exhibit in the Governors Island Art Fair in New York, NY this coming September. Their first exhibition as a collaborative team, Watson and Yumang will be converting a room into a surreal funeral home installation about the life and death of conjoined twins. This visual narration speaks of the complexity of individual liberty, dissatisfaction, loneliness, familial ties, and chosen families.
Back Story
They were united for most of their life, secure and happy, but chose to go their separate ways. Once on there own, they had immersed themselves in polar opposite career paths and lifestyles. As much as they were used to being codependent they desperately wanted to be free. The void was never fulfilled and it eventually weakened them spiritually, emotionally, and physically, which lead to their death. They each died alone at the same moment in their own way. Now they have been rejoined in death.
Installation Layout
The installation will consist of three large photographs. One will be of a portrait of the twins still conjoined and the other two will be individual portraits. There will be long table in the center that divides the individual portraits, which are adjacent from each other, and the room. The table acts as a physical and symbolic separation. There will be two identical urns at the end of the table that mirrors the large portrait of the twins still conjoined. An oversized floral arrangement will cover the length of the long table coming out from the urns to the opposite end. This arrangement will roughly be the size of a double corpse lying on the table symbolically sprouting to rejoin the twins. The floral arrangement will decay for the duration of the show.
Raising funds for
Printing and framing costs for the 3 large photos (life size); supplies and labor for the table Van rental and gas/tolls to and from Governors Island; enormous flower bouquet; fabric for table and windows; two identical urns; paint for the walls; PR costs.

Welcome & Thank You For Visiting Our Page!
My name is Jackson R. Lazor, writer and director of Rot Hill. Over the last few years I have produced and directed various short horror films. However for years I have dreamed of making a full length feature film. 
 Almost two years ago my friend and business partner Matthew J. Kuhar (producer) and I set out to make a film that was terrifying, yet fun to watch. We ended up creating the project you see here, Rot Hill. We have focused on preproduction over the last 14 months. This provided us time to perfect the script, estimate an acceptable budget, create concept art & storyboards, and even shoot test footage (the video above). Our team has grown over the last few months to include many talented members.  
However we need your help. Matthew and I have personally invested funds into the film, but we need $6400 more to complete funding the project. We are offering different pledge rewards at different amounts along the right hand column. We are asking for your help, and for you to become apart of this project. We will finish the project, and we will have a wide home video release (RedBox, iTunes, Walmart, Best Buy).
 Against the best of their judgment, three teens decide to go camping on the infamous mountain known as Rot Hill. After one of them is found slaughtered, the town sets forth a search party. But as night nears various members of the search begin to disappear. Who will die, and who will live to tell of the darkness lurking on Rot Hill.
The Hacksaw Bride Concept Art
Above is concept art for the Hacksaw Bride featured in our film. Artwork is provided by our storyboard artist Brian Galley.
Films That Inspire Us
Rot Hill is deeply inspired by the classic slasher flicks of the 70's and 80's. Each member of our development team understands and respects the elements that made these films great. However Rot Hill seeks to find its own unique voice and stand on its own. We are not trying to reinvent the slasher genre. We are just looking to expand it and add to the universe. 
 To deliver an amazing, terrifying, yet authentic film that every horror collector/ fan would want to add to their collection. We have 3 main goals.
 1. Good Filmmaking! Just because a film is low budget doesn't mean that the movie should look low budget. A movie can look great with smart positioning  and use of lighting, camera shots, and sound work! We promise that despite our films budget, we will do everything to make it feel like a cinematic experience.
2. Only Practical Effects! Lets face it! CGI blood and gore just looks terrible. Everyone can tell its fake, and BOOM! Just like that the movie loses it's cinematic presence. We promise to only use realistic practical effects.
3. Rewatch Value! This seems to be the problem with a lot of current films. You buy a DVD once, watch the movie, and have no desire to ever watch it again. When developing the script for over a year, we focused on trying to build an interesting story, but one that you would want to revisit.This film is not being made to ride out a trend. It is intended to feel and look timeless.
How can you make this full length movie so cheap? The good news is we already own a lot of the equipment we need. We just need your help to pay for a few props, actors, and some lighting equipment. 
Production Budget
 In the end we are grateful for any pledge amount. This project will not not be possible without you. We need your support!"
582,1937598195,"    Welcome to Wilmington, Delaware! The City listed by Parenting.com as the #1 most dangerous city in America to raise a family. It is also the city where I grew up and became saved, the city where I received some of my education (both from universities and the lessons of life), a city where I started a family; and it's also the city that I love. I am B.K. Wilson: local filmmaker, international photographer, & activist against racism. I have worked with ABC News, trained in professional filmmaking at Universal Studios, and traveled halfway across the world to document other cultures. Now I'm documenting two cultures in, Dichotomy Brewing, my first publicly funded film. 
    I have been actively involved with the #BLACKLIVESMATTER movement since its early days with Trayvon Martin and Eric Garner. The daily reports from the media, the open discussions taking place in areas such as the bank and grocery store, and even the sermons in church all fueled my desire to raise my voice about the festering issue within all communities. 
   There's a brewing dichotomy in our nation and in my hometown. Two separate cultures: the black intercity civilians being characterized in the media as “thugs” and violent criminals, and the local police, state judges and other law enforcement that have been accused over the years of consistently breaking & bending the law to fit a “no justice, it's just us” and ""good ole boy""  mentality. These are two very opposite, distinct cultures and the conflict between them is bubbling to the surface, spilling over into open forums, street protests, and neighborhood rallies. Silence is no longer expected. Truth has been limited to the news, opinions of people who don't experience the dichotomy, and courtroom sues that address individual incidents but fail to fully address the conflict between the police culture and the intercity civilians whose rights are guarded by the NAACP. But the sum of a black man’s life cannot and should not be reduced to waiving opinions. It should be decreed by the truth, that ALL LIVES MATTER. 
""It is true that all lives matter, but it is equally true that not all lives are understood to matter which is precisely why it is most important to name the lives that have not mattered, and are struggling to matter in the way they deserve.""        - Judith Butler, Ph. D
   A local Wilmington man, Keith R. Booker, had a voice that has risen above his humility, while serving as President of the NAACP in Delaware. This film’s goal is to tell the story of Wilmington’s brewing dichotomy through his eyes. As the previous President of the local NAACP, he has done much for the City and for black local history. Telling this story from his perspective allows a credible, personal touch on a topic so misreported by people who don't actually live it. To avoid a one-sided perspective, I will be conducting interviews with local police, community leaders, and other lawmakers.  
    So far I have a completed script, fully drawn storyboards, an itemized budget, and a substantial number of committed volunteers willing to help shed light on this issue so the county can finally overcome this...Dichotomy Brewing. We've scheduled the film's completion for May 4, 2016. Hopefully, with your help we can earn enough to rent a silver screen for the opening night. With just a $5 contribution to the film you'll get a ticket to its screening and a public listing among film executive producers. Other sponsorship awards include: limited edition clothing and apparel, a private meeting with the cast and crew, DVDs of the film with behind the scenes footage, and for the highest contributors: an exclusive documentary project of your life by our team of professionals (see the various pledge options for further details)."

The funds would be used to hire a graphic designer to fix up the demo and to help pay for a software developer quote.

584,223552753,"The Westburner Baptist Church started as an idea and was formally incepted at Frog Pond Hot Springs in 2014.
The idea behind the camp is a parody of the Westboro Baptist Church, and in that vein, we adopt their style of protest-performance to stage protests of Burning Man Theme Camps (at their request), dust storms, heterosexuality, time, and anything else you can't really stop. 
We have secured excellent placement at the 3:00 & Plaza Portal to hold Mass this year, where we will be expounding on the virtues of the 10 Principles, listening to Alan Watts lectures, and holding Concept Album Dance Parties. 
In addition, we will also be holding two ceremonial Book Burning events at the beginning and end of the Burn, respectively, and providing a ""Playa Pet"" service, whereby Veteran Burners can sign up to take a Virgin Burner under their wing for the week and show them the ropes. 
Lastly, we will be hosting a confession booth, in which ""Confessions to God"" will be recorded and played anonymously at locations on the playa. 
While our camp has funded much of this on its own, our aspirations are in line with the Most High, and we hope to document the experience to share with others after the Burn. "
585,1509358151,"State Dinto is a film for anyone who has felt like they didn't quite fit in. It's the story of a search for our Selves. This film is for immigrants and descendants of immigrants who long for 'home.'It's for LGBTQ people who are curious about our place in the human story.  This film is for anyone who has been hurt and healed by, for, and in... LOVE.
As a queer/trans descendent of Italian immigrants, I found it particularly difficult to be fully ME in any space. Within my Italian American community, I tried to hide my queerness, and within my queer community, I tried to erase my Italianness. I didn't see how these things could overlap. When I was young and just coming out as gay, I actually didn't even think someone even could be gay and Italian. So, I lived most of my life between friend groups, dancing between community expectations and who I really, really, REALLY was. I traveled around the world for years, looking for ME. Where was she?
moment of anguish
In this film I explore my roots and search for belonging- the belonging that I have searched for in all of my travels and experiences of love. I try to understand myself and family's past through my relationships with my very loving parents, and through the eyes of my Nonna, who came from Italy. However, she is suffering from degenerative dementia and has memories that come in and out without a lot of clarity. I determine to go to Italy to learn about the life she left behind when she came to America, to understand more about who I am. When I get there, I meet beautiful folk musicians and dancers, who continue ancient traditions that are both sacred and profane, of the Catholic Church, and of goddess traditions that are much older. I find that there actually are people like me, who play(ed) a vital role to the culture! The femminielli! Male assigned people who have the souls of women. 
Neapolitan trans activist Loredana Rossi
We meet femminielli in this film, and learn about them, and see that we, TRANSPEOPLE, have always been here, walking between the worlds of masculine and feminine, life and death, reality and fantasy.
While all this exploring and learning happens, I am falling in love in real time on camera and having a hard time with it. My need for romantic love rears its head when my feelings for my videographer, Adam, who became one of my best friends, starts showing up in the footage. The way that my heart orients towards him, and then breaks, is all there, for you to witness and maybe even heal from.
The film doesn't document the journey- it IS the journey, complete with all of the tears and laughter and connection and understanding that we all need in order to be fully human.  
Dancing the tammorriata at La Candelora
Your financial contribution will be going towards post-production, because even though we have the footage, it's not enough! We need to edit this film! This money will go towards paying an editor and me to make a rough cut."

588,31040815,"What is the film about?
Color-blindness affects many people. Statistically, everyone in this country knows someone who is color-blind, though thankfully most of the time we are not affected by it. These are the stories of those who are affected, both by birth and by injury, both drastically and unknowingly. In our society, we cherish our visual field, but we also demand it to be understood uniformly. Policemen, firemen, pilots, army men, coast guard, railroad workers, electricians, astronauts, artists, and many more occupations won't allow for any inconsistency in color determination. You are either born capable, or born unable. Many who dream to serve their country, boldly explore, or even share their interpretation of life gain the skills necessary by putting forth an unyielding, uncompromising effort to become something they envision themselves to be; they strive to achieve, and sacrifice greatly to make something of themselves. In their world, they are perfect; but others often come to them and tell them their view of the world is incorrect. As a countless collection of passionate individuals are turned away from their dreams, our society loses something great.
This isn't necessarily the end of their road. There is a man, after many years of feverish research, capable of giving them colors to liven the world around them. With his help, many will be capable of achieving great and noble things. Hundreds every year are able to turn their lives around, but there are many, many more who still live in a depression, unaware of the opportunity to realize their dream.
As we follow a few men and women, bold enough to try anything, we find that some are too far away from the color spectrum to be helped. In their release from hope, some will find peace in the lives they can see for themselves. This is a documentary following people who are color-blind, but ultimately it is more than that. It is a film about the human condition, highlighting the capabilities of those who won't give up.
What We Need & What You Get 
We have carefully calculated everything we'll need to finish this film!
In order to tell the stories of the people who wrestle with color-blindness, we need to be able to show you what they're talking about. What are their dreams? What do they wish they could do? What has happened to them in their journey so far? Many times, we are unable to access secure locations such as police departments, fire stations, space exploration facilities, and other high-security locations; so in order to tell the story, we'll need to do some dramatic recreations! All these elements raise the cost of a production.
In trying to determine a budget for ""Life Without Color"", we collaborated to determine exactly what we would need to recreate the stories, who we'd need, and for how long. The figure we came out with to comfortably produce the film was ambitious, so we came out with new figures to give us the bare minimum to push our film forward.
Here's how your donations will be spent:
EQUIPMENT RENTAL: Cameras, lights, sound etc. We've got the majority of what we'll need, though there are some things we can use to make production value much higher, which will make what you see look even better.
CREW: The extremely talented folk needed to run that fancy equipment. 
CAST: Some we'll be able to get to volunteer, though not everyone can afford to be so generous. 
WARDROBE: In our society, we generally need clothes! 
FOOD: Got to feed all these folks during production!
LOCATIONS: As I mentioned above these are often times huge expenses.
POST-PRODUCTION COSTS: Editing, audio mastering, etc. 
While $30,000 is the MINIMUM we need to produce the film at a quality level I would be proud to present, any amount OVER the $30,000 we raise here will go towards making it an even more polished product as well as creating avenues for distributing it more widely to the world.
The Impact 
By backing this adventure, you will become a critical part that can change the lives of potentially millions of troubled citizens of the world. Many people are affected by color-blindness, but not everyone is affected negatively. This film will show those who are challenged to their very core by the condition, and documents the strength of their will to overcome and achieve their dreams. This is a very personal project for me, as I am color-blind myself, and I can therefore promise a personal stake in the integrity of story and sincerity in the message delivered by the film.
I am a story-producer, by day and night, feverishly researching new ways to tell story, and investing all of my heart in building fluency in the art of understanding. I am not only prepared to create something I believe will be special, I was born to do it.

The LIFE WITHOUT COLOR Crew:
Robb Jacobson - Director
Robb has a great passion, and has chosen to invest in one thing only. He believes, as human beings, our world revolves around story. Perspectives are how we dictate our feelings, how we connect from great distances, how we can love something we've never seen before.
We've always had story, and we've always struggled to show it in a unique light. But with struggle, we open up the potential for great triumph, the likes of which is paramount for creating a true connection between subject and audience.
Robb has background in a great many things, having held many different jobs (NPR, ABC, FOX, CBS, TLC, A&E). None of them have been the same, none of them have been directing film, but they've all had one central task: Storytelling.
Nothing demands more thought, consideration, and obsession in Robb's mind than finding new ways to tell story. It is what fuels his fire, and it will be the foundation in the creation of this documentary. He is investing everything he's worked for in this belief, and doesn't find anything to be more worthy.
Cindy Scott - Co-Producer
Cindy has worked as a jack-of-all-trades in media for the last ten years. Her entertainment career started at PBS in Grand Rapids, MI. Since then, she has worked on various productions in New York, Los Angeles and most recently Austin, where she currently lives with her hunky boyfriend ;-)
Cindy has directed projects with Emmy Award winning writer/producer Tom Caltabiano, as well as edited sizzle projects for the Emmy Award winning creator of ‘Everybody Loves Raymond’, Phil Rosenthal.
She also serves as a fundraising mentor for the Austin chapter of Team in Training, a non-profit fundraising program that raises funds for the world's largest voluntary health agency dedicated to blood cancer, The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS).
In her spare time Cindy loves to be outdoors. It is not rare to find her hiking, running or kayaking on your ordinary weekend.
Special Rewards
The Soundtrack! - Available at $15, $40, $75, $100
We have an ambitious goal to work with a composer/conductor to create original music for the film. A dedicated and personalized orchestra brings greater sound and clearer emotion for stories that deserve as much. The more funding we raise, the bigger the orchestra we can hire! Words often fail us, but music is the bridge between our hearts and souls. With this, we can connect you to the world of the color-blind!

The Poster - Available at $75
Option 1
  Option 2
You can choose between two options, both designed by our extremely talented graphic designer, Heston Godby! If you would like, the posters can also be signed by the director!

$100 - Be in the Movie!
Take a 1920x1080 photo of your eye (camera on your iPhone should work) of this size and we will use it at the end of the film to show the credits! Make sure your eye matches this photo as close as you can get it to, with the colorful iris touching the edge of the frame. It should be as in focus as possible, so have a friend take it for you. Try and show as much of your eye as possible, and we can crop out everything else to make it look nice! The names and titles of those involved will be in the pupil. But we'll add your name to the bottom right corner so you can easily identify your own eye. ;)
This is what it will look like on screen before we crop it to look perfect!
$150 - REALLY Be in the Movie!
Travel to Texas to film with us! We'll be using a good portion of our funding on creating re-enactments for stories told by the color-blind subjects, as well as creating general footage to round out the film. Our goal is to create a work that resembles the style of NPR's RadioLab (except it's for the big screen instead of radio)! You'll have to arrange for your own travel, stay, and transportation, but when you're on set, we'll use you in a big way, giving you significant screen time, to tell stories seen and felt by many! Our scheduled production will be during August and some of September of this year!

Meghan Sims - Colorblind Artist
Meghan was born with a rare visual condition called Achromatopsia. This means that she is completely colour blind, near sighted and extremely sensitive to light causing day blindness. Growing up, she had an immensely difficult time coping and adjusting to the world around her. She felt as though she was an outsider looking in, she felt that she was different, that she had no place here. Meghan had spent the majority of her life trying to hide this, trying to be “normal” and only found release and complete comfort when painting. 
Through her work, Meghan hopes to communicate her visual perception to the world around her in hopes of educating and connecting with others about what it is like living with Achromatopsia. Meghan is constantly exploring new mediums but works primarily with acrylics, discarded glass and photography. Acrylics allow the artist to work quickly as her eyes do not allow her to work for long periods of time. The use of glass and photography are used as vehicles for the artist to explore and simulate the sheer overpowering brilliance of light without causing her eyes harm. Meghan is extremely curious about the idea of perception. 
Through her work, she offers a two dimensional glimpse into the world of an Achromat. Through her work, she hopes to share the profound effect art has made in her life. She believes art has an intense power to heal and is a universal communicator for all to see."

590,639275182,"Inkromancy is a curated, collaborative Tarot Deck project made by tattoo artists from around the world. We wanted to create a way for tattoo clients, enthusiasts, and collectors to be able to have unique art pieces from some of their favorite tattoo artists (as well as discover new favorites!). Inkromancy 2: Apocalypse is our 2nd deck and it'll be a limited-edition deck with a one-time run. Each card features the work of a different tattoo artist, to create a complete, 78-card tarot deck. The back of each card features artwork by Jordanne Le Fae with silver foil accents. Keep your cards safe with a custom, rigid box featuring the Inkromancy design. Each box is individually numbered in this limited-edition printing. Only 1,000 decks will be made!
Check out some of the card art below, the card names and numbers will be added to all the cards, so stay tuned to the campaign for more card art as it progresses. 
Card titles will be added before printing.
More cards to be added soon!
Deck Specs:
Standard tarot card size (70 x 120 mm)
300gsm art paper
Rigid 2-piece box
The idea started from a desire, when founder Jordanne Le Fae wanted to work with other tattoo artists in a collaborative way, creating something completely unique together. Inkromancy is also a way for clients and consumers to develop new connections with tattoo artists they haven't heard of before. This tarot deck promotes collectible art as well as a unique way to find your next tattoo artist! The long-term dream is to continue to create yearly decks with different themes: neotraditional, traditional, black and white, realism, nuschool... etc. BUT! This deck is themed around the fact that 2020 was a real Apocalypse for most of us, and our artists channeled their creativity around that!"

594,974641028,"I NEED YOUR SUPPORT TO LAUNCH A DARK FANTASY COMIC BOOK SERIES.
I'm Dan O'Callaghan, an Ardent Comics creator, and I've recently finished making my very first Comic Book series, Descendant of the Nephilim.
This collected edition will bring the first four issues together in one wicked volume, it also includes a few pages of conceptual artwork and script sample excerpts as well.

This is my 112-page dark fantasy comic book series, about a young magician who has the souls of the dead trapped in his veins and who desperately wants to find a cure to his curse.

ABOUT THE BOOK
Descendant of the Nephilim is about a young man who has run away from home or to put it another way, has escaped his father’s kingdom of supernatural beings.
Will, wants to forget the Nephilim Kingdom and using his supernatural powers, he finds a place to hide in plain sight, performing mistake-filled magic acts at a run-down theatre, what he really wants though is to find a cure to his inhuman abilities and become his own man, but evil forces are trying to pull Will back into the dark world of The Nephilim.
There are some classic themes that run through this series of what we inherit from our parents, our predetermined destiny and how we can break it, but these themes are explored in unusual ways that are inherent to Will’s supernatural powers, about the objects and people in our lives, what value they have for us and how death affects our relationship with them.
The art of this series reflects the story; it is mutated, fancifully deformed and intricate. One central idea behind the art of DOTN was to do away with comic book panels or frames, if you like, to explore the concept of images within images, much like the theme in DOTN of souls carried within the bodies of others.
Will hides in plain sight, amongst the humans as a lowly magician, an occupation shrouded in peculiarity and intrigue, somehow makes it easier to hide his abilities.

THE MISFITS
 Flower Face Charlie was the first soul spawn that Will created when he popped a pimple and a single drop of blood fell onto a flower.
THE MURDERERS

Frank the Nephilim king wields control over the soul spawns, unlike any other Nephilim, creating violent monstrosities and frightening freaks of nature.

ABOUT ME
Daniel O'Callaghan
Hi I’m Dan, I began publishing comic books under the label of Ardent Comics in 2014, after working a number of jobs in many different artistic and non-artistic fields.
A year later, I met Jessica Gibson at a local comic book convention and not too long after, the two of us started working on Feral Horizon, marking myself and Jessica’s first collaborative comic book series.

Descendant of the Nephilim was the first comic book series that I wrote and illustrated, in my early twenties.
This series is very much a teenager’s story though; the themes and ideas behind the series, I think started to develop in my head, way back in high school.

I've published a few comic book Issues of a couple of mini-series now and have toured up and down Australia, sharing them with story and art hungry audiences of all kinds."
595,1836682034,"Christian World gives people information about God and His power, Christianity around the world, and it evangelizes and teaches people. Newspapers are inherently trusted by the ministry’s target audience, the former Soviet Union people, because they have been taught by the communist government to trust the newspapers.
     Christian World is an independent, non-denominational newspaper. A wonderful variety of Christian churches including Pentecostal, Baptist, Charismatic, Church of God, Lutheran, Salvation Army, Orthodox, and Catholic take part, working together by sending articles, and ordering and distributing copies of Christian World. Because Christian World is nondenominational, it does not favor or criticize any denomination or religion. “Christian World” just invites people to come to Jesus Christ, and the people respond. Because the paper is distributed through the mail, it reaches people who want to know about Jesus but are still afraid to go to church. It reaches those who are unable to attend worship due to disability; and it reaches many persons who live in small villages where there is no church. Do people respond to the Gospel via Christian World? Pastors have told us of people who came to Church and accepted Jesus as Savior through the influence of our newspaper. Because it is an officially registered nationwide newspaper, many government officials recognize it.
  We need to say some more about distribution. One of them is by subscription. It is a major way by which we distribute it. Ukraine has a different subscription system than America. In order to subscribe to a newspaper, people must go to the Post Office and select the publication from an official catalog. After that they receive it by mail. Christian World has an agreement with the Ukrainian general Post Office, which advertises the paper through a catalog in every post office in the country. People have the opportunity to subscribe to the Newspaper not only for themselves but also for their unbelieving friends, relatives, and even enemies. We received a letter from one lady who subscribed for four people, and she has done this before. Last year she subscribed for six people. Now, one of them has purchased a subscription for himself, and another has started to go to church.   
 Single copies of Christian World are sold through news stands, small shops, and at the Post Office. People who do not want to subscribe, or who want to try a single copy, can readily pick up a copy in their neighborhood.
Christian World is also available in a number of churches. Some Churches and Church Unions across Ukraine order it regularly to distribute to their members, and to evangelize in their communities. Every year churches in Ukraine, order and distribute Christian World in their local region by going from apartment to apartment distributing thousands of copies. When Dr. Paul Yonngi Cho, from South Korea, pastor of the largest church in the world, came to Kiev in 1996, several Pentecostal and Baptist unions ordered special issues of Christian World which featured him and South Korea. Korean pastors, worked with Viktor, providing the material about Pastor Cho and his church. Viktor presented the special issue of the paper to Pastor Cho in the Kiev airport when he arrived. Ten thousand copies were distributed in Dinamo Stadium during the three days of evangelization meetings.
In April 2005 Kharkov city was visited by the very well known Korean pastor and preacher Le Cho Soc. He has a church of 15,000 people in Seoul. Mainly he preaches about healing. For his visit Viktor prepared a special issue of “Christian World”, like he did it for pastor Cho. Viktor was given the materials about him and his ministry from his people. After the meeting, Viktor and a few other pastors had dinner with pastor Soc, and took an exclusive interview for “Christian World”. 
 Unfortunately, all the activities were slowed down and stopped during 2011-2012 years. Viktor’s wife Nataly got sick with a cancer and went through several surgeries and then through radioactive treatment and rehabilitation. It took several years just fighting, struggling, and concentrating on family needs.
 Other member of RESL board about same time went through the life cataclysm also and their lives were dramatically changed.
Economic downturn in USA after 2008 played big role in loosing a lot of supporters.
Registered organization in USA (RESL) was lost. Organization in Ukraine Christian World had been saved.
During all those years after 2012 Viktor had been thinking that Christian World would never be revived. Situation was broken past not only in USA but also in Ukraine.
Another revolution. People in Ukraine were fighting for a better life. But as it turned out the new Ukrainian president and government more corruptive and deceitful than previous. Russian president Vladimir Putin used the chaos and instability inside Ukraine to take some territories and start armed conflict on the east of Ukraine not far from the city where Viktor was born and where Christian World was published.
All these circumstances threw the country in very deep downward economic crisis. More than two millions refuge inside the country searching for new homes, because the old one had been destroyed. It seems, people were only thinking how they could buy a food and pay their bills. Viktor’s last visit to Ukraine in 2016 showed that ordinary people were disorientated, depressed and looking for help more than ever before. They do not want to live in a country where corruption is everywhere. The people fight against corruption. They also do not want to go back to USSR, which Putin wants to restore. They want to live good but do not know how. Who else can help them and give them hope if not Jesus? So, Viktor came back to the USA with a desire to renew the ministry and help again the Ukrainian people to find help in Jesus.
As previous ministry RESL had begun on boundary old and new 1994 years. This passage from old to new 2017 years emphasize new beginning.

596,930024655," Hello! We are PIANOCHOCOLATE and let us present our amazing music. 
     Have you ever thought about what the modern music is now? I guess yes, and you probably asked this question far more than once. And let’s be honest to each other: the most part of all the musical projects of the last several years could be compared only with fast-food products. That insipid heap of different sounds bringing some kind of transient joy at the first time disappears from our memory rapidly as if it hadn’t even been heard and leaves upsetting aftertaste at worst… 
     That is why there is nothing astonishing in the fact that we are trying to back to something old again and again, we are listening to significant records made by people who considered music not as just some kind of pure business. The music of the past times breathes the honesty and seems to us more alive than lax sub products of the musical industry of the present. 
     But coming back to the same music over and over again is, in spite of our great love, simply making no headway or, to be more precise, endless replay. 
     Our project called PIANOCHOCOLATE is a symphony of beautiful melodies, tender sounds of violins and pianos, a combination of some neoclassical elements – that Is why almost all our tracks are instrumental… PIANOCHOCOLATE is a carefully thought-out synthesis of all the best things that we have in modern electronic music and sincere warmness brought by bands and composers of some earlier times. We’ve tried to borrow the highest level of quality from some modern projects and addressed to a broad range of opportunities which our present time can offer. On the other hand, PIANOCHOCOLATE has got the same warmness and sincerity like the old music had – to cut the long story short, let us say that our project gathered all the best things presented by different musical epochs. 
     We want this music, which makes the one stop, think and go away from the breakneck rhythm of life for at least a few minutes of harmony and calmness to be heard by people tired of artificiality. By people looking for something that would awake pure and light dreams and thoughts. By people, who do not just live a life but are able to appreciate every single moment. So, it is you who can help us to make this dream come true and give us a chance to offer to people not a disposable surrogate but a real qualitative music. 
     A new album is planned to be produced in autumn of 2012, and it’s up to you to make our project even better than now. The opportunity to pay for the working in the studio of a top-class together with mixing and mastering engineers of standing reputation would help us to bring the sound of PIANOCHOCOLATE to perfection. 
     Supporting PIANOCHOCOLATE you are assisting not just another musical project, but, more than that, giving a chance to prove that music is not a source of money, not a business and not a way to stunning popularity. Music is a wish to give people some piece of light and to share a melody of one’s own inner harmony."

Over the course of three days, Richard Hammer and photographer Mike Larremore will embark on a photographic journey through the heartlands of Michigan to capture a softer Richard for your viewing enjoyment.
Richard Hammer has been lucky enough to express himself daily on Twitch. However, he has been restricted by the rules.  Help him express himself without the constricting clothing he is normally forced to wear.
Backers of this project will be treated to high resolution images in many different forms. THESE PHOTOS HAVE NOT YET BEEN TAKEN. YOU MUST TRUST US. WE WILL DO OUR BEST TO GIVE YOU WHAT YOU CRAVE.  Some of these items may have options and on those we may let you decide which photos you receive.
Funding will be dedicated to props, travel, and equipment, for the world's first official photoshoot featuring Richard ""Dick"" Hammer. Someone was kind enough to donate the printing costs on many of these items. However, she had one rule: the money must be put into a college fund for Alice, Richard's daughter.
Not only will you be helping Richard truly express himself, but you will also be helping him raise money for his child's college fund.
Thank you."
598,532669939,"Hello, my name is Anouk Kruithof and I am a Netherlands born artist living in New York. For almost 12 years I have been exploring and questioning the picture-plane, image, materiality, physicality and philosophy of the medium photography. My multi-layered, mostly idea-based interdisciplinary projects take the form of photographs; photographic, video or spatial installations; text; sculpture; take-away ephemera and performance. Besides all that I am a frenetic artistbook-maker! I've made 9 books so far, which u can check out here:
the black hole
becoming blue
playing borders (this contemporary state of mind)
the daily exhaustion
happy birthday to you
a head with wings
pixel-stress
untitled (I‘ve taken to many photo’s / I’ve never taken a photo) 
the most recent one, the bungalow 
my 9 books till so far....
I started Stresspress.biz last year, its a versatile publishing platform that includes my various book projects, some of my critical writings about artists’ books and my short fictional stories. Over the coming years Stresspress.biz will develop into a platform for collaboration with other writers and artists on publishing in the extended field.
an impression of the pages out of AUTOMAGIC
I've been working on AUTOMAGIC since May 2011.  It will be an extensive book which contains images and text out of the past 12 years of my ""automagic archive"". The book does not attempt to have a clear narrative, thus this will be created by the viewer from their own memories and associations towards the open-image stories and stimulated by text notes and short fictional stories.
AUTOMAGIC refers to the unexplainable behaviour of something
At this moment there’s a lot of research about how taking photos changes our perspective in memory. We’re outsourcing our memory to the cards in our camera’s and our smart phones, and the interruption of attention when taking a picture can also hinder our future retrospection. I am pretty guilty of those thoughts, because I am always framing the world and always have been, since the moment I got my first camera as a child. My memories might not be rooted in my mind as actual memories of events, but unreal memories created by taking photos, looking at them and reworking them. 
My book AUTOMAGIC is an exploration and demonstration, which represents a transformed image archive by means of analogue photo-montages, screenshots, reproductions, editing and the addition of text. AUTOMAGIC will be hardcover US letter size, almost 2 inch thick book, consisting of many different chapters printed on different paper. The diversity of chapters and topics, the tactility of the paper feel will make of this book a layered sculpture. 
a limbo between fact and fiction
 there is no appropriation in this book
This book shows the adventure, the sheer infinity of possibilities of the medium photography as a vehicle of resourcefulness and the computer and human mind as processors of ways to look at our world. 
The photos out of which AUTOMAGIC exists were made in: 
Turkey, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Jamaica, Panama, Australia, Korea, Morocco, Egypt, Tunesia, New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Joshua Tree Park, Woodstock, Syracuse, Boston, Richmond, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Beetsterzwaag, Paris, France, Sardinia, Venice, Italy, Barcelona, Spain, Belgium, Berlin, Germany, Switzerland, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Austria, Prague, Slovakia, Slovenia, Stockholm, London, Leeds, Bristol, Mexico, Guatemala, Belize and the OCEANS...
 A clear conceptual starting point in the process making this book was to deliberately mix all origins (date and place taken) in an attempt to erase geographical locations and its borders and unify people with different religion, culture, age, gender and nationality. 
A book as holistic idea
As u might know or not know, artistbook-making is a very unprofitable thing to do. I love bookmaking, that’s why I've made 9 books so far in collaboration with different independent publishers from all over the world, and as well self-published 2 of them. Every time I am thinking of producing a book there is this huge hesitation on the... 
“ok where do I get the money from to realize this book-dream”                   
… I will self-publish AUTOMAGIC under stresspress.biz and I know this thick book with more than 1000 pages, the high-end features, such as the printing on different pages, the proper binding and the painting of the 3 paper sizes of this book (the book becomes a yellow rectangle block-object with nothing on it) will have high costs. Not to even talk about paying my collaborators, such as interns, the graphic designer, translators, text-editors I work with, studio-rent, flight-tickets, material and so on…
I have never created a Kickstarter before, but I've supported some fundraiser-campaigns of others I encountered through friends, acquaintances and colleagues. I am doing this Kickstarter campaign, to raise money for the production of the book AUTOMAGIC. If I exceed my goal of raising 25.000 euro, I will use the additional proceeds for the development of stresspress.biz as a publishing platform, which is needed too. 
<< !! Without your help AUTOMAGIC won’t become reality !! >>
I am super grateful for your support! 
thank you very much!
AUTOMAGIC will be published in an edition of 500 or 1000 depending on the requests through this campaign and the books will be numbered and ""KISSED-INSTEAD-OF-SIGNED"" on request. 
Most likely published under stresspress.biz but I am open for collaborations with publishers as well. It will depend on possibilities for collaboration, so let's wait a bit and see...
Underneath you get an impression how this looks. For Kickstarter backers their AUTOMAGIC books will be ""KISSED-INSTEAD-OF-SIGNED"" for sure!
impression of how a print or book looks like, when it's numbered and ""kissed-instead-of-signed""
I GOT MANY QUESTIONS REGARDING THE BUDGET. I got questions like: ""25.000 EURO IS A HUGE AMOUNT FOR JUST A BOOK"" 
underneath I ll explain the costs of this book. Publishing a book of the size US letter / A4 about 2 inches thick and 1000 up to 1500 pages is quite an object, not to compare with any of my previous books in terms of size. I will work with a high-end printer and binder and my hero graphic designer: Christoph Nussli.
printing: 22.000
binding: 5000 
designer: 3000
material costs: 1000
?? costs for : storage, a company sending out the books, mailing costs
quite a lot of the money collected over Kickstarter will flow back to the backers in terms of the rewards, prints, books, Skype-calls, meetings.. To mail the rewards to everyone and making them costs money too so basically you have to minus those from the amount of 25.000 euro as well, in the sense of what's left after those expenses.
I want to exceed my goal of 25.000 euro, because with that amount I can't even make the book, I will because I will invest myself and/or find another source to fill any gaps. 
I hope this clarifies something for people who don't know how expensive and not lucrative artist-book-making is."

600,1933995228,"This film has been my baby since 2007. I have done a lot of work on this project with a lot of my own money. However we do need a little help to finish this project. I have a deep passion for writing and acting and this film is a culmination of both of those passions. I have dedicated 8 years of my life to making this work and I will keep fighting regardless of how this all turns out. I know there are a lot of people out there asking for your money and I can appreciate that. This isn't just another hey, let me have your money for something I will never finish kind of deal. Eight years of my life have gone into this project and if I haven't quit or given up in that period of time I'm not going to stop now. People will always tell you something can't be done or that it's stupid or whatever they say to make themselves feel better but there is a long history of people who have become successful because they believed and they never gave up. All I ask is for a chance to show you that hard work and determination can culminate into something great. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Short summation of the film-
Off the coast of Florida lies a small atoll known as Temple Island. Life for it's citizens is ordinary, that is until one morning an emergency call goes out. It reaches the highest levels of the US Government. A team of highly trained Marines is dispatched to investigate. 
What they uncover is both shocking and unbelievable. What happened to the islands inhabitants? Why were they sent? More importantly... Will they come back?
The Undead Conspiracy takes you on a roller coaster thrill ride. The team will be tested, loyalties will be tested. In the end the team must work together to survive an enemy more deadly then the Undead hordes!"

Master Diluc and Fischl, the Prinzessin der Verurteilung join INKCRAFT 2020! They are both drawn at 2x the usual size of my other InkCraft artworks. And for the first time, I used metallic-gold ink to help accent the effects in the artwork. I am really pleased with how they turned out!

The original Fischl, the Prinzessin der Verurteilung has found a home already. However, Master Diluc is still seeking a warm and loving home and is available as a reward tier.  As this is the original drawing, there will only be 1 of it available.

We received numerous requests for prints of Master Diluc and Fischl, the Prinzessin der Verurteilung. I did not want to make the usual art prints as they wouldn't be able to bring out the pretty effects created by the metallic-gold ink accents. We spoke with our awesome production team and are currently working with them to create special prints with metallic-gold ink to reproduce the shimmer effect on the original art. These are available on this Kickstarter as a new reward tier, or as an add-on, should you wish to stick to your existing tier but want these prints as well.

I hope you enjoy both Master Diluc and Fischl, the Prinzessin der Verurteilung as much as I did when creating them. Thank you for your support and love!

 In late 2019, Rachta started on INKCRAFT - an artbook containing the complete collection of her drawings during the month of October. It was launched together with her Artist Journey to a huge success.
However, we felt that we wanted to share more. Like her Artist Journey, we didn't want INKCRAFT to be just an artbook. We want to recreate the experience one has while watching Rachta draw in-person. Hearing the pen nib's scratches; watching each individual lines get drawn out; seeing the colors fill the empty spaces, these are the sights and sounds that we want to share with you in INKCRAFT 2020.
 Rachta is currently realizing her dream of bringing her world to reality through her manga. when taking a break from creating gripping stories and breathtaking scenes, Rachta would often be found sketching her favorite pop culture characters.

As some of you might also be aware, I've previously attempted to get this project funded about six months ago. At the time, the project was listed with a much higher goal as well. The project was unsuccessful for a few reasons but I think it was probably because I didn't do a good enough job promoting the book itself and showing potential new readers what they can expect of the book.
This forced me to go back to the drawing board and try to tackle the project from a few different angles. The primary one that's allowed me to relaunch with for a much smaller goal is that I've found a different printer that could provide the books at a significantly lower cost than my initial printer, without compromising any quality. Based on the samples that I was provided, I believe that the quality is even better than my original one.
I've also decided to try to provide a different variety of rewards and researched different manufacturers to find the best price to get these new rewards done.
And lastly, I also took the time to save some of my own money to pay for a larger portion of the print run myself.
All this allowed me to significantly lower the project goal and a completely redesigned project page and video will hopefully allow you all to get a much better sense of what to expect from Brainslug: Alien Tongues.

Those that Volunteered to help make the documentary and score the music did a great job and didn't complain a bit, I don't think they did... It was 5 years in the making of the documentary and every dime I had, I lost everything, but for some reason I couldn’t stop trying to get it done and with Gods help I did. The money we are looking for is a small amount for a big project like producing a music CD, but we have committed people with the talent and experience to help. We are closer to completing both the documentary and a CD for the world to enjoy. We have scheduled a CD release party in April and I would really like you to be there.
This song Keep Going On was sang by: Blair B. Lee, Batume and others will be on the CD. There will be a total of 6 songs on the CD for you to enjoy.
Some people are followers and some are doers. But for the ones that are followers to be in support of a doer makes you a doer as well. This project is for all the doers and followers that want to keep on keeping on and to help others to do the same. You will be looked at as doers no matter who you are. This project touches the heart string of every person who have followed their dream and may have fallen short, so I can say I’m one of you. "

Lauderdale's ""James's Gate"" and Boston's ""Hiring Fair"") playing in packed pubs and festivals from Miami to Maine. But three kids and the war in Afghanistan interrupted my plans. It's time to change that and get back in the saddle. It's time for a real solo project, focusing on my three favorite things: Love, Whiskey, and Rebellion -- but not necessarily in that order.
Those three kids cost a ton of cash, and without a record label, I don't have the funds to manufacture those pretty little silver discs. That's where you come in. Every little bit helps, and every little bit goes to the manufacture of my CDs, licensing three or four songs that are not original or in the public domain, and some VERY limited marketing.
Every level of rewards includes a copy of the music!
The good folks at DiscMakers.com are standing by to print these once I'm done recording. My goal is to have the disc ready to go for St. Patrick's Day, a tight but achievable schedule.
You can hear three of my original songs as recorded by ""Hiring Fair"" at  https://www.facebook.com/IrishSoldierBoy/app_178091127385, and I'm also crowdsourcing some of the LWR content there as well. You can also suggest songs for the project through Twitter, @IrishSoldierBoy.

Thanks everyone for making the Runners Volume 1: Bad Goods Kickstarter campaign a great success!! It was a bit of a nail-biter for a little bit, but the campaign rallied in the last several days to end strong. Thanks for all the pledges and especially the kind words of support for the series. It's been a while since the last book, so it's great to know fans are still excited for more, and more is certainly coming!
I'll be finishing the coloring of Volume 1 over the next few months, and then it's on to Volume 3!! Visit runnersuniverse.com and sign up for the mailing list to be notified when the new story arc starts posting later in 2018!
For anyone who missed the campaign, you can order the new color edition of Runners Volume 1: Bad Goods, as well as Volume 2: The Big Snow Job, from my runnersuniverse.com Store. Both books are available in PDF, paperback, and hardcover (limited quantities) editions. A limited number of reward items, like prints and character cards, will also be available.
And I'll see you all at runnersuniverse.com for Volume 3!! Thanks again!!
UPDATES:
Update 5-30-18: International Shipping Bonuses: I know international shipping costs are a bit of a deterrent. Paying $24 shipping for a single book is a real gut-punch. I can’t do anything about the cost, but I'd like to make that bitter pill a little easier to swallow. So for international backers, I will make this offer: back the campaign at either the Vol 1 Paperback Signed level ($25) or the Vol 1 Hardcover Signed level ($30), and I will automatically include the 3 prints and 7 character cards FOR FREE during fulfillment! So you'll be paying around $50, including the shipping, but at least you'll get the $50 tier of rewards. I hope this takes some of the sting off of the high shipping costs. (Unfortunately, I can’t extend this offer to pledges for both books, since the two books alone comes out to 3 lb, but the extras would push the weight into the 4 lb cost.) 
""Aliens, Smugglers, Pirates. And they're the GOOD guys.""
Hi there! I'm Sean Wang and I've worked as a writer and artist on comics like Tick and Arthur (New England Comics) and Meltdown (Image Comics). But I'm best known for my creator-owned sci-fi series Runners...
Runners is a fun sci-fi action comedy about a crew of alien smugglers led by reluctant captain Roka Nostaco and his acerbic co-pilot Ril Mar. They're joined by two pirates, jokey sharpshooter Cember Koji and former mob enforcer Bennesaud. There's Bocce, a humanoid with a shape-shifting energy arm, and Sky, a mysterious alien girl with some unusual powers of her own. The series follows their exploits as they struggle to complete hazardous intergalactic runs while constantly hounded by pirates, bounty hunters, police, and the occasional conscience.   
Runners Vol 1: Bad Goods, originally came out as a black-and-white book to much critical acclaim. It focuses on one particular run for the mob that spirals out of control, including shootouts with pirates, dogfights with bounty hunters, and an all-out, three-way ship, cycle, and foot chase through the streets of an alien space station.
Old b&w Runners Vol 1: Bad Goods
It was followed by Runners Vol 2: The Big Snow Job, which found the crew taking on a seemingly trivial job on a frozen planet that turned out to be more than they bargained for, forcing them to deal with a hostile native population, a band of evil mercenaries, a mob power play, and a series of treacherous double-crosses. Like Volume 1, it received excellent reviews, but unlike the first book, the second was in full color.
Runners Vol 2: The Big Snow Job
To fit the new and ongoing aesthetic of the series, I am now going back and coloring Volume 1, and I’m hoping comic and sci-fi fans will help me fund the printing of the book here on Kickstarter. 
This new version of an old favorite will consist of:
Paperback or Kickstarter exclusive hardcover
176 pages, with the entire story newly colored
The very first 7-page short story
Sketchbook pages
Bonus content new to the color edition
Runners Vol 1: Bad Goods paperback or hardcover, unsigned or signed with head sketch
Set of three 8”x10” Vol 1 prints
Set of seven 4""x6"" Vol 1 Character Cards
8""x10"" inked portrait and toned-paper commission
11""x17"" inked commission of entire crew
Original Art: cover (11""x17"") and all 7 character card illustrations (8""x10"")
And these are the reward tiers:
Shipping will be added to reward tiers based on country during checkout. Unfortunately, international shipping is very expensive and there isn’t really anything I can do about that. But I do ship worldwide if you are willing to pay the shipping. Remember: digital files are always an option in those cases to avoid international shipping costs, and digital versions of both volumes are available!
The following additional items can be added on to reward tiers:
See sample pages from Snow Job Sketchbook
See larger image of Snow Job Battle Royale print
I did the first two books in my spare time, which made it hard to really build momentum. I am now planning to do the series full-time until the entire story is told. At this point I have plotted out the entire remainder of the series, including every major plot turn and character arc.
Runners story wall for Vol 3-10
Additionally, Volume 3 is already fully scripted and ready to go (after a concepting phase). New pages will start posting on runnersuniverse.com later in 2018. I have a LOT more planned for the series and will be producing it on a much more regular and consistent schedule going forward.
If you're still on the fence, please check out the series at www.runnersuniverse.com, where both books are available in webcomic form. And here are a few quotes from comic professionals and reviewers:
""Runners is the best science fiction adventure I have read in years. It has wonderfully fleshed out characters, a terrific story, and great action sequences."" --Stan Sakai; Usagi Yojimbo
""Runners is a truly fun and beautifully illustrated alien rag-tag space smuggler comic that feels as comforting as any of your favorite sci-fi-mythos while still being something unique in its own galaxy frontier."" -- David Petersen; Mouse Guard
""Sean Wang's impressive art demonstrates the glorious imagination and colorful detail you want in a science fiction adventure. His exotic aliens make for a visual feast. If the Star Wars cantina customers took on Firefly-like mercenary jobs, you'd have Runners."" --Johanna Draper Carlson; www.comicsworthreading.com
""One of the best comic book universes doesn’t belong to DC, Marvel or even Archie… it belongs to Sean Wang’s incredible series, ‘Runners’!"" Since I first read the original, I have championed 'Runners' as the best independent comic ever produced. It's beautifully drawn and written with so much passion and charm."" -- Matt Herring; www.secretidentitypodcast.com

Screenplay and Storyboard
We´re independent filmmakers from Cologne, Germany, currently studying and teaching Film at the Macromedia University and the Akademie Deutsche Pop. Throughout the last year we put so much effort into writing, discussing and planning this movie that it’s became a true project of the heart. Inspired by the human fear, author and director Toni Stintzing developed a thrilling screenplay about going through the horror of dealing with a dreadful experience. Now it is ready to get adopted into an amazing short film (that will keep it‘s audience clinched to their seats). To create this project in a manner that lives up to our ideas, we need your help! So JOIN us and make this project happen ;)
The Main Crew behind ""The Follower""
Toni Stinzing (top left) is the creative mind of our film project. Using inspiration from biographical experience and observing important topics of our time, he developed the screenplay and takes on the role of the Director, which is no problem since Toni is a passionate person, constantly working on films with an overview of all the departments. In his freetime Toni gained popularity as a fitness professional. 

As a graduated graphic designer André Becker (top mid) is able to undertake all kinds of creative compositions, starting from filming, illustrating, designing, editing, drawing to animating stunning 3D-Objects. As a camera operator he already produced music videos and award-winning short films, that captivate the audience by their unique approach. His passion for art and filming is inimitable for his job as our Director of Photography and once he committed to a project, he’s willing to give it his all."" 

Our Camera Operator is not only a videographer for high quality fashioncollections and musicians, but Pasindu Goldmann (top right) is also a popular DJ, going by the name of „Schooki“. He’s a very open minded, optimistic person and it doesn’t matter which creative field Pasindu takes on, he’s always capable of giving things a unexpected touch.

Gregory Hegel (bottom left) combines the characteristic of being professional and passionate and he's also warmhearted and loyal. In addition to his study of film he also starred as an actor in a feature film production and convinced as an empathic and talented person. So who else should have been our Assistent Director.

To create a film you need the help of someone who is capable of organizing - Whether it is finances, locations or human resources. Mitti Nghiem (bottom mid) is the right woman for the job of the Producer, because of her diligence and conscientious. But nevertheless working with her is never boring, since her joyful spirit and honest passion for filmmaking is always noticeable.

Music is Maciej Kuleszas (bottom right) preferred means of expression. And he’s well aware of the mediums power. The young creative from Warsaw knows exactly when to go big, but he’s also able to give the film space when it’s needed. His work is never cluttered rather subversive and authentic. We are very grateful to call him a part of our team.
Check out his latest Video:

Of course that is not everybody. There are also people for light/grip, audiorecording, assistants and other helping hands!

Everybody from the crew voluntarily works on this project, except Maciej because we want to support him!
Why do we need your help?
We're all students, but it is a personal project and therefore it is not related to any task for university. Which means we have to organize a whole lot and work things out to make it happen on a very low budget.
What happens If the project gets funded?

Thanks to you we can:
rent proper gear
rent locations
pay our actors!
pay festival fees
make a great film together with you!

610,1187863701,"Music is a commodity that is consumed almost every moment of every day. Yet there is no professional service that helps musicians understand how to enter the industry and promote their work.  
  PROJECT SUMMARY:
Desi Music Entertainment, LLC is a startup California-based record label (or ""artist-incubator"") that aims to cultivate, nurture, and promote independent Indian artists world-wide. We need enough capital to launch 10 artists in 2015 - which will culminate in a compilation album set to release in early 2016. 
Funds earned from Kickstarter backers will not only go towards creating this album, but also towards ""incubating"" the artists. Each artist will receive tutorials on self-promotion, marketing and social media plus photo shoots, music production, music video production and international digital distribution.  
Without the community's support, this album won't happen!
BACKGROUND (Video transcript)
I have been formally studying and/or teaching music for 27 years. I started working for Oscar-winning composer A.R. Rahman 6 years ago to help set up his conservatory. And for the past decade, I’ve performed in concerts around the world, I’ve conducted the KMMC chamber choir for the In Memoriam segment of the 2012 OSCARS, I’ve sung in scores of Bollywood films, and I was awarded the TED fellowship for being an entrepreneur and pioneer in music.
But about a year ago, I was like “wait a minute.” Life is short! and there’s a fire in my heart that wants more. So when I was thinking about what direction I wanted to go in, I started looking for services that would mold me as an artist and composer and teach me the basics of music marketing, promotion, and social media plus help me with the actual production of my work.
The problem is, it doesn’t exist. Why is there no service that provides artists with basic guidance to help them accomplish what they want to do in life?
Introducing, Desi Music Entertainment. The concept of DME lies somewhere between a music business university program/record label/artist management company. We are what you’d call an “artist incubator” and we will sit down with the artist and discuss what their dream is and come up with a strategy on how to get there - sort of like a college prep company that kids use to get into university. Our services include concept creation & strategy, photo shoot, social media tutorials, basics in music promotion and marketing plus the actual production of their music, mastering by Universal studios, production of their music video, and online distribution. I know what you're thinking - It's a LOT! But the basic concept is - when the artist has one company that's holding their hand through this long process, it’s not only cost effective, it takes way less time, and they end up with one cohesive public identity that sets the tone for the rest of their career.
The best part is, we won’t own the copyright of their work.
As an experiment, I wrote, directed and produced a track called Solidarity Song featuring well-known Bollywood and Kollywood artists to generate interest in the company and to celebrate India’s Independence Day. The response was unbelievable.
The videos have accumulated 40,000 views across platforms, inquiries from potential clients have been pouring into my inbox, hundreds of people have liked and/or subscribed to our Youtube and FB pages, and artists across India have expressed interest in our services.
And that’s where you come in!
I need enough startup capital to launch the musical careers of 10 ARTISTS IN 2015!
By backing this company, you are not only going to receive great rewards like limited edition cds or participate in live recording sessions, you are helping this dream come to life. 
LET'S START A REVOLUTION.
HOW AM I GOING TO PULL THIS OFF and WHY?
During my time spent in India (for the past 6 years) I have personally seen a huge upswing in the number of music schools that have popped up all over the country. This development is parallel to the dramatic growth of the Indian middle class over the last decade.  The BBC predicts that the Indian middle class will reach an astonishing 475 million by 2030.  
Information from BBC.CO.UK
Simultaneously, the number of young people that are choosing music as a career path is increasing every year.  With that said, where are these youth supposed to go after their education? 
Currently:
There are exponentially more musicians than there are professional avenues to take or infrastructure in place for artists to consider•  Bollywood-oriented record label giants like SONY and T Series are hardly interested in independent music and rarely take the time and money to represent and nurture indie artists.
There are only a handful of theatre companies to aspire to get into - most of them unpaid.
There are hardly any venues or theaters that showcase indie artists.  In fact, there are astonishingly fewer performance venues than there are performers.
Getting a job in music after college is extremely rare. Most people drop out of the music business and choose a more ""stable"" profession - even the most gifted musicians.
SO WHAT IS THE ANSWER?
DME!  Desi Music Entertainment will provide talented musicians a legitimate avenue to take after graduating from music school that will promote their music worldwide and set them on the right track. 
Step 1: Our team will offer workshops to music colleges, universities, and conservatories across the country as a supplementary program that focuses on music marketing, promotion, PR, social media marketing, image, and public identity.
Step 2: Students will continue on to the production of their work including recording, programming, mixing and mastering of their single or album.  This package includes production of a music video as well.  This includes digital distribution and live gigs.
Step 3: DME Is tying up with San Francisco Bay Area startup MODERN BEATS which focuses on concert series' that promotes Indian artists.  The clients who achieve an exceptional amount of views or engagement may have the opportunity to perform in the US through Modern Beats.  *Conditions apply
DME PREMIERE
Artists who are already well-known in the Hollywood, Bollywood and Kollywood industries will be featured and promoted through DME PREMIERE. All artists, big or small deserve to be represented! 
Solidarity Song - watch it here!

611,1622405389,"It's pretty simple really. I would like to publish a young adult short story on Amazon Kindle and I need help with the funds to cover the cost of a cover illustration. Cover illustrations are important when it comes to attracting readers. I have found a very talented illustrator who can create a compelling cover for my short story ""Pimples and Puppies.""
What is my short story about, you ask? Well, this is a young adult short story with the theme of learning to be more understanding of others. Something that seems to be in short supply among adults these days. I wrote it in 2014 and it was published on the Alfie Dog Fiction site for a couple of years; however, I did not promote it at that time. Now I would like to get it published to generate interest and a following for its future expansion into a novella. 
Having had pets all my life, I know the power of their love and companionship. They can bring out the best in people and they can bring people together. In the short story and in the novella to follow, three characters who go to the same school but do not run in the same social circles come to find common ground and a better understanding of one another through their love of dogs. Pets make our lives better with their loving spirits, and our appreciation and love of them in turn brings out the best in us. 
With the short story and the novella to follow, the P & P project, I will share characters striving to be better humans with the help of their furry friends. 
Campaign ends Friday, March 23rd.

612,32066693,"A while back in 2008-09 I started visiting forums, I was new in this world by that time. Then I got kicked out for 6 months and from that experience was born a new journey for me. I started my own Forum.
It is really tough to start a new forum without much money to back it up. 
I got into creating mods for vBulletin, I was fascinated with an idea to bringing together users from many forums since I had accounts in many forums and friends on each of them, then I wanted to create a medium point where we could hang out and at the same time, I wanted to help other forum owners to overcome with the problems that new forum faces (lack of active users) 
I did proof of concept (at least to myself) that IT IS possible. Here in this thread: http://www.vbulletin.org/forum/showthread.php?t=219697
I didn't have a clear idea on what to do next. I got up to 11 forums using my mod, I was getting a LOT of traffic to my site by that time (One Million Forum Profiles)  and I was alone coding the entire project. I got burned out due to many request for improving the idea and with no money to pay to other programmers to help me. I was like 48 hours in front of the computer.
It was for me a tough but a great achievement. I did implement it and many people liked the concept. 
Now, about 7 years later, I am working in a kind of the same concept, but with fully functional idea to solve REAL problems for Internet Users, websites, blogs and forums. And I am talking about spam all over websites and lack of reputation across websites.
This service is free for use on blogs, forums, websites, apps etc... And they  would die to use it as the best anti-spam tool ever.
Another real good point about our system for websites, blogs and forums, Any NonFakeUser member would be able to help you to report spam withing your forum or blogs without needing to be a member of your website. This is what i call a truly self cleaning environment. (this would be an optional tool at your disposal) Imagine a collaborating environment like this ;) 
There are other solutions like reCAPTCHA, StopForumSpam and others, but NON of them are capable of fixing the real problem(HUMAN SPAMMERS) There is a huge market for our product/service Almost every blog or forum would use our api.
NonFakeUsers.com will address to prevent spam by 99.9% with a free to use API.
In Other words. There is NOT an existing System yet that addresses those problems with a 99.9% success rate as we plan to do.
NonFakeUsers API
Developers would be able to build new applications, plugins,  mods, products and services on top of our system
And very important. We will not be dealing with private data other than your email.
On top of that, we got on paper and well planned the first Global Reputation System that will revolutionize how people trade/buy/sell all over the internet (a system kind of the one of ebay, but they still get short)
Where is the Money?
Where Is The Money?
But ""nada"" of this can be done without funds, I encourage you to help this project to come to life in the name of ALL internet Users like you and me. 
Sincerely...

My name is Kyle T. Hardin. I am a proud Orlando resident who loves how my city turns upside-down for every holiday. Halloween, though; will always be my favorite.  Believe it or not, I used to hate all things spooky and scary. Going to haunt events like Howl-O-Scream and Halloween Horror Nights started to change the way I saw horror. Many years later it is what I live and breathe every day. With the world hurting from Covid-19, it seemed Halloween was going to take a hard hit... and it did. 
I decided with the cancellation of so many Halloween offerings; I need to create my own! I always go all out decorating the inside of my house but this project is so far from anything I've ever done. I have designed a full entertainment experience! This isn't just a haunted house- this is something super unique and I can't wait to bring it to fruition! 
Things aren't easy for anyone right now, I know that. But amidst the chaos we could all use a little more of things we love. So if you are like me, and crave a haunted experience each Fall, than I would love for you to consider helping support this project. I have SO MANY ideas that I am so excited to work on. I will also make sure the event is as safe as possible. We will have only private groups, extensive post-group cleaning, and socially distant scares. Additionally; any supporter will be able to come and experience the haunt in person when it opens. I hope it'll make you proud!
The P.R.I.D.E Experience
I have worked with friends and family to conceptualize an 8-scene haunted house I will construct in my own home. The plan is to build full walls to create a path for the guests. In a completely focused and creative eye we hope to transport you through incredibly detailed environments. A haunted mansion to a dollhouse to a graveyard... We can't wait to use the support from you all to create and present The P.R.I.D.E. Experience:
You have been invited to a top secret, first of its kind journey into a new world. P.R.I.D.E. is the Practice and Research of Inter-Dimensional Exploration. Our team has found a new tear in the rift located in the living room of an Orlando man's home. After years of exploring the many worlds that have opened up through this portal we are ready to bring in our curious supporters. We will make sure you are safe and prepared for all the wonders and challenges these world hold This will be an exclusive event held only for those invited by P.R.I.D.E. Will that be you? Will you join the exploration and step into the unknown?

I'll start with a quick introduction.

My name is David Beverley, and I'm an indie filmmaker. Over the last few years I have worked my way through a number of short films/online commercials. I've worked as a runner/camera operator/producer and now fortunately as a producer/director.
 As of right now, I'm half way through the shoot on my new romance/horror short called 'Catherine'.  
'Catherine tells the beautiful yet tragic story about how a young woman has driven herself into the ground struggling to keep her dark past a secret from the world and how she must now set aside all she has known to fight and keep the man she has fallen in love with. But can she keep her past away from him?'"

Over these last few years, I've taken a variety of classes, traveled around the world, and gained work experience through a number of different positions, and am ready to start on this incredible project that I feel so passionate about- ""She Is..."" a mock magazine for Kate Spade New York.
Kate Spade New York is a lifestyle brand through and through, and it only makes sense to have a source of inspiration for those who love the brand as much as I do where they can see everything the brand is inspired by, as well as tips, tricks, and ideas that can help them to live life the Kate Spade way.
This is where the birthplace for this project comes in. Enter ""She Is..."", a full lifestyle magazine dedicated to showing off every aspect of the lifestyle Kate Spade exudes. Filled to the brim with beautiful imagery, inspiring articles, and new ideas, this magazine serves to inspire those who read it, and to make life just a bit more colorful. The name is based off of two things- first being the famous phrase ""She is quick, curious, playful, and strong"" that Kate Spade lives by, as well as the latest coffee table book, ""She"", which showcases women from throughout history that have inspired us and made a lasting impact on the world.
The Kate Spade girl is fearless, is always prepared for a dinner party, and never leaves the house without at least a hint of sparkle. She is bold, witty, classic, and feminine. She isn't defined by her age or race, and she certainly doesn't take ""no"" as an answer. This magazine is for the Kate Spade girl, and those who identify with the brand and the message to ""Live Colorfully"" and ""Share Joy"".
This is where I need YOUR help! I have about 6 weeks to make this crazy dream a reality, and I am so excited to collaborate with some incredible people to make this all come to life. 
I intend on doing multiple photo shoots with product, as well as featuring a few ads for companies that Kate Spade relates to within the magazine. Most of this project will be a collaborative effort, and making sure I have the funds available to secure the right props, feed my crew while on set, travel to locations as needed, and ensure proper printing quality for the physical editions are crucial to creating this project.
Thank you so much for taking the time to read through this! I am so excited to get started, and I truly thank you for your support."

In 2018 I bought a coloring book from Magnus Fredriksen, and the illustrations within blew me away. I was unable to color the pages because I was too worried about ruining something so beautiful. I therefore decided to make my own. 
It was late 2018 when I began work on my first coloring book, which used photos from disc golf tournaments I had taken over the years. It was a huge success and was sold to many disc golf stores around the country. With that project completed, I wanted to move onto a new subject dear to me. 
Since I caught the photography bug, I've been taking countless portraits of the many interesting and exciting people I see walking the streets of the different Tampa Bay cities I frequent using my Olympus E-M5. These illustrations are all made from original photos. I wanted to honor these peoples' aesthetics in a coloring book so that all the exciting colors they wear can be further explored and varied.
At the time of writing this, I've completed 31 pages, six of which are activities. I have another 10 photos I want to include as illustrations. I intend the book to have at least 30 pages, but it looks like it will have 40-50 before this kickstarter project is over. I will keep my camera at the ready until the book is sent off to the printer in case anyone else catches my attention.
To create the illustrations, I'm using a combination of Autodesk Sketchbook, Clip Studio Pro, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Indesign.
Once the kickstarter project ends, a survey will be sent out to collect your mailing addresses. The digital copy will be sent via a google drive link.
Chain Assembly, the brand I use for all of my art, illustrations, and graphic design, is an entity that I've been nurturing since 2016. Through it I've designed many logos, I've become a stable source of custom illustrations and design for the Florida Disc Golf Scene, and I've shown in many galleries and museums throughout the United States. You can follow Chain Assembly @Chainassembly on Instagram, Facebook, and at www.chainassembly.com
Thank you for looking at this project and helping me to get it into your hands.

619,2032447566,"New York in Quarantine – a photo book for charity
When NYC emerged as a pandemic hotbed, rooftops became our only respite from cramped apartments; our only escape into the outside world. Since the beginning of quarantine, I have spent hundreds of hours photographing the rise of roof culture from my rooftop in Bushwick, Brooklyn.
I'm creating New York in Quarantine to memorialize the hope, beauty, and eccentricity of New Yorkers persevering through this difficult moment in history. This will be a 96-page, 9x12"" photo book with over 70 images and several essays chronicling the unique rooftop microcosm through quarantine.
Every building has a different journey to its rooftop. Some have swanky elevators with ‘roof deck’ buttons while others have rickety fire escape ladders. Even for the most perilous ascents, I’ve seen elaborate barbecues – grill and all – hauled up via graceful assembly line.
The writing in this book includes detailed, anthropological reflections on rooftop culture, observing and speculating on how my neighbors adapted to an intensive quarantine. I recount the heartwarming stories of socially distanced playdates, cross-rooftop flirtation, makeshift drag show runways, rooftop concerts, and so much more.
This project is a memento to my local community for entrusting me with documenting their lives through the pandemic. It also became the excuse I've always wanted to befriend my neighbors. While this photo series is 95% candid moments, I've gotten to know almost everyone photographed and have received permission to include their images in this book.
Fire escapes are the urban backyard and a defining architectural feature of NYC. If you’re lucky enough to have one, it’s probably your only private (but not secluded) outdoor space. While space is limited, New Yorkers make them work as dining rooms, reading nooks, art studios, and even drag show runways.
Here’s a look at the latest mockup for the table of contents.
100% of profits go to Doctors Without Borders 
To help raise funds to fight COVID-19 in the places that need them most, I'll be donating 100% of profits to Doctors Without Borders (Médecins Sans Frontières), whose work includes fighting COVID-19 through providing humanitarian medical care, medical training, and emergency response services in destabilized regions worldwide.
As per Kickstarter guidelines, which state that projects can't raise funds directly for charity, all contributions will be put towards designing, printing, and distributing this book. The profits from all post-Kickstarter book sales will then go directly to Doctors Without Borders.
To be 100% clear, I will personally be making no money from this project.
Marco was weeks away from opening his first restaurant when the pandemic struck, resulting in the prohibition of indoor dining. Despite the setback, Marco found countless moments of joy on his rooftop, flying kites, playing tag, and joyously twirling his dog and daughter in the air. Marco’s restaurant, The Royal Seafood Bar, is now open with outdoor dining and delivery.
 Projected to Ship by January 
The photo book is nearly completed. The entire series has been shot, edited, and laid out with the creative touch of talented designer Eddy Ymeri. Printing and distribution have already been arranged, and a final draft will be submitted to the printer by early November. Barring any production issues, the books will be shipping out to Kickstarter backers by January.
New York in Quarantine will be printed and bound in the U.S.
Many neighbors made a ritual of coming outside for the 7pm city-wide clap for front-line workers. On most nights, they would linger to appreciate the sunset over the city skyline.
People always want to be higher, climbing onto chimney tops, AC units, and staircase shafts for no apparent reason. It could be a simple thrill, a playful balancing act, or an extra layer of privacy from neighbors below. However, I like to think that this reflects New Yorkers’ simple desire to rise to the top.
 The Photographer 
Josh Katz is a photographer, photography teacher, and sponsored skateboarder living in Brooklyn, NY. He creates digital photography courses, leads workshops and makes videos for Canon, teaches Lightroom for Adobe, and shoots YouTube videos about photography. 
He has large audiences on YouTube and Instagram, which he’ll be leveraging to promote the photo book.
This video shares a behind-the-scenes look at his photographic process for this project, including the ethics of rooftop photography, his relationship with neighbors, and how he suspect quarantine changed New Yorkers' relationships with their rooftops.

Stretch Goal 1: $20,000 [accomplished]
Purpose: The printer will achieve economies of scale, saving an extra $4 on every single book printed. This means thousands more dollars to donate to Doctors Without Borders!
Reward: Everyone who’s preordered a book will get an extra set of three postcards with my favorite images from the project.
 Stretch Goal 2: $30,000 [accomplished]
Purpose: If we can successfully get this book carried by major bookstores and popular retailers, we'll raise tens of thousands more for Doctors Without Borders than initially anticipated! The bigger the splash this campaign makes, the more interest we pique with distributors, wholesalers, and retailers.
Reward: Since this push is all about raising more money for charity, the extra reward you’ll receive is that warm feeling in your heart for helping make a difference.
Share this project on your Instagram story, email it to your family, or brow-beat your NYC-obsessed friends into preordering a copy. Every last bit makes a difference. Thank you for your unwavering support!
In a neighborhood full of transience, the few remaining pigeon coops found on Bushwick rooftops serve as a relic of old New York. I befriended this pigeon fancier who flies his 1,000 birds every day, rain or shine; he claims to love them more than his wife."
620,470447652,"Six years ago, we joined this amazing community and you helped us launch our first collection of literary inspired t-shirts.  It’s been an incredible journey, requiring a lot of hard work and even more caffeine. We're the same team you've gotten to know over three previous campaigns, and we have something totally new to share with you!
We’ve been obsessed with cold brew for almost a decade now — even back when most cafes only served “iced coffee.” Despite our love for cold brew, we don't love the 10 minute walk to Starbucks, waiting another 10 minutes in line, and paying over $4 a cup. It's 2018! We can buy a mattress online. Why are we still drinking cold brew the old way? 
So, we took a step back and decided to imagine the perfect cold brew experience from the ground up. It would be a beautiful, effortless online experience where you could order high quality cold brew directly to your door, on your own schedule. It would be the tastiest, most convenient cold brew you've ever had.
We're back on Kickstarter because we need your help to fund our initial production run and bring Canary Cold Brew to life. We can't wait to get started, as each morning is a reminder of how much we personally want Canary in our own lives — and we think you might, too! 
We've collaborated with dozens of industry experts to create a variety of incredible cold brew blends.  It all starts with organic, fair trade beans.  Next, the beans are roasted to perfection — light enough to bring out the bean's natural flavors, but just dark enough to give you a smooth and chocolatey taste that lingers after the initial kick. After that, we use techniques like nanoscale filtration in our brewing process to bring out all the right notes. The end result is a smooth, pure, high-quality coffee.
We're also excited to be able to produce in small batches, so that we can continually innovate with specialty beans from around the world to create new blends for you. And by being a part of our early process, you'll be able to shape the future of your coffee by sending us detailed feedback on what you'd like to see in our next blends. By backing us now, you’ll be able to play a major role in creating the perfect cold brew blends.  
We've thought long and hard about how to use 21st century technology to bring our ideal coffee routine to life.  Here's what it can mean for you:
Fair Weather Fan.  Maybe you’re a “summer-only” cold brew drinker. We happen to drink it year round, but we want you to have a delivery schedule that caters to you — so you can set it and forget it. We'll even send you an email alert the week before the first 70 degree day in your city or town so your fridge is ready to go for cold brew season.  
Get Back on Track. If you've been a little bit too generous in sharing your Canary with friends, you can have us send your next shipment ahead of schedule to make sure you don't run out. 
Pause Your Subscription.  Easily pause your subscription so nothing piles up while you’re on vacation. We won't give you more cold brew than you want — we'll tailor the experience to fit your exact needs. 
Mixing and Matching. Try new blends in your box. You’ve got your go-to Original Blend for mornings, but you’d like to try something new, too?  No problem!
Design New Blends. Because we produce in small batches, we're so excited to let our customers help us refine our formulas, experiment with new beans, and create new blends. We can't wait to see what you come up with.
Afternoon Blend. One thing we've heard in conversation is, “I love cold brew, but it's too much caffeine for me.”  We're incredibly excited to be launching with our Afternoon Blend, which has about half the caffeine as our original blend. We think it's perfect for a refreshing afternoon iced coffee that gives you a nice pick-me-up without keeping you awake all night. It's the same refreshing cold brew — without the jitters. 
Life's hard. Your cold brew should be easy.  "
621,1863165126,"On the east edge of Round Lake Beach, the old Super Pawn has sat empty for well over a year.  In that time, Black Lung Brewing has been an Alternating Proprietorship.  We were brewing in a shared space and distributing beer around the Chicago Suburbs, while looking for a home of our own.  It only makes sense that we would wind up back in Round Lake Beach, IL., where owners Josh & Sarah Grubbs started their family, lived and worked for a decade.  The old space is getting a new lease on life as we bring over our 5 bbl brew house and creative beer brewing ideas for a new brewery and taproom experience, in a town that greatly deserves it!  We plan to promote a fun craft beer atmosphere, where patrons will enjoy a plethora of worldly beers and some new home town favorites.  We will open a taproom where craft beer enthusiasts can learn about the craft of brewing and see some of the works in progress, while they enjoy a hand crafted brew, made with quality ingredients.  Beer, Grounded in Tradition, Inspired by Enthusiasm.  

Our journey started in a garage with a turkey burner, we are now in 50 retail locations! Help us get to the finish line on our new taproom!

Our goal is to raise a minimum of $15,000 in just a little over 6 weeks (by Dec 21st). So of course, we can’t do this without you! The way Kickstarter works is all or nothing. In order for us to receive the money we raise (and for you to get the awesome rewards we're offering), we MUST meet our goal.

Josh and Sarah started this brewery journey back in 2016. Sarah came up with the name, which comes from a song called Black Lung Heartache. It is reminiscent of the story of Josh's Grandpa, William Grubbs Sr.
The Brewmaster
Joshua Grubbs has had over 20 years in construction and the last five years homebrewing.  He has attended the Concise Course in Brewing at Siebel Institute, volunteered at local breweries and distributed his beer for a year.  Josh loves the delicacy of traditional beers and the inventiveness of newer styles.  He is an award winning homebrewer and is eager to serve his award winning brews in a taproom of his own.  Can't wait to see you in the taproom!

The Eight Six Five looks to incorporate all the previous experiences, in addition to my general penchant for a lot of geekiness, and wrap them into a site devoted to Knoxville. We'll have a monthly podcast that will be a roundtable discussion on our fair city, we'll be sponsoring different First Friday galleries, and we'll be reporting on all things Knoxville. Currently, there are 17 folks that have offered to help out and write. I hope to have a new article every day of the work week (Monday-Friday), covering a multitude of subjects ranging from art to music to concerts to non-profits to transfers to wellness to DIY'ers to pets to community awareness to etc to etc to etc. Also aim to have at least one video feature month. The goal of the site is to marry great article content to good photography.
All money donated will be accounted for on the website, at a special link, where any one who donates can see how I spend every dime. My intention is not to make any money with this site. Anything sold (as in t-shirts) I plan on taking the money from that, picking a local non-profit, and donating the full amount.
The podcasting equipment, hosting and other fees are what's making me reach out to the community. Originally I was going to fund all aspects, but had many a friend saying they'd like to pitch in. Kickstarter is a great format to help bring folks together. Which is, at it's core, what The Eight Six Five is all about."

From graphic design to architectural illustrator to animator to concept art for video games and so on... all the while oil painting has been my passion. I love making marks with a brush! Stranger in a strange land, dark traveler, detectives, noir type occult work, one man against the odds, unlikely heroes - these are all themes that have interested me over the years. NOMADS will be filled with these ideas!
NOMADS is a collection of conceptual, character driven paintings, that were started as a way to realize and drive out a narrative for further storytelling projects. As the paintings were developed they eventually became known as ""NOMADS"" and as each painting was explored, they in turn helped to further define a story and characters for a graphic novel as well. (currently being worked on for a future release!) The NOMADS art book will be a limited run, 7""x7"" 40 page hardcover book.

625,202399276,"The Opportunity Presents Itself...
MIguel has landed a position at a winery where he manages all winemaking operations for various clients around Monterey County. The owner of this facility has been overly generous enough to allow Miguel the opportunity to create his own brand and utilize the equipment and space that is already in existence. Being the type of person that seeks a new adventure, Miguel has seized the moment and has began the process of becoming an established winery. Never having thought that this day would come so soon in his life, non-the-less, Miguel is ready to take on any challenges that are faced with owning a business.
The Plan...
Over the past seven months, Miguel has been filing for and obtaining all necessary permits and licenses legally required for operating a winery. The gears of this mechanism have been quietly turning, and all has finally been acquired. It has been a long and costly process, from the paperwork to the barrels needed to make wine. Currently, a few local restaurants have shown interest in carrying the Lepe Cellars brand and a website is in the works where those seeking to purchase can place their orders online. Everything is at his fingertips to make this dream a reality, but he still needs the help and support of friends, family and everyone else to aid in the production of the first major vintage. In the past, Miguel has been making small batches of wine, but the time has now come to make a bigger push to enter the market place and to satisfy the demand.
What Is Kickstarter?
Kickstarter is a new way to fund projects. Everyone using Kickstarter has complete control and responsibility over their project and at no given point is kIckstarter invloved with the development of a project. Project creators (Miguel) set a funding goal ($8,000) and deadline. If people like a project, they can pledge money to make it happen. Funding on Kickstarter is all-or-nothing — projects must reach their funding goals to receive any money. All-or-nothing funding might seem scary, but it’s amazingly effective in creating momentum and rallying people around an idea. To date, an impressive 44% of projects have reached their funding goals. Project creators also offer rewards to thank backers for their support. Ultimately, Kickstarter is only a tool to spread the word and Miguel will always and forever have 100% ownership of this project.
The Reason For Kickstarting...
Miguel's Kickstarter project is aiding in his financial need. Up until now, his funds have gone towards paying for the licenses and permits, legal fees, supplies, and taxes. And with the 2015 harvest coming up, he need's assistance in purchasing grapes to make the Lepe Cellars brand a reality. So why $8,000? This would allow for the purchase of enough grapes to produce a significant amount of wine to enter the local markets around Monterey County.
Your support for this endeavor is truly and greatly appreciated! As a friend and supporter, you will forever be rewarded with Lepe Cellars benefits. And for those that cannot visit the winery due to distance or time constraints, rewards can be negotiable."

ENTERTAINING, WITH A TOUCH OF MORALE...
Whilst touching on various financial scams, crises and some other negative side effects that have resulted from finance, the book is mainly aimed to be entertaining, not moralising. Some real financial ‘fairy tales’ have become innovations that have made dreams come true, whilst others have remained castles in the sky.
However, as noted by the author of the foreword - a pioneer of the international hedge fund industry - I hope the stories will also be considered instructive.
Erik Vrij has spent a career that spans both finance and fiction. He has the knowledge and imagination to bring these two strange worlds together in a way that is both instructive and fun to read. Anyone reading his stories and thinks they are made up by the power of imagination will be surprised to know that they are well founded in reality and made accessible and enjoyable in the hands of a master story teller.

I am a Dutch finance lawyer, based in Abu Dhabi, with 22 years of experience in international banking and investment management with global banks, covering all finance activities included in the fairy tales: lending, structured finance, corporate finance, investment management, trade finance, financial engineering, fintech, payments, cash management, compliance, risk management, savings and more. 
Editor and writer of diverse publications and articles
Apart from being a lawyer, I have a passion for writing, editing and publishing. During the past 25 years I have written, edited, founded and published a diverse range of publications, a number of which have been published by some of the most reputable publishers. They include an international law journal, a guide to legal studies in Europe, a travel guide, poetry, an alumni member directory and quarterly magazine, articles on (finance) law, newsletter articles, a horoscope and a business thriller.
Sources of inspiration
I have had diverse sources of inspiration for writing, finance and fairy tales. My picturesque Netherlands home town Bergen (NH) has been the home of many famous authors and artists (https://bergenaanzee.com/kunst-cultuur). My wife Brigitte and I have a habit of watching Czech fairy tales traditionally broadcasted in her original home country for Christmas, filled with kings, castles, princesses, white horses and bad guys. 
Being passionate about the Arab world after having travelled to the region and worked with clients in the region, I moved to work in Abu Dhabi early 2018, about 1001 (Arabian) nights ago. I have been living in one of the five beautiful skyscrapers of Etihad Towers, overlooking two of the most magic palaces imaginable, Emirates Palaces and the UAE Presidential Palace, Qasr al Watan (which has an exhibition with the 1001 Arabian Nights included). Combined with work in the finance sector it was easy to be inspired to write a collection of financial fairy tales. With help of Emirati and other regional friends and colleagues I was able to create a true Arabian publication project. 
It is hard not to be inspired by this view from my window

The Marken Thriller Express, a tour to the locations of the book
Inspired by tourist trips organised to Dan Brown's book locations in Florence and Rome, I wrote a travel guide to the book's Dutch location, Marken, one of the country's top tourist destinations, visited by over 300,000 tourists each year by ferry of the Volendam Marken Express. In the book (set in 2028) this pictureques folkloric peninsula has become a tax haven European rights management centre with skyscrapers, nicknamed MARKHATTAN. 
I organised a special tour package with the Volendam Marken Express ferry service and Volendam Events including a book and the travel guide. Unfortunately an invisible skyline and legal thriller was not what most tourist came for...

WHO SHOULD READ AND BACK THIS BOOK PROJECT?
The book is aimed at anyone working in the finance industry around the world or who wants to surprise anyone in the finance industry with a unique present.
The fairy tales include roles of coverage bankers, investment bankers, central bankers, regulators, stock brokers, investment managers, CFOs, CEOs, payments, credit cards and cash managers, fintech staff, trade financiers, insurers, compliance officers, lawyers, accountants, borrowers, financial engineers, tax lawyers, risk managers, tellers, financial back office staff and more.
The fairy tales have not been written in a way that requires much technical knowledge, but inevitably some knowledge of the business, jargon, nature and relevant issues is required to fully understand some of them.
A UNIQUE AND FUN BESPOKE (RELATIONSHIP) GIFT
This book is one of a kind. Everyone grew up with some of the fairy tales on which these stories are based, but financial fairy tales have never been written like this before. I have not found anything similar on Google.
Surprise yourself and anyone in your family and network of friends, colleagues, team members, staff, company who is active in finance. Bring out their childhood memories and entertain them with something original and unexpected which they can relate to: fairy tales in a financial setting. As a unique bonus, surprise them by having their name included in the credits section of the book. Who doesn’t want to have a book on the bookshelf with his or her name in it? And don’t worry, this is all as affordable as buying a book in the bookstore.
If you have slightly deeper pockets or a (corporate) budget, consider surprising a larger group of finance professionals by pre-ordering more books at a discount: your team, company, all clients etc. You can include all of their names in the book with a personal printed and/or handwritten message from you and me. You may especially make use of some personalisation options. Consider having a dust jacket (paper wrap around cover) and/or bookmark with your logo, company building photo and a message by you and a photo of you on the back cover, conveying that important (thank you) message to your staff, family, clients or other important persons you want to put in the spotlight. It may even include a bespoke short fairy tale. For Christmas 2020 or any other important occasion. Check out the rewards section. 
A cover or bookmark with your logo, short fairy tale, thank you message, birthday wish: anything!
If you want to go out of your way for that special person, give a fairy tale character his or her name. This is a very exclusive (only two available) and more expensive reward: don’t wait too long!
Last but not least, if you are ready, willing and able (in Covid times) to travel to Abu Dhabi: every book includes an invitation to the book presentation in Abu Dhabi, in December 2020. Another book presentation may be organised in the Netherlands."

  More About The Author
I am a British photographer with a focus on dramatic landscape and architectural urban work. The style of my photography is a mix of painterly emotions with key inspirations from films and historic cultures. This originally started out with the production of my large wall pieces, but has progressively adapted into portraiture and fashion photography.
My love for landscape photography itself began in 2011, when I visited Nepal. Experiencing an overwhelming explosion of culture, architecture and the largest landscapes imaginable. It turned my view of the world upside down and put me on the path of creation.
I run one of the worlds largest photography blogs with readers from 60+ countries per week and followed by 230,000 people. Social media continues to be instrumental in marketing my photography and is always bringing me opportunities to work with companies from around the world.

I hope to travel to every continent so capture the beauty of not only manmade architecture but also natural as well."
636,302556197,"The vision for this project is the establishment of a women-owned and operated craft brewery in Kigali, Rwanda.
Josephine ""Fina"" Uwineza
At the heart of the Rwanda Craft Brewery Project is owner Josephine ""Fina"" Uwineza, a Rwandan woman who is no stranger to entrepreneurship. Uwineza is a successful restaurateur in Rwanda’s capital city of Kigali, where she opened the city’s first-ever Chinese restaurant. It became a go-to destination for tourists and the embassy crowd, and at one time, between her two popular restaurants, she had more than 50 staff employed.
Nancy Coldham
More recently Uwineza shared a business idea with Nancy Coldham, a Toronto-based consultant who has traveled to and worked extensively in Rwanda as a mentor to women entrepreneurs. The connection with Coldham sparked an idea for a Canadian-inspired craft brewery in Rwanda. Coldham reached out to the Ontario Craft Brewers association on behalf of Uwineza, who in turn connected the women with Beau’s All Natural Brewing Co, of Vankleek Hill, Ontario, Canada. 
Group [L-R] Beau’s CEO Steve Beauchesne, Rwandan entrepreneur Fina Uwineza, Beau’s CFO Tanya Beimers, Beau’s Creative Director Jordan Bamforth, photo credit Brendan Coutts
Following several months of teleconferences and emails, a team from Beau’s that included CEO Steve Beauchesne and CFO Tanya Beimers travelled to Rwanda to meet Uwineza in person and get a sense of the scope of the project, as well as some of the specific challenges associated with it. The team also met with officials from the city of Kigali as well as the Republic of Rwanda, and were offered a warm welcome and assistance to help get Uwineza’s Rwanda Craft Brewery Project off the ground.
Christian Riemerschmid von der Heide
Next, Beauchesne and Beimers appealed to equipment suppliers on behalf of the Rwanda Craft Brewery Project to see if special funding considerations were a possibility. Their requests brought the donation of a brewhouse from BC-based Newlands Systems Inc. (NSI). Their COO, Christian Riemerschmid von der Heide, has experience brewing in Africa and has additionally joined the project to assist and consult. The brewhouse would be gifted by NSI as a team effort by their employees through donated time from fabricators, engineers, and brewing staff. It will be purpose-built for the Rwanda Craft Brewery Project.
And now, Eastern Ontario craft brewery Beau’s All Natural is launching this Kickstarter to help Uwineza start the brewery. For their part, Beau’s will also be providing financing, expertise, and hands-on employee training to the start-up brewery. Beau’s co-founder Steve Beauchesne is careful to point out that no profits from the new brewery will flow back to Beau’s or to the other partners.
Craft beer has become a very successful industry in Canada, and since Rwandans drink as much beer as Canadians, this industry would make a positive contribution to the Rwandan business community. The craft brewing industry is taking root in Africa in countries such as Kenya, Botswana and South Africa (with 135 microbrewers) and we believe it is the perfect time for a Rwandan national beer. 
The next steps of the Rwanda Craft Brewery Project requires $95,000 in funding to purchase a bottling line.
Fina, Nancy, as well as the teams at Beau's and NSI, are now asking for your support in bringing Fina's dream to life! Help us by donating to support the Rwanda Craft Brewery Project."

Many people of color have fought and died for this country. Only for many men and their stories to fall in obscurity. The 369th regiment of the rainbow brigade, the Harlem Rattler's as known by their regimental name. This distinguished army group was a monumental force, a story of heroism rarely revealed today. Would be known by their foes as the Hellfighters. For their unrelenting fighting capabilities and prevailing values. From the beginning, this regiment and many others like it faced many trials and tribulations. The war would continue to be at large, fighting racism at their own home front among it's own nation and the other abroad against Europe in France. As told by the war department in the year 1917 ""that black was not a color in the rainbow"" had since endured the mountainous adversity to be overcame. Known as the Great War, WWI the French would attribute it's success's.  Based on the 369th regiment of the 93rd division of the 15th infantry. 
Why Kickstarter? 

I am a navy veteran and have served amongst the ranks of my fellow servicemen and women. I have long heard a story about an all black regiment known as the Harlem Hellfighters. Who fought during the Great War. And had little recognition for their feats they accomplished. Many of them passed after the war due to the battle within their minds. The one's back at home and the war on the frontlines. Torrential turmoil by those of it's own nation, hanged or shot down in cold blood for wearing their uniforms. As well as judged by the color of their skin. These brave soldiers gave their lives for its country. But they in return, received nothing. We have compiled and have diligently researched this story and would love to tell it to the world. And to make a pilot is what our ultimate vision and goal is. And we would love it if you could contribute and help us reveal this dream to everyone else. The script is, compiled and finalized. And we would like help for the necessities of filming, editing, camerawork, videography, actors and permits to finally make it a reality. 
The 369th Regiment 
The Characters
This script and pilot will be based on the historical data from the archives of military history. 

James Europe - an composer and musician who led the first negro band in the army. His band would be known throughout history as one of the best army bands to exist. 

Henry Johnson - a unassuming man from north Carolina. Who moved to Albany, New York with a southern drawl. That would later be known as a hero amongst the division.

We are excited to be returning for a third year. While enjoying last year's con the theme ""A Touch of Evil"" was announced.  All of the things we could do with a second consuite  were running through my mind.  Then it hit me, an Asylum.
The challenges we are facing are making sure we can provide two spectacular,  unique experiences. A few members of our creative team for S.O.London consuite are finding other time constraints.  So, we are looking to the CoreCon community for assistance. 
In the Asylum, we will be offering a look into the history of medical treatment for the ""insane"". Experience wearing a straight jacket. Committ your friends and family or maybe they will admit you. And hopefully a lot more.
As a thank you for being a supporter of this new consuite, we are offering you mock patient files to be enjoyed by con goers,  our caffeinated brownies with or without bacon, and lastly our handmade straight jackets. 
Thank you for your time.  Please continue to enjoy the S.O.L consuite and now we hope to bring you a little... mental health. "

 Etemenanki, Technofantasy Role Playing Game utilizza un sistema originale chiamato ""Systemenanki"" basato sul D20 Under, dove i personaggi sono sempre proattivi in ogni situazione che si pone loro davanti.

Etemenanki,Technofantasy Role Playing Game è ambientato in un mondo cruento e misterioso. Potrai interpretare creature appena giunte su Kronhos dai propri universi attraverso la Soglia dei Mondi, mentre scoprono giorno per giorno la sconfinata ambientazione che si presenta loro. Vedrai un Impero dominato dai non morti, potenti Gilde corrotte e senza scrupoli, battaglie combattute in nome della fede in meschine divinità. Dovrai sopravvivere ai Guardiani del Paradosso e agli ermetici Eterni, o semplicemente non morire di fame in un qualche angolo di una sperduta Strada di Nessuno.
Solo la Shaddakh, la fratellanza verso i tuoi compagni, potrà darti una possibilità di salvezza.

La scelta delle stirpi giocanti è estremamente variegata, dando la possibilità ai giocatori di interpretare personaggi non morti, mezzi angeli, mezzi elementali, mannari, golem e creature biomeccaniche fino ai classici elfi, nani e orchi, ma con le particolarità che queste etnie hanno nel mondo di Etemenanki. 
Nel manuale saranno presentate fino a quaranta stirpi giocanti e, in base al successo del kickstarter, si potrà arrivare a cinquantacinque.  [STRETCH GOAL SBLOCCATO 55/55 STIRPI NEL MANUALE BASE!]
La scelta iniziale delle corporazioni (le classi) sarà di dieci, con una varietà di ruoli tra cui scegliere che andrà dal cavalcadaemoni al templare, fino ad arrivare a venti, in base al supporto che avremo da parte vostra nel progetto. [STRETCH GOAL SBLOCCATO 20/20 CORPORAZIONI NEL MANUALE BASE!]
Potrete padroneggiare dall’alta magia fino alle tecnologie avveniristiche, passando per gli innesti bionici o biogenetici, i simbionti e le armi da fuoco e al laser, in un’ambientazione dove la magia e la scienza si contrastano da migliaia di secoli.
Il Quartiere dei Miracoli, uno dei quartieri della città di Babilonia. Disegno di Silvia Pasqualetto.
Etemenanki, Technofantasy Role Playing Game è stato testato e sviluppato in lunghe campagne di gioco e dalle scelte compiute dalle centinaia di giocatori che hanno vissuto le più grandi leggende di Kronhos, il pianeta su cui si svolgeranno le vostre avventure. Ogni aspetto dell’ambientazione è nato e cresciuto attraverso una solida coerenza narrativa che ha creato uno sviluppo di trama equilibrato e veramente esteso.

Cosa aspetti? Varca le porte della Città Immortale, raisind...

Attraverso la Torre di Etemenanki, entra nella mitica Babilonia, la città dove giungono da ogni luogo e tempo del Cronoverso, l’insieme di tutti gli universi spaziali e temporali, i raisindi (viandanti), portando le loro conoscenze, la loro scienza, i loro dèi, le loro leggende e persino le architetture provenienti dalle loro terre.
Crea la tua Libera Compagnia di avventurieri, la Shaddakh, ed esplora un mondo sconfinato!
Cammina per le vie della Città Immortale, Babilonia, tra i quartieri coperti dall’ombra dell’infinita Torre, dove innumerevoli stirpi diverse si muovono tra loro come tumultuosi fiumi attraverso la più grande metropoli del Cronoverso. Qui potrai vedere, nel Quartiere dei Sapienti, esseri meccanici parlare di filosofia con daemoniti, e pallidi elfi bere in malfamate taverne insieme a insettoidi dai colori sgargianti.
Nel Quartiere dei Mercanti osserverai orchi monocoli dalle quattro braccia contrattare con metavermoidi avidi di denari nelle botteghe e, guardando verso il cielo, vedrai felinoidi cavalcare manticore alate, sfidando scalcinati biplani guidati da folli gremlin. Scruterai rattoidi attendere qualche ignara vittima nel Quartiere di Sotto, tra le tenebre e una lama nascosta, mentre magdum, maghi empi di magia, si scontrano contro inquisitori-scienziati del culto della Realtà a causa di odi primordiali mai sopiti.
Procurarti cibo ed equipaggiamenti resistenti non sarà semplice, e nessuno si meraviglierà vedendoti depredare un nemico per impossessarti dei suoi stivali o di pezzi d’armatura ancora in buono stato.

Molte sono le strade che potrai intraprendere durante le tue avventure:
 Dare la tua fedeltà alle Gilde e accrescere il loro corrotto controllo sul mondo di Kronhos.
 Azzardare al “Gioco del Mastrovingio”, dove aristocratici non morti tramano in palazzi barocchi l’ambizione del potere assoluto.
 Combattere per il Nero Imperatore e la sua Legione di non morti senzienti, oppure contro di esso unendoti alle insorte Città-Stato, o ai postnucleari ribelli delle Lande Perdute della Dannatio, signori delle Macchine Creatomiche corrotte dalla letale Consuntione, la radiazione dell'anti-esistenza.
 Abbracciare fanaticamente la fede nella tua divinità, per poter ambire a divenire un Avatar colmo di fervore durante le sanguinose Feste dei Cento Culti!
 Ricercare l’immortalità attraverso la gloria degli Eterni, ricordandoti che la Guerra Senza Tempo pretende sacrifici, poiché molti dovranno cadere per tua mano nel Labirinto Eterno affinché tu possa vivere per sempre.
 Comprendere le vie del Fato sfuggendo al Clavigero e ai suoi Ancolieri, i custodi dei Cancelli del Tempo per cui tu non sei null’altro che una Fractura da saldare con le Chiavi del Paradosso.
Il Sacro Ordine Templare, i difensori dei Culti di Kronhos
Le avventure che potrai vivere nel mondo di Etemenanki sono innumerevoli! Starà a te scegliere il cammino da percorrere e sempre a te il sopravvivere a esso!
Sii un fulgido eroe, qui dove il bene e il male non esistono, o scegli di essere uno spietato criminale senza scrupoli. Tanto, nessuno è mai completamente innocente agli occhi degli dèi crudeli e implacabili di Kronhos.

Etemenanki, Technofantasy Role Playing Game ha una struttura di regolamento completo per ogni evenienza narrativa. 
""Systemenanki"" è un sistema D20 Under. Le sfide sono divise in Prove di Difficoltà, in cui basterà stare col tiro del dado sotto o pari al valore della caratteristica o abilità utilizzata, e Prove di Contrasto, che risolveranno i conflitti con gli antagonisti, in cui vincerà chi riuscirà a totalizzare il punteggio assoluto migliore tra tutti.
Le armature hanno un valore di corazza che si detrae dai danni subiti, ma, con l'uso delle regole opzionali, avranno anche la possibilità di rompersi, così come le armi, e rendere il recupero degli equipaggiamenti una parte molto interessante del gioco.
Come dicevamo, il sistema è organizzato su diverse regole opzionali per permettere ai giocatori di scegliere la propria esperienza di gioco in base alla profondità dell’applicazione delle stesse. Tra le regole opzionali troverete: la possibilità di portare i colpi in combattimento alle diverse locazioni del corpo, l'utilizzo delle abilità per specializzare maggiormente il personaggio, la rottura degli equipaggiamenti, l'ingombro sul movimento, le malattie da infezione, l'uso dei colpi ardui (critici) e dei colpi ostili (fumble) nel combattimento e anche nell'utilizzo della magia, e diverse altre.
Il manuale base che vi andiamo a proporre sarà completo di tutto il sistema di gioco, comprese le regole opzionali. Starà voi scegliere quali utilizzare!

Le molteplici scelte sulle stirpi e le corporazioni giocabili danno al mondo di Etemenanki una tridimensionalità eccezionale, così come la varietà della magia, dei poteri e delle religioni. Si potrà persino, se lo si vorrà, costruire i personaggi in maniera completamente casuale, in modo che non possano mai esisterne due completamente uguali!
Un Golem meccanico
I personaggi che giocherete sono più forti della media rispetto a quelli creati in un gioco di ruolo classico. Essi appartengono già alle corporazioni, un'elite all'interno delle carriere di Gilda a cui normalmente gli altri abitanti di Kronhos possono ambire.  Ognuno, ha abilità particolari specifiche in modo da renderli molto specializzati nel proprio ruolo. Questo perché l'ambientazione, essendo particolarmente cruenta, necessità di personaggi forti che possano sopravvivere alle mille avversità che incontreranno. 
Le caratteristiche del personaggio influenzano a cascata tutte le parti della scheda rendendo veramente omogenea la parte di comprensione dell'uso di quest'ultima, oltre ad avere un'estetica accattivante dovuta all'ingegno di Luca Martinelli.
Scheda completa con regole opzionali
La risoluzione dei conflitti, dal combattimento al lancio delle magie, al voler convincere un antagonista, al comprendere un inganno o derubare qualcuno, si risolve sempre con Prove di Contrasto in cui ogni partecipante è proattivo nell'azione. Non sarai mai un testimone attonito di quel che succede, ma potrai sempre agire sfruttando le tue risorse di gioco!
La magia funziona attraverso il consumo di una riserva di Punti Mistici per essere utilizzata, questo da molta varietà di scelta immediata nelle azioni dei personaggi con questi ruoli.
Il combattimento può, grazie a regole opzionali a scelta, divenire veramente pericoloso per coloro che ne sono coinvolti, con anche regole opzionali di guarigione e cura avanzate per un maggior realismo applicato al gioco.

Le avventure si possono sviluppare su più livelli, dalla classica one-shot alla vera e propria campagna. Le strutture caratteriali dei personaggi con le limitazioni date da stirpe e corporazione, possono creare diversi contrasti all'interno del gruppo, per visioni diverse che possono andare dall'utilizzo della magia fino alle diatribe religiose. Nelle one-shot questi rendono dinamici i rapporti di Shaddakh, compagnia, mentre nelle campagne daranno ai giocatori la possibilità di crescere e cooperare anche in situazioni sociali difficili, ma che potranno portare all'esaltazione del miglior gioco di squadra.
La crescita del personaggio, attraverso il classico salire di livello grazie all'accumulo di Punti Esperienza, dona, oltre agli avanzamenti di Corporazione, a ogni passaggio un pool di Punti Livello, utilizzabili per poter aumentare i propri valori a scelta, dando piena libertà al giocatore di far eccellere il personaggio dove preferisce.

Si può scegliere di giocare in diversi modi a Etemenanki, Technofantasy Role Playing Game. Starà a tutto il gruppo decidere durante la Sessione 0, prima della creazione dei personaggi, cosa voler fare della vita dei loro eroi.
Potete strutturare diverse campagne di gioco, qui di seguito vi diamo degli esempi generici che saranno spiegati nel dettaglio nel Manuale Base. Potete liberamente mischiarli o crearne voi stessi di nuovi, questi sono solo degli spunti indicativi:
 Campagna Libera, dove i personaggi si muovono attraverso le classiche avventure.
 Campagna di Gilda, dove i personaggi compiono missioni al fine di salire di grado e di potere all'interno della propria gilda, fino a doversi scontrare con i loro maestri e prenderne il posto. Questa campagna è abbastanza semplice per i principianti.
 Campagna Imperiale, dove i personaggi, fedeli all'impero, cercano di far cadere gli insorti e le città ribelli per schiacciarli sotto il giogo di Babilonia.
 Campagna Infiltrati, dove i personaggi, legati alle città ribelli, si infiltrano nell'Impero per cercare di distruggerlo.
 Campagna Eterna, dove i personaggi entrano tra le fila degli Eterni per raggiungere l'immortalità e sconfiggere le genie nemiche.
 Campagna del Paradosso, dove i personaggi sono delle Fracture nella trama del Tempo e dovranno trovare il modo di sopravvivere ai guardiani del Paradosso, muovendosi nel tempo e ricucendo gli strappi temporali che li perseguitano.
Naturalmente, molte campagne possono compenetrarsi o dare spunti tra loro, avete piena libertà di giocare come volete!
All'interno del manuale di Etemenanki, Technofantasy Role Playing Game troverete tutte le indicazioni per aiutare i giocatori a scegliere il tipo di gioco che preferiscono, utilizzando regole opzionali e sistemi di poteri adatti al ruolo che intendono giocare. 
Nell'ambientazione stessa ci saranno diversi paragrafi chiamati spunti, tra le descrizioni generali, che daranno idee narrative per permettere di creare avventure o campagne legate al mondo di Kronhos. La vastità dell'ambientazione permette di giocare ogni luogo o trama in modo immersivo, dando la possibilità di scoprire i misteri e i segreti nascosti in essa dalle orditure del tempo. 

Il progetto Etemenanki ha come obbiettivo il portare, dopo 30 anni di gioco ininterrotto e 2 anni di serrato playtest del regolamento, finalmente alla luce un manuale completo di 420 pagine, stampato e illustrato a colori, con copertina rigida e il cui interno comprende tutto ciò che serve per giocare, gestire le avventure e il gioco e creare i personaggi, oltre al sistema di combattimento, la magia, la tecnologia, gli equipaggiamenti, le divinità, i mostri e la suggestiva ambientazione.

Dalla nascita di Etemenanki come idea embrionale, nel lontano 1987, numerosi sono stati coloro che hanno giocato, amato e arricchito sia l’ambientazione che il sistema regolistico creati entrambi da Antonino Galimi. Ognuno ha lasciato un segno e un ricordo indelebile che si trova tra le pagine di questo manuale, chi con la propria arte, chi con le proprie idee e chi con le proprie capacità nell’interpretare quelli che sono divenuti personaggi e stirpi iconiche del gioco.

Dal 2018 ci siamo decisi a rendere reale questo sogno e abbiamo iniziato a costruire una squadra di artisti, grafici ed editor che potessero supportarci nel compimento dell’opera.
Le quattro Gilde di Babilonia. Mock-up di manuale aperto.
La spettacolare copertina di Federico Musetti da perfettamente l'idea del mondo che vi accingete a visitare. Le illustrazioni di Silvia Pasqualetto aprono tutti i capitoli che compongono il manuale, con tavole a doppia e a singola facciata facendovi tuffare un passo alla volta nell'ambientazione. Gli oltre ottanta ritratti delle stirpi e delle corporazioni di Simone Tavecchio danno una perfetta idea dei personaggi che potete interpretare o incontrare nel mondo di Kronhos. Le illustrazioni dei tarocchi, delle divinità, alcuni disegni interni e i molti simboli grafici di Sabrina Normani, danno quel senso di meraviglia che colpisce chi attraversa la Torre di Etemenanki. Il progetto grafico del manuale, molti ritratti e dei disegni interni creati da Gaja Granata, dimostrano la professionalità che incontrerete quando avrete questo libro tra le mani. Il bestiario curato da Filippo Munegato darà forma ai mostri che popolano le terre di Babilonia. Molti dei simboli grafici creati da Manuel Strali sono parte integrante dell'iconografia dell'ambientazione, il vitruviano babilonese di Matteo Pagliari della scheda, le armi di Paolo Volpi, i disegni di Francesco Gennari, la mappa di Vasco Gioachini, rendono il manuale completo e curato e, senza l'aiuto dell'editor Davide Cencini, non avremmo sicuramente avuto un prodotto così preciso nei minimi particolari.
Menzione d'onore per il coinvolgente video di presentazione realizzato dallo Studio Carabas con la voce narrante di Fabrizio Careddu.

Copertina dell'avventura, disegno di Silvia Pasqualetto
 ""Si narra che il Labirinto Eterno si perda nell'Interstizio, una sorta di demipiano che si sviluppa dentro le mura di Babilonia stessa. Qui vi sono regioni sconfinate, sotterranei, persino città perdute. In questo luogo si smarriscono gli Eterni sconfitti o coloro che non sono degni di appartenere alla loro genia. Solo la follia esiste negli occhi di chi si abbandona in esso e l'unica salvezza ti potrà condannare per sempre alla Guerra Senza Tempo!""

Über CARTA: 
CARTA wurde 2020 mit dem Ziel gegründet, das Umweltbewusstsein aller durch die Kleidung die wir täglich tragen zu stärken. Dabei stehen die Stickmuster von bedrohten und ausgestorbenen Tier- und Pflanzenarten im Mittelpunkt. Durch die Verbindung von nachhaltigen Kleidungsstücken mit digitalen Lösungen wie Computer Vision & Augmented Reality bringen wir durch ""The Story Behind"" die unverwechselbaren Stickmuster zum Leben und helfen euch dabei, die packenden Geschichten hinter den Arten zu erzählen. Unser einzigartiges ""Save our Planet"" Konzept unterstützt zudem Organisation wie das Jane Goodball Institut Deutschland, die bedrohten Arten vor dem Aussterben zu retten.
Philipp & Max von CARTA Clothing
Hallo mein Name ist Philipp, bin 28 Jahre und komme ursprünglich vom Bodensee (dem badischen Teil, was ich auch nicht müde werde zu betonen). Ich spiele unheimlich gerne Tennis und Handball oder gehe in die Berge. Falls es euch interessiert, verrate ich euch woher der Name CARTA kommt und erzähle euch dabei noch eine der schönsten Liebesgeschichten die ihr je gehört habt. Fun Fact: Während meines Bachelors habe ich knapp über 1.000 Bäume eigenhändig gepflanzt ;) 
Und ich bin Max, 29 Jahre alt und gebürtiger Franke, jetzt zuhause in der bayrischen Landeshauptstadt München. Ich bin schon mein Leben lang eng mit unserer Natur verbunden, sei es beim Segeln auf deutschen Seen, den Meeren oder Wandern in den heimischen Bergen. Leider habe ich nicht ganz so viele Bäume wie Philipp gepflanzt, habe aber dafür lange Jahre unter anderem Schafe als Haustiere gehalten ;)
Die CARTA Mode: 
Jedes unsere CARTA Kleidungsstücke hat ein einzigartiges Stickmuster einer ausgestorbenen oder bedrohten Tier- & Pflanzenart. Diese Arten befinden sich im Zentrum unserer Mode. 
CARTA - Mens Fit | Snow White | Alle Stickmuster
CARTA - Stickmuster der bedrohten & ausgestorbenen Arten
Cao-Vit Gibbon (bedroht | Population 47): Der Cao-Vit Gibbon ist eine vom Aussterben bedrohte Primatenart, die im chinesisch-vietnamesischen Grenzgebiet beheimatet ist. Die Männchen haben ein nahezu komplett schwarzes und die Weibchen ein farbenfrohes gelb- bis beigebraunes Fell. Die Ausbreitung des Menschen und die gezielte Jagd auf das Tier haben dazu geführt, dass heute weniger als 50 Exemplare leben. Um den Erhalt der Spezies zu sichern, wurden als erste Maßnahme neue Wälder in China und Vietnam gepflanzt was jedoch bei weitem nicht ausreicht, um die Tiere vor dem Aussterben zu schützen.
Viola Cryana (ausgestorben | 1939): Die Viola Cryana ist eine ausgestorbene Veilchenart, die als Endemit in dem französischen Departement Yvonn heimisch war. Endemiten sind nur in einer bestimmten Region heimisch, wodurch sie sehr anfällig für äußere Einflüsse sind. Die Viola wurde bis zu 12 cm groß und hatte dabei relativ große Blüten in einer hellen, violetten Farbe. Sie wurde erst 1878 wissenschaftlich beschrieben, gilt jedoch bereits seit 1939 als ausgestorben. Der industrielle Kalksteinbergbau zur Zementherstellung hat dazu geführt, dass der begrenzte Lebensraum zerstört wurde. Ohne diesen konnte die Viola Cryana nicht überleben.
Eskimo Curlew (ausgestorben | 1963): Der Eskimo Curlew (Brachvogel) ist eine ausgestorbene Vogelart, die in Kanada und Alaska beheimatet war. Die Vögel nisteten im freien Gelände auf dem Boden und reisten als Zugvögel in den Wintermonaten bis nach Argentinien und Chile. Charakteristisch für den Brachvogel waren die grauen Beine und das dunkelbraune Gefieder mit einem hellbraunen Bauch. Anfang des 19. Jahrhunderts wurden jährlich bis zu 2 Million Tiere durch den Menschen getötet, bis 1963 die letzte Sichtung auf Barbados bestätigt wurde. Seitdem wurde der Vogel nicht mehr gesehen und gilt als ausgestorben.
Vaquita (bedroht | Population 15): Der kalifornische Schweinswal oder „Vaquita“ ist eine Walart, die im nördlichen Teil des Golfs von Kalifornien beheimatet ist. Sie ist die am stärksten gefährdete Walart der Welt und wird seit 1996 als vom Aussterben bedroht eingestuft – die Jagd zu Wasser durch den Menschen hat zu dieser Bedrohung geführt, obwohl der Vaquita nur Beifang und nicht das eigentliche Ziel der Jagd ist. Im März 2018 lebten nur noch 12 bis 15 Vaquitas, was unvermeidlich zum Aussterben der Art führen wird, wenn keine drastischen Maßnahmen ergriffen werden. Das Wort Vaquita ist spanisch für „kleine Kuh“.

Die nachhaltige & ethische Zertifizierung der Mode 
Wir könnten uns nicht auf die Fahnen schreiben, das Bewusstsein für Nachhaltigkeit zu steigern und dann selbst nur fadenscheinig agieren. Deshalb produzieren wir zusammen mit unseren Lieferanten faire und zertifizierte Mode mit zeitlosem Design. Dabei haben wir darauf geachtet, dass nicht nur unsere Materialen nachhaltig produziert und entsprechend zertifiziert wurden, sondern wir ebenso die Arbeitsbedingungen, Energieversorgung und Wiederverwertung so fair und umweltschonend wie möglich gestalten.
Aus diesem Grund arbeiten wir sehr eng mit unserem Produzenten „Neutral: Certified Responsibility“ zusammen, um weiter an der Verbesserung unsere Entwicklungs- und Produktionsprozesse zu arbeiten.

Die digitale Lösung ""The Story Behind"":
Durch die Verbindung nachhaltig produzierter Mode mit dem Informations- & Unterhaltungseffekt einer technischen Spielerei wie einer Computer Vision & Augmented Reality Komponente, möchten wir dir eine Geschichte erzählen: Die Geschichte des kleinen Vaquita zum Beispiel, der mit nur noch 15 seiner Artgenossen in dem Golf von Kalifornien einsam seine Runden dreht und doch allzu oft als Beifang in Fischerbooten landet oder qualvoll in Fangnetzen erstickt.
CARTA - Unsere digitalen Lösungen
Wenn du auf unsere Website cartaclothing gehst und hierüber deine Kamera öffnest, kannst du das Stickmuster durch Computer Vision wie einen QR Code scannen und wirst automatisch zu unsere „The Story Behind“ weitergeleitet. Hier erzählen wir all die packenden Geschichten von Tieren und Pflanzen, die vom Aussterben bedroht oder bereits ausgestorben sind. Unsere AR Applikation bietet dir darüber hinaus die Möglichkeit, die einzigartigen Tier- & Pflanzenarten direkt in dein Wohnzimmer zu holen und sie zum Leben zu erwecken. Dieser Teil ist für uns der Aufwendigste. Falls du uns z.B. mit dem Kauf eines CARTA T-Shirts unterstützt, erhältst du das T-Shirt bereits vor Weihnachten 2020 und die AR Applikation wird für diese T-Shirts in Q1 2021 freigeschalten. Computer Vision für die packenden Geschichten hinter den Stickmustern funktioniert natürlich direkt wenn du es auspackst!

… putting aside whatever it is that you are doing right now, leaving everything where it’s at and walking away into a serene forest of solitude… as you’re wandering through this forest, you stumble upon a small body of water and decide to lie down in it… you float effortlessly on the surface, nothing but pure relaxation… and nothing in the entire world matters… time slows down, all the pain in your body fades away and your mind becomes as silent as the rocks beneath you… an immense feeling of peace and tranquility arises within… no stress, no distractions… letting go of all that no longer serves you… becoming as light as the air you are breathing… just you and nature, floating together in synchronized harmony…
OVERVIEW
Help us raise the funds necessary to build a Float Center in Downtown Duluth (the Greatest City on Earth). The goal is to open by Spring 2017.
The funds will go towards construction costs, a float tank and the completion of our business plan which is where the final funds will come from.
'Floating' is relatively new to most people... it's basically like relaxing in outer space to sum it up in a sentence. You get your own float suite where you shower before and after the float and everything you need is provided: towels, shampoo, conditioner, etc...
Reserve your float time now and receive up to 53% off our regular price of $65/float (see rewards on the right).
Floating is for everyone and has a countless number of health benefits, see what it can do for you!
What is 'floating' all about?
Float tanks, also known as Float Pods, Isolation Tanks or Sensory Deprivation Tanks are being used all across the world for a plethora of different reasons: relieving chronic pain, neck pain, back pain, arthritis, depression, insomnia, anxiety, stress, recovering from injuries, enhancing creativity & learning, clearing the mind, relaxation, meditation and simply for the one of a kind experience that floating provides.
Within the lightproof and soundproof tank lies 10 inches of skin temperature water that contains about 1000 lbs of dissolved Epsom Salt which allows the body to float effortlessly above the water, basically defying gravity and giving the floater a sense of weightlessness... pretty much like being in space. Your body stretches out, your spine decompresses, tense muscles become relaxed, the mind naturally becomes calm and all the stress in your life just floats away... it is the only place on earth that provides this kind of environment.
As you lie in the tank, your mind and body will come into harmony with one another, ensuring one of the deepest states of relaxation that you've probably ever experienced.

Dream Pod
Why have a Float Center in Duluth?
...For those long winter months we all cherish so deeply, for anyone suffering from chronic pain, back pain, neck pain, arthritis, stress, depression, anxiety or any physical/metnal ailment, for athletes seeking quicker recoveries and enhanced performance; artists who wish to expand their creative mind, college students who want to relax and study after their float, to escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life, for any person who seeks complete relaxation like never before or to experience nothing and jump into an oasis in the middle of January. Floating will benefit your overall health in so many ways, even the epsom salt in the water helps to maintain proper magnesium levels within the body. The art of floating is a very powerful tool that can be utilized by anyone for any reason... but especially for those sub-zero winter months ;)
A Float Center in the heart of Duluth will bring about increased health, less stress and enhanced creativity for the whole community... as well as a place for artists, photographers and creators of all kinds to showcase their art and collaborate with each other. It will be one more addition to never-ending list of wonderful activities and things to do in the North Woods of Minnesota for both locals and visitors.

'Floating' as a solution to the current epidemic of stress and anxiety
Why are we having an epidemic of stress and anxiety in our world?
For most of us, as soon as we wake up in the morning, we are going from place to place, taking phone calls, checking Facebook, eating unhealthy food, talking with coworkers whom we don’t enjoy talking to, eating more unhealthy food, running the kids around, staying up to date on all the latest technology and reading about all the horrible things going on the world… only to get to the end of the day, watch some T.V. and sleep for a few hours before we wake up and do it all over again, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, all year round. It is a vicious cycle that so many of us go through... a direct result of living in an overstimulated information-filled environment with nowhere to go to release all of the built up tension inside ourselves. Only in the last few decades have we been living such a demanding and stressful lifestyle.
A solution to this madness is floating. Floating in a near zero-gravity environment where you are free from all sensory input to your brain, lets the body & mind relax 100%. As your body rids itself of all the stress, so does your mind. There are no distractions in this place and all of your physical and mental ailments finally have time to relax and heal.
This method of relaxation and recovery is the latest in modern technology. The float tanks themselves provide an environment that you can find nowhere else in the world. The industry of floating and floatation therapy is rising at an incredible rate. What started out in the 1950’s is now growing into a world-wide solution for an anxiety and stress ridden culture. Only in the last decade has the industry been flourishing so rapidly. Scientific research is being done daily on this matter and is continuing to show the astonishing, vast array of health benefits involved with floating. Below is a video showing some of the most recent scientific research that is being done on floatation therapy by Dr. Justin Feinstein.
Floatation Therapy is scientifically proven and there are a countless number of testimonials from people who regularly float describing the health benefits that it provides for them. It is a simple, organic and natural way of getting to the core of the problems in our lives that we face today.
""Most importantly, the float tank is not a hypothetical laboratory phenomenon, but a viable, proven technology"" -Dr Henry Adams, NIMH, Washington.
Where will 'The Float Lodge' be located?
The Float Lodge will be located at 25 West 1st Street in Downtown Duluth. Across from Legacy Glassworks & Duluth Hydroponics. Sammy's pizza is just down the block as well, so you can go eat some za right after your float.
There will also be an area dedicated to relaxing, creating art, reading/writing books and hanging out before and after your float... complete relaxation space.
How 'floating' entered my life
I experienced my first float about a year ago... at the time I had just graduated from high school, knew that I didn't want to continue education at a university and thus decided to move to Colorado for the winter... previously living in Minnesota my whole life. The move ended up turning into a five month road trip that took me all across Western half of the United States, down through New Mexico and Arizona, along the coast of California and up to Oregon where I then flew out to the Big Island of Hawaii to do work trade for a Hotel/Hostel. After 2 months of living in middle of the Pacific Ocean and many nights sleeping under the stars I finally made my way back to Minnesota.
I first heard about floating on the internet while watching a Joe Rogan Podcast during Mr. Haugrud's history class back in high school. With my interest hooked, I dove head first into researching everything there was to know about this strange new thing people called 'floating' and what it's all about. I said to myself that one day I will experience floating first hand... sure enough while on my road trip across the US, that day came. I booked an appointment at a wellness center in Arizona right before taking off from Colorado...
A few days later...
...Upon waking up surrounded by cacti in my White Oldsmobile Alero which was parked on the side of a Freeway somewhere outside of Phoenix, I proceeded to drive into town for my float...
Mental Clarity is what I received from those 60 minutes of floating... In the midst of being in the tank, I lost sense of which way my body was oriented. Gradually this feeling came over me that I was floating in space and then I was actually seeing my body float through space at what felt like million miles an hour, but I was completely relaxed and calm... It was incredible because ever since I was a kid I had always dreamed about the mysteries of space, and now I was experiencing it. The feeling I had immediately after stepping out of the tank was like none other. My body felt as light as a cloud, my mind was crystal clear, I had an almost overwhelming sense of calmness and everything seemed to have a subtle glimmering shine to it.. sorta like how I imagine a filthy, mud plastered vehicle would feel right after a trip to the car wash... with that wonderful clean car smell and spotless glossy finish. I didn't just feel super relaxed and calm afterwords.. it was different than that. It was a whole new level of relaxation, calmness and healing that I noticed not just on a physical level, but on a mental level as well. I felt a greater sense of appreciation for all things. It was simply a time for my mind and body to let it's guard down and just be.. to heal and repair any impurities existed within myself. It was a feeling of total rejuvenation and healing of my whole being, unlike anything I had ever felt before.
 Reflecting upon my 'float' experience, I came to realize all the benefits floating can have on an entire community. Bringing together people of all ages and ethnicities, artists and creators, students and businesspeople to float, relax, connect and share our experiences with one another. That's when the decision to open up a float center was made. I truly feel that the possibilities, healing effects and positive benefits that come along with floating are infinite and endless.
Moving Forward
The plan is to maintain a state of the art float facility in one of the most beautiful cities in northern Minnesota: low rates, discounts for college students and [hopefully] discounts for Whole Foods Coop Owners & YMCA members, an outlet for independent creators of all kinds to create, communicate and showcase their artwork, a welcoming environment for everyone, high quality equipment and an awesome staff.
'The Float Lodge' is a central hub for people to relax, heal and become their greatest self...a place that can be used and enjoyed all year round, bringing together a community and embracing this new-found technology.

646,542333451,"    There's a special story behind these suits! It all started with a truly adventurous friendship between my grandfather, Robert 'Bob' Bernard and ski racing buddies Norma & Joe Lausmann. Norma began designing and hand sewing neon ski racing suits in the early 80s. She hand picked psychedelic prints and created a style never before seen on the mountain. The trio raced into their 80s around the world, competing in Downhill and Slalom Masters Ski Races - often winning Gold, Silver and Bronze in their age class.
The ski suits took on a new life when I (grand-daughter to Bob Bernard) got my hands on the them. I found that they were as big a hit off the ski slopes as they were on, at events like Coachella, Burning Man and Daybreaker!! The quality of Norma's suits is better than any unitard I have ever worn. They've lasted generations and proved to be both functional and fabulous.
it's time we bring this style back to the snow!
Fast forward 35 years... Racysuits is now a budding brand ready for its first large production! Exploring more places than ever before - ski slopes, beaches, parties and festivals - all around the world. From the snow covered slopes of Montreal and California to the beaches of Australia and Mexico, to parties in New York City and the Nevada desert, Racysuits is ready to take on the world! 
 Starting with Norma's ski suit design has allowed us to recreate a one piece suit that embodies the functionality and durability of a professional ski suit. The ergonomic pattern is designed to provide you with increased flexibility and range of motion. Racysuits can support your every move, whether you're racing down a mountain or getting down on the dance floor!
  After a year of testing, producing samples, and getting customer feedback we've added a few NEW FEATURES! 
The ZIPPERS on the arms and the legs make fore easy dressing. 
There are TWO NEW POCKETS that will fit your phone (even the big iPhone 6), your ski pass, credit cards and any other essential items. One pocket on your left arm and one hidden breast pocket for your secret treasures. 
We will emphasize the 2 LAYERS again and again! Most one piece spandex suits are made with a thin layer of material, revealing everything . . . including the burrito you ate for lunch. Our 2 layer suits give you the ultimate body smoothing support making sure your neon booty is looking extra fabulous at all times. 
  Our print selection is inspired by some of the very first Racysuits hand sewn by Norma. We've worked to create a new collection that will satisfy all of your neon dreams.
Our custom prints will be digitally printed on a blend of Poly/Elastane fabric. The medium weight compression shape-wear fabric is body smoothing and 4-way stretch. This blend of fabric retains its shape and color, as well as being UV resistant and efficiently absorbing sweat.
The lining fabric that is in contact with your skin is carefully selected. We chose an elastane blend fabric that is soft to the skin, breathable and moisture wicking - keeping you dry and warm! Poly blend fabrics are also stain and odor resistant, helping you stay fresh through multiple wears.
Below are our 3 new prints that'll be produced if this Kickstarter is successful. If you choose a Racysuits Unitard Reward you will get to select one of the following designs!
                  Our 4-way stretch fully lined suits are extremely forgiving, providing a body smoothing effect that is flattering on all body shapes. They're designed to be tight and hug your body, creating an aerodynamic design similar to professional downhill ski racing suits. We have added two new sizes to our collection now offering XXS, XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL. Thanks to 4way stretch materials our suits fit a wide range of body types!
PLAY

  We're dedicated to keeping our production in the USA. The best part is we'll be able to visit our factory throughout the production process and monitor quality every step of the way. We've also done small batch test runs with our New York factories. You can see the outcome of these on our website. Having pre-existing relationships and experience with our factories is incredibly helpful. This Kickstarter production run won't be a guinea pig - we've already worked out the the kinks! Special thanks to Maker's Row for creating a community of Makers and Manufactures helping us bring production back to the USA.
  If we're lucky enough to reach our pledge goal in August (crossing our fingers, toes and eyes) we'll email each pledger and ask for sizes, prints and shipping info. All rewards will ship as soon as we receive them. Be sure to check your rewards delivery date for an ETA.
             Dear Supporter, 
This is a very exciting time in my life. I'm lucky enough to be working on a project that I'm incredibly passionate about - rediscovering the zest for life of generations before me. The best part about this project is the community and family behind it. 
My grandfather met Norma and Joe Lausmann when he first joined the USSA Far West Masters Ski Racing Association. Their friendship took them on trips around the world, racing in competitions globally. Bob Bernard , Norma and Joe Lausmann are legendary members of the Tahoe ski community. In the 1980's they spearhead the full time adult training program at Squaw Valley and Alpine Meadows that still continues to this day. Bob Bernard was also one of the founding members of the Far West Master Junior Scholarship Program that supports deserving junior racers. 
He held community positions such as Chairman in the Far West Devision, National Masters Chairman and USSA representative to FIS Masters Committee. He also spearheaded the Spyder Masters Alpine Team along with the founder of Spyder Active Sports, David Jacobs.
Bob Bernard's enthusiasm and commitment to the ski community on a national and international level has landed him a nomination to become an honored member of the U.S. Ski & Snowboard Hall of Fame (application pending). 
None of this would be possible without the support and encouragement from Norma Lausmann, now 93. She remembers every suit she ever made, every race she ever won, and attributes her speed and success to her favorite Racysuit - black with neon pink polka dots.
Wearing Racysuits brings this lifestyle back. Imagine all of the things you love best in life, the acts, the motions, the adventures, and the people that bring you the most joy in life. Now, throw a Racysuit into the mix and tell me life didn’t just get a lot more fun!
Building Racysuits is going to take a lot of hard work but the payoff is more than worth it. Seeing people of all ages skiing, surfing, dancing, and playing in Racysuits around the world is the best reward there is! I flip out every time I see a customer share a Racysuits photo. 
Thank you again for all your support! I look forward to decking you out in spandex ;)
xoxo,

 I'm new to Kickstarter – How does it work?
We set a goal -- in this case $10,000. We set a deadline for 30 Days. You pledge whatever you feel like. Remember that the bigger the pledge, the greater the reward (look above for a list of all the cool rewards we offer).
If we make the goal by the deadline, your credit card is charged what you pledged (but not until then). We will have met our goal, you get your rewards and everyone is happy.
Even if we meet our goal, you can keep pledging. You will still get your cool rewards and you’ll be able to make Colony Handcrafted Ales even bigger and better!
If we don't make the goal, your credit card is NOT charged, we DON’T get a penny and you DON’T get any of the wonderful rewards. Let’s make sure THAT horrible scenario doesn't happen.

Love a good movie filled with horses, hurdles, and heroes? So do we! Hello, we're Jerry and Christy McGlothlin, founders of Moving Visions Entertainment, a NC-based film production company and boy, have we got a story for you! Read on to learn our heart and vision behind the movie, then pick your favorite horse (reward level) from the names on the right, and let's get riding.
""Unbridled"" is an emotionally gripping, unforgettable and uplifting story of redemption, healing, and overcoming some of life’s greatest obstacles. This captivating feature film tells the tale of an abused girl who teams up with an abused horse and their journey to healing. Inspired by a true story, the movie features actors you love such as Eric Roberts (The Dark Knight; The Expendables) and T.C. Stallings (War Room; Courageous).
""Unbridled"" was created to draw attention to the practice of sexual slavery, which is growing in all parts of the world, paticularly in the suburbs of the USA. Please help us expose the atrocity of child sexual abuse and trafficking. With your support we will call attention to this industry and how to recognize this abuse. And what better way to do that than through a movie?!
What is ""Unbridled"" about?
1. ""Unbridled"" tells a gripping story of friendship, healing and redemption. 
Sarah Miller (Tea McKay) is a 16-year-old high school student with a secret: she's a victim and prisoner of human sex trafficking by her mother's boyfriend (Eric Roberts). Feeling ashamed, worthless and alone, she doesn't know where to turn. When her world crashes down she feels like she can't trust a single soul. But everything changes when she meets Dreamer, an abused and dysfunctional horse. Since both Sarah and Dreamer have been abused, they relate to each other. Not being able to trust anyone else, this abused horse becomes Sarah's only confidante. Slowly but surely Sarah and Dreamer begin to heal, start to believe in themselves again, and learn to grow healthy relationships. It's a captivating story of a girl who escapes her circumstances and through many twists and turns finally finds freedom from her abusers. 
2. ""Unbridled"" is inspired by true stories at a local riding academy.
""Unbridled"" is inspired by the Corral Riding Academy in Cary, NC. Since 2008 the Corral Riding Academy has been privileged to help over 100 abused girls through one-year long therapy programs. They pair up abused girls with abused horses and through intensive one-on-one training the girls teach the horses to trust. In the process the girls also learn to trust again. These true stories of hope and healing were the inspiration for ""Unbridled."" A portion of the proceeds from ""Unbridled"" sales go directly to Corral.
 3. ""Unbridled"" draws attention to the evil of sex trafficking. 
We produced ""Unbridled"" to call attention to child sexual abuse and the prevalence of sex trafficking. Child sex abuse and sex trafficking are far more common than most people realize. 
CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE STATISTICS (www.americanspcc.org):  
 • 1 in 4 girls and 1 in 6 boys will be sexually abused before they turn 18 years old.  
 • 325,000 children are at risk of becoming victims of commercial child sexual exploitation each year.

With your support we will be able to show how this industry is hurting these young children. 
4. ""Unbridled"" showcases the healing power of horses.
The star of our movie, Dreamer, is an amazing real-life champion horse. Dreamer plays a central role throughout the story and performs several amazing feats. Dreamer's trainer, real-life celebrity Lindsey Partridge, also appears in the movie. She is a Natural Horsemanship Freestyle Champion and the founder of Harmony Horsemanship. Lindsey and her two most famous horses traveled all the way from Ontario to North Carolina in order to be part of this movie. The entire cast and crew had so much fun working with Dreamer and Lindsey that we can't wait for you to see their performance.
5. ""Unbridled"" features world-famous actors playing intriguing characters.
The intriguing story of ""Unbridled"" is brought to life by our stunning cast. ""Unbridled"" features epic performances by Eric Roberts (The Dark Knight; The Expendables) and TC Stallings (War Room; Courageous). Spoiler alert: You will be fascinated by Roger (Eric Roberts), a villain who is creepy but at the same time irresistibly charming. Dey Young (Pretty Woman), Jenn Gotzon (Frost/Nixon, Alone Yet Not Alone, Doonby), Rachel Hendrix (October Baby, The Perfect Wave, Roses) and the rising star Tea McKay (Hurricane Bianca, Pass the Light) put up amazing performances you won't forget.
Why do we need the money? 
We just wrapped up 20 days of filming, so we have 100% of the footage. There are breathtaking horse shots, scenes that will move you emotionally, and exciting action sequences. We know the amazing potential of what we have so far so we want post production to be just as phenomenal as the rest of the movie. This movie deserves to be finished in style. With principal cinematography complete, we ask that you partner with us to provide additional finishing funds for a tremendous boost of quality in post production.
What will the money be used for? 
The money we raise on Kickstarter will be used for editing, color grading and music scoring. More precisely:
Editor finishes up and locks the editing 
Composer creates the accompanying musical score 
Sound designer creates, edits and mixes all the final sound in the film 
Colorist corrects and beautifies the appearance of the footage 
Graphic artists design the film's graphics and titles, poster and DVD cover 
Visual effects artists fix, clean and enhance the footage 
Technical engineers master the discs 
Public relations provides info about the film and where you can see it or how you can own it
Any money above our goal will go into promotion and distribution.
Why would you want to support us? 
1. Be part of a cause that needs support. Stand by these young innocent women by supporting the movie. Help us to make this movie a great success and to get the message out into the hands of as many people as possible.
2. Receive amazing rewards. We have something for everybody. We even have instantaneous rewards!
3. Be inspired by an unforgettable story of healing. By supporting this movie you can be energized with hope and in turn help others experience the friendship, healing and redemption that is possible!
Before we hit the trails, here's a quick recap:
“Unbridled,” a feature length drama inspired by true-to-life stories at a healing ranch for troubled teen girls in North Carolina, tells a tremendous story of redemption and triumph. Watch God's unconditional love in action as our heroine overcomes formidable obstacles and ultimately finds that it IS possible to live a life filled with joy. This is the power of story: to dive deep into the human heart, to expose the evil, and to embrace all that is good, beautiful and lovely. 
If that sounds like a story you want to see, and a cause you want to support, we've got a horse for you. Simply pick your favorite horse (aka reward level, horses not included) from the names on the right, and let's ride!
A note from the producer: 
We chose to create ""Unbridled"" for so many more reasons than just to create another movie. The inspiration behind ""Unbridled"" is threefold: 
1. All girls, young men, ALL people have innate value to God and others. Our lives have meaning, and no matter what difficulties you have encountered or what trauma you have experienced, no matter how bad it has been, your life is redeemable. Many people believe that if they are emotionally scarred they cannot be healed. Many people judge others in the same way. We are here to make a statement that all lives can be redeemed and all lives should be given the opportunity to heal and be made whole. 
2. This film is about YOU. So many of us walk around with a vision in our heart, a spark, a desire, and we squelch it daily with doubts or busyness. No vision to help others is too big or too small for you to accomplish. Joy Currey (the founder of the Corral Riding Academy) started helping others by teaching in inner city schools. She wanted to take it a step further and offer a safe place for girls to heal. She began with one horse, one saddle and one girl. ONE horse, ONE saddle, ONE girl. And look at the difference her resolve has made in the lives of girls in her community. We are creating ""Unbridled"" to reignite that spark in your heart. What dream has been on your heart and in your mind? To reach out and tutor neighborhood children, to work with those who are down and out, train homeless with job skills, answer a suicide hotline, volunteer in a home for young mothers, to foster or adopt, to notice those around you who are needy and lend a hand, to begin a place like Corral, where hurting girls and horses are healed? What is on your heart to do? Unbridled is the encouragement that no dream to help others is too big or too small for you to accomplish. 
3. We want to draw attention to the travesty of the sex trafficking industry and child sexual abuse. I realize this is a touchy subject. I also realize that hiding our heads in the sand won’t make it go away. The statistics show that our children, those we love, and those we don’t know are unsafe. Let’s learn to protect the most innocent in our society, beginning with the acknowledgement that there is a serious problem in the world, our country and in our backyards."

The Kogod Cradle is the most expensive venue we have ever performed in. Selling out will only cover a fraction of the production costs. Performances of this scale cost the company more than $6,000 for rehearsal expenses, theater rental, marketing materials, and other technical/design costs. Every dollar we raise from ticket sales and Kickstarter over that will go toward paying the 13 dancers and choreographers who volunteer their time, energy and talent all year round.

CHOP SHOP:  Bodies of Work presents the best contemporary dance from the greater Seattle area and beyond, alongside master classes and a free community outreach program.  Our mission is to bring quality contemporary dance to Seattle-area residents through education, interaction, dialogue, and experience; to support local, national, and international dance artists; and to promote the accessibility and presentation of contemporary dance for both new and experienced audiences.
Bryn Cohn + Artists at CHOP SHOP Master Classes 2014
WHAT WE DO
CHOP SHOP:  Bodies of Work is a two-pronged annual cultural event that fills January and February with performances, master classes, and a free community outreach program.
First, the Experience Dance Program - a collaboration with the City of Bellevue Parks & Community Services Department - offers a series of free lecture-demonstrations and introductory level modern dance classes, all taught by the Artists participating in the Festival. These free classes are held at various Community Centers throughout the City of Bellevue and are open to individuals and families of all ages, ethnicities, and demographic backgrounds. All participants in the Experience Dance Program are given a free ticket to the performances, allowing them to apply and connect their educational and physical experiences to the dance works they see in performance.
Secondly, the Festival brings together outstanding choreographers and companies for two public performances at The Theatre at Meydenbauer in Bellevue, Washington.  CHOP SHOP is unique in its approach, focusing on the presentation of highly creative, yet accessible work to both new and seasoned dance audiences.  During the daytime hours of the festival five master classes in a variety of dance styles are offered by the Artistic Directors of the participating companies.  Dance students can apply for Festival scholarships that provide free access to the full master class series, as well as a complimentary ticket to the performances.
WHY IT MATTERS
The purpose of CHOP SHOP, now approaching its 8th year, is simple:  the Festival serves as a platform to educate and offer insight about contemporary dance and its creative process, in order to forge deeper connections between artists and audiences through presentation, education, dialogue, and experience.
Spectrum Dance Theater at CHOP SHOP 2014
From 2008 - 2014 CHOP SHOP has presented or supported:
39 Dance Companies
74 Dance Works
209 Professional Dancers and Choreographers
500+ Experience Dance Program Participants
and served nearly 5,600 audience members.
WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP
Due to an unexpected change in grant award policy, CHOP SHOP is facing a budget shortfall of $8,000. Without these funds, CHOP SHOP 2015 will not happen. We need your help to continue bringing performance, education, and experience to our audience!
WHERE YOUR SUPPORT GOES
Like many arts organizations, CHOP SHOP is run on a shoestring no-frills budget, so every penny donated (after fees) goes to funding the Festival itself.  Your donation will be converted directly into Festival essentials (programs, posters, fliers, etc.) or will provide support for the artists involved (dancers, choreographers, sound/lighting technicians, videographer, etc.).

654,1895327012,"WHAT IS YOMEDDINE?
Yomeddine is a coming-of-age comedic drama, a road trip where two outcasts, Beshay and Shika, discover the harshness of the world outside the leper colony where they have spent all their lives.
After the death of his wife, Beshay and his apprentice Shika travel on a donkey cart southwards to search for what remains of Beshay's family. They hope to find out why his father never came back for him after dropping him off at the gates of the colony when he was a little child. 
The film is based on real characters that writer/director Abu Bakr Shawky has met at the Abu Zaabal Leper Colony while filming award-winning documentary ""The Colony"", which screened at many local and international film festivals around the world. You can watch the trailer here
Flyer of leprosy documentary ""The Colony""
We want to tell the stories of the people Abu Bakr met during his visits to the leper colony. A recurring story he heard was being dropped off at the gates of the colony as children and not seeing their families again. Yomeddine was conceived out of a hybrid of these true stories. Beshay, the illiterate childless leper and his schizophrenic wife; Hamed, the legless former truck driver; Gomaa, the railroad thief; Shika, the Nubian boy - these real characters find their place in the film.

Selected for NYU's Purple List: You can read more about it here 
Selected by Abu Dhabi Film Festival's SANAD Fund. Check out the announcement on Daily Variety and Ahram Online
UPDATE: NextPix Grant Winner
OUR GOALS
We want to make Yomeddine a quality film, artistically and technically. We are going to hire professional crew and a combination of professional actors as well as non-actors, who will add authenticity that professional actors may not be able to provide for this subject. 
HOW YOU CAN HELP
It's crunch time! We've got a good portion of our production budget in place so far - with a portion provided by the SANAD Fund as well as private investors - and this is our final push to make it happen! 
We are scheduled to begin principal photography in December and need your help to raise at least $20,000 in order to meet our budget and embark on this journey.
TRANSPORTATION & ACCOMMODATION 
This will require the majority of the money raised on Kickstarter, specifically because Yomeddine is a road movie. We are going to travel along the Nile from Cairo to Qena and will need logistical power: trucks to move equipment, RVs to transport cast and crew, and to ensure they are as comfortable as possible in the conditions of rural Egypt in order to work their magic on set!
MEALS
We're going to be on the road for the majority of the film, so we will need to provide meals for our hard-working crew. Preferably, we will have a mobile kitchen in order to ensure the quality of the food.
SECURITY
Traveling for days on end through the backroads of Egypt with expensive equipment and film crew hardly go unnoticed. We will need security with us at all times to ensure safety of everyone involved with the film. We take safety very seriously and will work above and beyond to ensure a safe work environment.
FINAL LOCATION SCOUTS
The director, producers, director of photography, and location manager need to go on a final survey of our locations in order to make sure there are no surprises when we arrive at to shoot.
EQUIPMENT RENTAL
Thanks to our wonderful Producer Dina Harb we were able to secure most of our camera equipment for free! However, there are still a few items we will need while we're on the road, such as grip and lighting kits, to name a few.
PROGRESS
November: We are deep into the casting process. We will conduct our final location scouts. In addition, we will secure our transportation and finalize logistics, accommodations, and crew.
December-January: Showtime! We are going to be on the road filming our movie!

656,641396780,"A Multimedia Website on the Past, Present and Future of one of Montreal's most Dynamic Neighbourhoods. 
(French version below)
Growing up in Milton-Park, I spent the summers playing street hockey with my friends who lived in the co-ops on St. Famille and Jeanne-Mance streets. At the time, I had no idea that the houses they lived in had been under threat of private development in the late '60s and '70s. Nor was I aware of the history of the Milton-Park Citizens' Committee and the radical 20-year battle that lead to the creation of the co-ops. 
It's important that this history be shared. That's why my project partner Julien Poirier-Malo and I are producing a website.  
Our Goals: To document the citizen-led movement for low-rent housing, present an oral history of the neighbourhood and explore the community's current challenges. 
Visit miltonparkstory.com to see what we've accomplished so far!
The Final Site Will Feature:
 • The audio documentary The Death and Life of an Inner-City Neighbourhood available free to either stream on the site or to download. 
   Preview:
An interactive map where residents will be able to post photos and add their own stories in the form of text or audio. 
A comprehensive timeline documenting many of the key events in the history of the community, from 1969 to the present. 
Infographics displaying the latest statistics on the members of the community, the neighbourhood and its history. 
 Audio interviews with a growing number of well-known residents and the people who have, and continue to make, Milton-Park one of Montreal's most vibrant neighbourhoods. 
A photo essay with 30 to 40 pictures of residents and independent business owners as well as behind the scenes shots of daily life in Milton-Parc.
How it all Started:
 The Milton-Park Story began as a group project for a multimedia journalism course at Concordia University. Julien and I produced an audio documentary on the grassroots battle that lead to the creation of the co-ops. But we felt there was more that could be added. We've since expanded the scope of the original documentary and have lined up many more interviews. We've also taken photos and started to map the history of the neighbourhood. But our website’s potential for displaying an even more comprehensive history of the community – and serving as a tool for a broad audience – is even greater. 
Why Donate?
Funding for The Milton-Park Story will help us: 
Purchase the proper equipment
Hire a web-developer to complete the design of the website 
Employ a professional photographer 
Translate the site so it is available in both English and French
Do community outreach to solicit stories from residents and to promote the project 
Why Now?
Due to the the 35-year anniversary of the co-ops on July 1 – and the looming expiry of the 35-year co-op mortgages – we are convinced that a collaborative oral history project and multimedia website that focuses on the neighbourhood will have a wide appeal both for residents of the neighbourhood and the greater Montreal community. It will also be of interest to international scholars studying co-operative housing models and land trusts.
It's an Exciting Time:
Recently the Milton-Parc Co-operative was selected as a finalist for the Habitat for Humanity Awards. In addition, resident and community activist Lucia Kowaluk was named to the Order of Canada. It's also a time of changes and renewed struggles, including efforts to ensure that the Hôtel-Dieu Hospital continues to service the community as well as the ongoing battle to preserve Parc Oxygène.
Thus far, we’ve received positive feedback from many members of the community. We have even been asked to present the project in person on July 1st at the MAI centre as part of the 35th anniversary celebration. This has motivated us to push ahead and create a website large enough in scope that it will serve as a true reflection of this unique neighbourhood and benefit the community for many years to come.

The Milton-Park Story : Une bataille pour un quartier accessible à tous
L’histoire d’une communauté montréalaise qui s’est battue contre un géant immobilier pour créer l’un des plus grands quartiers d’habitation coopérative de l’histoire du pays.
Un site web multimédia sur le passé, le présent et l’avenir de l’un des quartiers les plus dynamiques de Montréal. 
 Ayant grandi dans Milton Parc, j’ai des souvenirs de journées complètes passés à jouer au hockey avec mes amis qui vivaient dans les coopératives des rues Jeanne-Mance et Sainte-Famille. À l’époque, je n’avais aucune idée que les ambitions de grandeur d’un promoteur immobilier avaient menacé ces maisons dans les années 1970, et la féroce bataille du Comité de Citoyennes et Citoyens de Milton Parc pour sauver le quartier m’était aussi inconnue. 
 Or, cette histoire, il est important qu’elle soit partagée. C’est la raison pour laquelle mon collègue Julien Poirier-Malo et moi avons démarré ce projet journalistique. Notre but : Documenter cette bataille citoyenne pour du logement accessible à tous, verbaliser l’histoire du quartier par la voix des citoyens, et explorer les enjeux qui touchent la communauté aujourd’hui. Visitez miltonparkstory.com pour voir ce qui est déjà en développement ! 
La mouture finale du site inclura : 
 • Un documentaire radio intitulé « Déclin et survie d’un quartier central » disponible en baladodiffusion ou en téléchargement. 
Bande-annonce : 
• Une carte interactive du quartier sur laquelle les résidents peuvent partager leurs histoires en photos, témoignages écrits ou vidéos. 
 • Une ligne du temps détaillée qui retrace les événements majeurs de la bataille citoyenne de 1969 à nos jours.
 • Des statistiques illustrant la réalité actuelle et passée de Milton Parc. • De courtes entrevues radio avec des figures du quartier qui ont façonné (et qui façonnent toujours) l’histoire. 
• Un essai photo de 30 à 40 images de résidents et d’entreprises indépendants qui ont modelé l’image du quartier depuis ses débuts. 
Comment le projet a commencé : 
 The Milton-Park Story a été lancé dans le cadre d’un cours de journalisme à l’Université Concordia en hiver 2014. Julien et moi avons produit un documentaire radio sur la bataille citoyenne des années 70 et 80 mais, au terme du semestre, avons réalisé qu’il était possible de creuser bien plus profondément. Depuis, nous avons élargi le mandat du projet et multiplié les entrevues. Or, le potentiel inexploité de notre site web demeure immense. 
 Pourquoi financer ? 
 Votre contribution nous aidera à :
• Acheter ou louer de l’équipement (photo, vidéo, radio) 
• Embaucher un designer web pour maximiser le potentiel du site 
• Embaucher un photographe 
 • Traduire intégralement le site en français 
• Payer les droits d’auteurs de documents d’archives que nous voulons exploiter. 
• Faire la promotion du projet à l’intérieur et au-delà des frontières de Milton Parc. 
 Pourquoi maintenant ? 
 Considérant que les 35 ans du quartier coopératif sont soulignés cette année (de même que la tant appréhendée fin des subventions fédérales aux résidents), nous sommes d’avis que notre projet d’histoire orale trouvera écho autant chez les résidents que dans le monde coopératif, voire la région métropolitaine de Montréal toute entière. 
D’ailleurs, le projet intéresse également déjà des universitaires venus de l’extérieur du Canada. Et ce n’est pas tout ! En 2013, le quartier Milton Parc a été sélectionné comme finaliste pour les prix annuels de l’organisme Habitat pour l’humanité. D’autre part, Lucia Kowaluk, l’un des pivots centraux de la bataille pour la sauvegarde du quartier dans les années 70 et aujourd’hui toujours militante sur plusieurs fronts, fut récompensée par une nomination à l’Ordre du Canada. 
 Mentionnons également que jusqu’à maintenant, Julien et moi avons reçu d’excellents commentaires de la part de membres de la communauté. Dans le cadre des célébrations du 35e anniversaire, nous présenterons notre projet à la population le 1er juillet au centre MAI, en plein cœur de Milton Parc. 
 En somme, il nous a semblé évident que l’approfondissement de notre projet était non seulement justifié, mais nécessaire pour préserver le souvenir des premiers balbutiements du quartier, réitérer son caractère unique aujourd’hui et en assurer la pérennité, voire la duplication ailleurs dans le monde.

Hey everybody! My name is Marlee, here's the scoop... I am a self taught artist who produces kaleidoscopic works of art in all different syles. After spending my whole life painting and making connections, I have a pretty decent sized following and a lot of people interested in my work, but here is the problem.. I have NO ROOM to do said work. 
As any new mother would, I turned my studio room into a nursery for my super awesome baby girl, but now I need space to keep creating for not only me but for her too. Even with my day job as an art teacher my funds are tight.
 I have never used Kickstarter before but after what I've seen on here, I figured I might as well give it a go. So this is what I am asking.. If you like what you see and would like to play apart in my growth as an artist here is your chance to help. And of course if you do, thank you from the bottom of my heart. And if you can't, thank you for listening to my story.
Here are some paintings for you checkout and of course my adorable baby girl!

658,597816296,"Did you know that Alberta sends 2.2 million barrels of oil to the U.S. every day, 40 per cent of U.S. oil imports? That’s 50 per cent more than North Dakota, enough to fuel 20 percent of America’s cars and trucks.
And yet few Americans know much about the nature and complexity of western Canada’s energy industry, or about the costs, benefits and tradeoffs involved in providing America with such a significant amount of its energy needs.
We’re going to change that.
The Alberta oil sands and the pipelines that deliver its oil to the United States are an important part of Canada’s economy, but they are also some of the most controversial energy projects in the world. 
Despite significant opposition from environmentalists and Indigenous people, as well as the provinces of B.C. and Quebec, both U.S. President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau are championing pipelines that would increase oil sands production further—even while Canada struggles to meet its international climate change commitments.
That’s why the University of Montana School of Journalism is organizing the Northern Exposure Reporting Project, and sending a team of intrepid student journalists to Western Canada this May. 
We will travel 2000 miles by van to explore every nook and cranny of western Canada’s resource-based culture and economy. We’ll stop in Calgary and Edmonton, the economic and political capitals of Alberta, to interview politicians and industry leaders, and then venture north to Fort McMurray, the proud home and heart of the Alberta oil sands. 
From there, we’ll follow the route of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project to the West Coast, where oil companies hope to load Alberta oil on to tankers in southwest B.C. and northwest Washington state. 
Along the way, we’ll be creating meaningful multimedia coverage of a variety of issues, including endangered species management, Aboriginal treaty rights, and the fate of the Trans Mountain pipeline, now owned by the Canadian government. 
Our goal is for these students to come away with rigorously reported and professionally produced work that we can promote on a cutting-edge multimedia website, and get in the hands of editors and producers looking for great work and young talent.
To that end, we’d like you to join us on the Northern Exposure Reporting Project. Our students have invested $30,000 of their own money for this opportunity.  
Your support will help to offset some of our travel and equipment costs and allow us to cover more ground and visit remote communities so we can tell the stories that matter most to our readers and viewers. Here’s our wish list:
 Rental cars to get our journalists where they need to be in a timely matter 
A flight to Fort Chipewyan, which is inaccessible by car, to follow up on stories about a potential cancer cluster and the biggest remote solar farm in Canada
Help offsetting the not-insignificant cost of food, gas and lodging
A drone to take pictures and video from the sky
Your support will also help us document our work on our website, and promote our journey on a daily basis via social media—no matter where we are. 
Please join us today."
659,1066488269,"Legacy Kids Magazine is an annual publication for military children. Each volume is full of inspiring stories, artwork, and hands-on activities centered around resilience and bravery. This lovingly-crafted publication enables military kids to use their own creative voices to empower, enlighten, and uncover the truths about growing up in an unconventional lifestyle. Legacy Kids offers an outlet for children within this community to understand their own feelings and uplift others along the way.
Seeing firsthand the weight the military lifestyle had on their own kids, the Legacy Kids team understood the significance of a positive outlet for children to share their wide scope of personal experiences. The team felt that creative expression could help move young writers and artists through their emotions, and at the same time help guide other military kids through theirs.
When children understand that they belong to a community, a sense of acceptance replaces feelings of loneliness and confusion. This type of kinship can develop a strong sense of self and instill a treasured connection to other military kids.
Legacy Kids Magazine fosters this community. It is a tangible publication that highlights a wide range of emotions and experiences through bright, bold, and honest content. This creative endeavor opens an important space that allows us to see and hear military children as they invite us into their world.
When your child is done spending time with this magazine, they will walk away feeling understood and empowered to embrace this lifestyle from a new, positive perspective.
Our readers embody the resilience and bravery of all military kids. They are authentic creatives, innovators, and dreamers that come together from many different backgrounds and ages for a much-needed sense of unity and strength in community.
The contributors for Volume I consist of children and adults alike. Our writers represent the voice of military kids ranging from just three years old, all the way through to adulthood.
Skilled artists, graphic designers, quillers, and photographers carefully curated and designed beautiful, eye-catching visuals to individually complement each article. Each contributor has a connection to military service members, offering unique perspectives and imagination of this lifestyle.
Writers: Nicole Ryan from Elite Dance, Brady Gallagher from Hot Asana Yoga, Michelle Cuthrell from Of Capes and Combat Boots, Tony Cross, Victoria Reyes: Interviewee, Christin Daubert, Samantha Peterson, Jenny Lynne Stroup, 
Illustrators: Kimberly Mortson, Griffin Carrick, Alyssa Moore, Chelsea Colden, Jane Randall, Kristine Farnum, Ken Bunnell

The vibrant layouts motivate readers to dig into content that highlights the environment, community, wisdom, mind, body, and creativity of military kids. Our writers dive into the heart of being a military kid from multiple perspectives, offering different outlooks to children looking for guidance.
Military parents explore different seasons with their children and offer valuable advice as they navigate through the military lifestyle.
The entertaining activity content allows children to immerse themselves in the pages and connect through hands-on fun. Every page is bound together with inspiring art and photography to honor military kids’ experience, originality, and heart.
As you will see below, there are many opportunities available to get involved, such as pledging, subscribing, partnering, supporting, sharing, or becoming one of our wholesalers. Your collaboration will help physically print the magazine and get this much-needed publication into the hands of adult and child readers alike. Don’t miss out on this opportunity to launch positive change within the greater service member community. We are excited to have you join us as we endeavor to encourage community, creativity, and courage in the lives of military children.

OUR PROCESS
Each of our garments go through a lengthy process from concept to creation.
Our fabrics and print processes are rigorously tested to comply with safety and license standard requirements.
Our designs go through a multi-stage approval process with each licensor to ensure the designs are true the character and company's story."
661,545272619,"THE BRAND 
At Oxblood & Co. we embrace the irregularities of hand drawn design and hand pulled screen prints to create unique items. We love what we do and where possible we produce as much as we can in-house and where we can't, we only work with the best.
For the past year we have been working hard to get our online store up and running. We have also been drawing and doodling in preparation for our next range. So here we are all ready to get our second range produced.
RANGE No.2 Oxblood & Co. 
T-shirts Our t-shirts are screen printed by hand in Yorkshire, England. Each design is a hand drawn original. We start with a word or a phrase, then take pen to paper. When we have created a design that we think you will love, we send it to print! 
Our unisex t-shirts are a tri-blend, crew neck with a great shape that is a little longer than a standard tee for a fashion fit. Ladies t-shirts are 100% cotton with rolled sleeves.
Unisex Sizes: Chest (to fit) S - 37"", M - 39"", L - 42"", XL - 44"", 2XL - 46""
Ladies Sizes: Chest (to fit) S 18 1/3” M 19 1/3” L 20 3/4”
On dark garments we tend to print using a discharge process. This process removes the garments colour and replaces with another pigment, leaving a design that has a super soft feel without the heavy ink coverage.
Bobble Hats A classic chunky knit winter bobble hat, just in time to hit the slopes.
Leather Earphone Wrap Our leather earphone wraps are made from 5mm full grain leather, they are laser cut and etched before being finished by hand. The wraps are designed to keep your earphones in check and reduce the chance of tangling.

THE GOAL - OUR SECOND RANGE
We hope that this Kickstarter project will allow us to produce our second range that will be despatched from Dec 1st. 
Our wider goal is to take our brand to the streets.  Starting with a small popup store at Leeds Corn Exchange, then moving on to Spitalfields Market in shoreditch, a young and vibrant part of London. "
662,109811969,"THE BRAND
WINSOME is a line of clothing and curated goods based in the Northeast neighborhood of Minneapolis, Minnesota, in a warehouse studio with a mysterious military past. We design and sew our clothes in-house, and we feature goods that are made in the USA by artists and craftspeople we admire.
The inspiration for our garments is found in the bolts of fabric we start with. Our garments are designed to be modern and unique, but also to retain classic elements of fit and finish that makes each item familiar and comfortable enough to be daily staples. Clean lines, impeccable fit, and quality construction are our goals. The entire process, from sketching to packaging, is kept under our own roof in order to maintain a high level of quality and craftsmanship, and to reduce wasted time and materials. And every garment is produced in very limited quantities. In short, we keep it small to keep it awesome
THE PROJECT
In the world of boutique fashion and brands, we often feel like there's a big gap between a given company and a customer. Winsome wants to create more intimate relationships with our fans and customers, in addition to partnerships with other designers and boutiques that will lead to unexpected and excellent things. The Winsome Mobile Studio will represent ultimate transparency into our clothing design and production practices. It will bring the process of designing small, limited run collections to many cities and towns around North America. The idea was born from the desire for more interaction with Winsome customers than can be had online, and from a yearning for the kind of inspiration that can only come from travel.
The Airstream itself will consist of a minimal clothing design studio (2 sewing machines, a cutting table, clothing rack, pressing table and storage), as well as a small living space for the designer while on the road (a bed, kitchenette, wet-bath and storage).
While in a location, an assemblage of garments will be designed and produced in the same limited-run that we use in our Minneapolis studio. Materials for the styles will be purchased in or around that location as often as possible, and all production will happen on site. Winsome will then partner with local boutiques and bloggers to host pop-up shops where people can check out the locally made collection, tour the mobile studio, and hang out with yours truly.
This Kickstarter campaign's purposed is to fund the renovation of the Airstream trailer, and to get it road ready as the Winsome Mobile Studio. The trailer is a 31-foot Airstream Sovereign Land Yacht. It has not been updated since it was built in 1975, and will need a lot of work in order to become the Winsome Studio. The trailer will but gutted down to the frame. New insulation will be installed, electrical systems will be replaced and updated, and plumbing will be relocated. From there, new interior walls and laminate floors will be put in, a small wet-bath will be built, a kitchenette will be purchased and added, and room dividers and custom furniture will go in. Finally, the studio's ""soul"" will be added when we install our industrial sewing machines, tables, storage and notions.
This project cannot come to life without your help! Thank you so much for taking the time to learn about our ideas and goals.

663,1866352125,"I am building a 58-panel (80"" x 56"" to 80"" x 7"") painting space to create a four-room, psychologically charged painting-in-the-round. The installation is the largest undertaking I have ever attempted and I very much hope we can all experience the completed project, through the help of your generous support. Completing the space is projected to cost $12,000, though the more funding the space receives, the grander the finish will become. The painting is primarily oil on canvas and is meant to explore our human understanding of perspective, depth, space, and architecture. The series houses an interactive seating area, inviting the composition beyond the bounds of the canvas and allowing the dialogue of the installation and viewer to change according to the human element present, creating an environment unique to each visitor.
The film ""Hope in a Box"" presents in-process shots of the main dining room/ living area. In building this space, I very much hope to gain perspective on not only my own sense of self as an artist, but on where and how we blur the lines in observation, experimentation, mimesis and representation-- to create, in essence, a corner of my own empire, encapsulated.

COST:
Since I can remember I have always sought to poke the proverbial hornet's nest, which of course has gotten me more than my fair share of stings. This was, however, my most logical means of figuring out what was inside and attempting to deconstruct the logic behind the beasts within. As an adult I have continued this scientific delving and ended up building a nest of my own. While I am asking for $10,000, the painting space is projected to ACTUALLY COST $12,000 (eeeek!), though the more backing I receive the more I will be able to explore the exterior. My art is experiential in nature, and I ultimately seek to present a fully sensorial interaction for the viewers. Alas, this project is financially prohibitive for a poor graduate student, thus I am asking you all to help me support my dream of building a castle of my own.
WHY $12,000???!!!??!
I am here to let you know I have very realistic and fixed parameters for the completion of this project with, of course, the support of people like you. I am so excited to see the finished space and to share this with all of you!
BREAK-DOWN:
Wooden stretchers- $4,000
Canvas- $1,200

""Cornelia!! Why can't you just do SIMPLE things that are within your realistic time and money budget??!""
Yes, yes, yes, I have heard this before and am not naive to placing realistic parameters on the largess of my ambitions. I just often get excited about the concept and then say, ""Well if this is going to happen, go BIG or go HOME!"" This is my ingrained perfectionism and stubborn-headedness, I am sure. I am letting everyone know I AM setting realistic goals for completion, they are just a bit out of my grad-student-in-art-school budget. I am asking you to help me realize and complete this dream by giving what you can.

664,99443264,"Wait, what?  Here’s our exciting news!
It’s official! Our FIRST TOUR across the country! We have been asked to perform as part of The (illustrious) Dance Gallery Festival in not one but TWO cities: Houston, TX at Sam Houston State University October 17 & 18 and at the Ailey Citigroup Theatre in Midtown Manhattan on October 25, 2014! http://www.dancegalleryfestival.com
Our new duet, You Win, premiered in Tampa in June, 2014 and was also presented in Seattle at Velocity Dance Center during the July 2014 Seattle Festival of Dance Improvisation. In October, we will join an unbelievably talented group of international dancers and choreographers. Only a handful of choreographers out of the hundreds of applicants have been chosen to show their work on the Houston and New York stages. We are so grateful and humbled to be one of them and to have the honor of performing in both.
You Win (Photo: Tom Kramer)
Here’s a little bit about The Dance Gallery Festival…
The Dance Gallery Festival was created by Astrid von Ussar and Mojca Ussar in 2007 and has since become a well-known festival with showcases in two states NY and TX. At each venue, they provide a state-of-the-art theater, complete with production staff, marketing, and public relations support to showcase each choreographers work. Having been met with much praise and enthusiasm from artists, audiences and critics alike, The Dance Gallery Festival has quickly become an essential and anticipated addition to the dance world. This type of venue helps deepen the public’s appreciation and support for concert dance. In the Dance Gallery Festival’s seven year history, a tremendous amount of talent has been showcased. Their aim is to continue cultivating that talent by creating another performance vehicle that supports the growth of dance companies by providing increased exposure and performance opportunities. http://www.dancegalleryfestival.com
Brian & Erin dancing in Arc presented at The Dance Gallery Festival in 2013
Logistics…
Airfare: round trip airfare from Seattle to Houston, Tampa to Houston and then Seattle to New York and Tampa to New York. And yes, there will be a couple of cross country red-eye flights, but we know it will be worth it!
Lodging: while away from home, we need somewhere to rest our tired heads. With so many different sites online for booking hotels, we have found one that is within walking distance of the Theaters…keeping transportation costs while out of town to the rock bottom price of bringing our best walking shoes.
Per Diem and Travel Expenses: Food, water, to and from the airports and all those little things when you’re out of town can get pretty pricey!
Processing Fees: A percentage of our funds go back to Kickstarter for providing this wonderful fundraising forum.  
Why go through all this effort?
As Tampa/Seattle dance artists, the chance to perform in Houston and New York at The Dance Gallery Festival will help create national recognition for our work and future endeavors. With a performance at Sam Houston State and Ailey Citigroup Theatre, that have a history of selling out, we have the wonderful opportunity to represent dance from opposite ends of the country. We will also have the chance to teach a partnering technique master class to the students at Sam Houston State.

Cosmo The Space Detective by Ezequiel Nieto
Story Summary
Cosmic Callisto Caprica, or Cosmo for short, is having the night of her life. On the same evening that she receives her junior detective's license, Cosmo is assigned to her first case. For her first case Cosmo will travel to the luxury space station The Titian to investigate a robbery. The luxurious rings of Saturn have been stolen! The owner of the rings, Princess Rhea, a Martian of royal decent, desperately needs her rings back. Cosmo will have to follow all of the clues in order to solve her first case.
Cost
Why am I asking for $3,000 dollars? I'll tell you why. $2,000 will go towards purchasing a publishing package from Lulu.com. This package will provide me many different things, but the most important items in this package are the ISBN Assignment number and copyright registration. The remaining $1000 will cover the cost of editing, art and e-book formatting.

666,1147666893,"I Wanna Do That!
The move from spectator to participant is a quantum leap. Yet each Mardi Gras in New Orleans, thousands of people make it, abandoning inhibition and reveling in the ever-growing creative phenomenon of marching krewes.
To celebrate this untold story, we announce I Wanna Do That!: Celebrating the Magic of Mardi Gras Marching Krewes (IWDT), a coffee table book bursting with photographs to document and illustrate this important New Orleans-centered cultural movement. We agree with local arts critic Doug McCash who says, “At this juncture, marching krewes are one of the best art stories in the city.” 
Ok...so, what is a marching krewe?
Simply put, a marching krewe is a group of like-minded people who get together for the purpose of marching in parades that take place during the Carnival (Mardi Gras) season.
These krewes come in all shapes, sizes, and variations, yet they all share the attributes of creativity, artistry, quirkiness, humor, inclusiveness, and accessibility. Krewes are composed of people who practice dance moves, sew costumes, and create “throws” to hand out to a covetous public. People for whom participation is a badge of civic identity. People who at one point stood on the curb and said “I wanna do that!!” 
Realizing that the marching krewe field has expanded exponentially, our team knew it was a story that must be told. Two incredibly talented local photographers worked tirelessly to document the creative energy of the 2020 Mardi Gras season, with additional information collected to document more than 300 marching krewes in New Orleans. Following an extraordinary amount of photo organizing and curating, interviewing participants and writing, we are ready to launch this beautiful photographic narrative! 
 The result
I Wanna Do That! is a 9” x 11” hardcover book with about 224 pages and 250 color-rich photographs. Printed on premium paper, the book is hardback with four process color plus matte, scuff resistant nylon lamination.
Why support us when there are so many other needs in the world?
The marching krewe story is one of a continual evolution. IWDT documents this movement in a wildly culture-rich city, one that is fanatic about Mardi Gras (many of us have a closet specifically for costumes!) This labor of love is not only candy for the eyes, but a legacy publication to document this important story. It’s a book for locals, visitors, and anyone who celebrates joyful creativity. 
 Supporting our local cultural community is critical to its preservation and continuation. For each book sold, we will allocate a portion to www.feedthesecondline.org, (a project organized by a New Orleans marching krewe) that provides food, love and employment to the culture-bearers who maintain the traditions that make our city unique.  Funds raised on Kickstarter are solely to provide for expenses related to the book.  
Ok..so how is this going to  happen?
A great deal of the work has been done, now we need your help! Funds raised from this Kickstarter will be used to pay the photographers and cover the expense of designing, printing and marketing the book.
Our $18,000 goal is the minimum needed to start printing, but it is not the limit. The more books we can print, the further we can spread the good word and the joy. And the rewards are most excellent and available only during this Kickstarter!
 Ok...so, who is this creative team?
We are New Orleanians who love everything about Mardi Gras and who have the utmost passion for the wide variety of marching krewes.
Echo Olander:  This Yankee child has found home and heart in the wide bayous, smoky clubs and parade routes of New Orleans.  Since the 1970s she has been exploring the intricate layers of New Orleans culture and working to build creative capacity in the city.  Her current interest is the fertile place where self and community find vibrant connection. (instigator, writer, producer)
Yehonathan “Yoni” Goldstein: Yoni’s first Mardi Gras morning in 1990 was a revelatory reminder that there is still magic in the world. His inquisitive mind has led him through several career incarnations including: travel agent, band manager, banquet chef, poker player and project manager.  He is currently way behind schedule on creating his next Mardi Gras costume. (writer, producer)
Ryan Hodgson-Rigsbee: Ryan’s photographic heart is on the streets of New Orleans.  With a wide client list of national and local editorial publications, this Chicago native also has a number of long running personal projects exploring culture, music, and landscape in New Orleans and other unique communities across the nation.  He is relentless in his goal of reaching the public with photography that is both compelling and culturally responsible.  See more at rhrphoto.com (photographer)
Patrick Niddrie: Patrick found an outlet for his bold, colorful artistic sensibilities when he discovered photography in 2007.   Leaving his birthplace of New Orleans with nothing but camera and curiosity, his lens has guided him from the Swiss Alps to the Ganges Delta, with regular returns to document the vibrancy of New Orleans.  Patrick likes to keep things loose, leaving space for polished, spontaneous moments; a perfect match for marching krewes.  See more at patrickniddrie.com  (photographer)

667,14921614,"So what's this all about?
We are a group of four artists, Martha Beaumont, Mark Morgan, Estella Castle and James Mansfield, and we're having a residency at Degree Art, a gallery in East London in September and October 2014. We are raising funds to pay for some of the installation that we plan to create – which will be a 12ft by 8ft log cabin within the gallery space.
The concept for the show is that we will create an installation which provides an insight into the life of a modern-day explorer who decided to build a log cabin in a patch of wasteland somewhere in London. At some point, the explorer disappeared, and the cabin was discovered.
The viewer will be presented with an interactive installation consisting of the cabin and its contents. Through a series of narratives consisting of objects and artworks, visitors will be drawn into the explorer's life and be able to form their own interpretations of why the explorer built the cabin as well as reasons for their mysterious disappearance.
Who are we?
We are a group of four artists
Estella Castle 
Mark Morgan
Martha Beaumont 
James Mansfield
We met while studying at City and Guilds of London Art School in Kennington in 2012/13 and have since been working both on our individual practices as well as together in preparation for this show. We are interested in a similar range of ideas – about the construction of fictions and artifices, as well as the influence of having lived in the countryside for large periods of our lives.
For this project, we were inspired by tales of explorers from the 19th century, who went to places like the Arctic as well as pioneers who went and lived in inhospitable parts of Canada and Alaska. Bringing this to 2014, we thought it would be great to build our own log cabin and recreate this kind of experience.
So what do we need to raise money for exactly?
We are using Kickstarter to raise money for the installation element of the exhibition, which consist of building a log cabin in the gallery space at Degree Art.
Our estimates are that it will cost around £1850 to buy and transport enough timber (around 30 8 foot logs) to London. We will also be spending around £600 on tools and equipment for the construction of the cabin. We have some funding in place but are now looking to raise around 75% of this cost through Kickstarter and so have an initial target of £2000. If we can exceed this, that would be great.
And this is what you get in return!
We have a range of rewards on offer for donators.
Here are some examples:
For £10 you get a copy of the artist's book and an invitation to the private view.
For £50 you get a small print or sketch by one of us.
For £200 you get a small painting and a small print or sketch by one of us.
For £500 you get a commissioned painting by one of us, where you can choose the subject matter (up to 24 inches square).
We have a separate portfolio website where you can see the artworks which you will receive or you can also have a look at our individual websites above."

  Despite living in a time when more women are speaking up and speaking out about inequality, political issues, and the realities of their day-to-day lives, many continue to be treated as whispers in the void; hidden figures in the dark; shadows on the wall. This is what moved us to launch We Are Not Shadows as the first book from Folkways Press.
When compiling this anthology, we made it our mission to select writing from women of all ages and backgrounds covering a wide range of topics - many of which we feel are both timely and necessary. In We Are Not Shadows, you will find stories, poems, and essays concerning issues of race, gender, sexuality, trauma, adversity, disability, and much more.
This book will feature an extraordinary group of women stepping into the light and sharing their experiences, many of which we're sure you'll either relate to or have your eyes opened by.
Open these pages and listen as Amy Kenny writes on the lack of narratives for people with disabilities, and how disability is a life of erasure as a result.
Walk with Isla Mani through her lines of prose as she recounts abuse at the hands of a loved one and its impact on her identity.
Experience the powerful poetry of Tanatsei Gambura, who delves into the deeply personal exploration of being a woman, being Zimbabwean, being a cite of violence, and becoming an embodiment of resistance.
Just as this book serves as a platform for writers who often go unheard, we also want it to reach out and empower you to stand up and use your voice, even if it shakes.

  Pledges, Funding, and Rewards
  We turned to Kickstarter to launch our first book because we think it is the perfect platform to share these stories with a broad audience and, in pre-ordering copies of our book, it helps us launch more copies than savings alone will allow. This is especially helpful when the company is currently being led by one person (Hannah) and extremely helpful friends and colleagues who donate their time.
What will we use the money for (i.e., where is your money going)?
Author Payment: We believe in paying our authors for their work. So many authors go unpaid in this industry and we want to change that. Funds will also go toward paying any typesetters, designers, proofreaders, and more who are involved in this project.
Printing: Truth is, there is no expense to be spared when it comes to printing, especially if we want to bring you a quality product. And we do! Much of our funding will go toward printing, shipping, and distribution of the books.
Events: This might be a bit harder to manage due to the issues still being caused by the pandemic. However, we want to do what we can to hold events, whether they be virtual or (fingers-crossed) in-person when travel becomes safe. We want to launch this book in a unique way, and we will do what we can to make that happen!
Shipping: Because we want to make this book available to as many readers as we can reach, we also need to have the funds to ship each book and extra reward where it needs to go in a timely and safe manner.
Extra: If we happen to have any funding left over after payments are made, books are printed, and all items are shipped, all money will go back into the company so we can work on bringing you our next book!
Pledges and Rewards
For every pledge you make, depending on the level, you'll receive some great rewards such as:
A copy of the book
Your name listed in the book as a backer
A themed postcard 
A themed bookmark 
A limited-edition enamel pin
And other rewards as thanks for supporting this project! "

671,292077423,"At the end of the 2013-2014 school year, then-juniors Nina Rowan and Kayla McGovern began working endlessly in effort to make their dream of publishing a fashion magazine at Emmaus High School a reality after noticing a lack of fashion-geared activities at Emmaus. 
They since added Kayte Bridger and Emily Yen to the Board of Directors and a 40-person staff to publish a new issue every month on ehsbuzzmagazine.com. 
While the Internet has provided the opportunity to share the magazine with a greater audience, the dream is still to see a glossy-paged, real-life magazine in the hands of all the students in the halls of our school. 
Buzz Magazine currently has over 500 followers on various social media websites and close to 2,000 views on ehsbuzzmagazine.com. The magazine has added an element to the school environment that hadn't before existed. Students can now send in their #OOTD pictures to be featured on the Instagram, and there's a celebration of individual style that used to get swept under the rug. We believe we're giving a place for the kid with big dreams of the Fashion Capital a place to go. A place where heels in school isn't scoffed at, but met with a warm, ""I LOVE your shoes! Where'd you get them?""
Despite the large following Buzz Magazine has garnered, the publication is currently not funded by Emmaus, making the hefty publication price of one issue, $5,000, a very difficult task.
We have done many fundraising events, including bake sales, clothing swaps, scarf sales, and frozen yogurt nights, however in order to publish our magazine by the time we graduate in June, we're going to need a lot more. Selling $0.50 cupcakes isn't cutting it. 
We need YOU!
We are very serious journalism students with dreams of working for an established fashion magazine in the future, and your contributions will help push us all a bit closer to that goal.

675,804652120,"This film is about a teenager named Marcus and his friend Jack who are up to no good, stealing and getting into trouble. They think all they're doing is having fun and playing games, but in actuality, it is much worse. They both need help and they don't know it. As the story progresses, Marcus's meets a Christian classmate who introduces himself, and they become friends. He finds out that his job is to bring Marcus to God, and have him repent for what he has done. Marcus starts to change; however, when everything is about to turn around, things get bad real quick when Jack is in trouble. Marcus finds himself in the biggest predicament of his life, and must turn to God to decide what is right. 
The trailer we put together took three days and a lot of planning. We were able to shoot six chapters of the film, and they all turned out great. We discovered that shooting the trailer proved to be harder to do than actually shooting the movie. We had to cram ten minutes of film into three days. That may not seem like a lot, but it was. Each day consisted of getting up at either five or six in the morning, loading up equipment, traveling to our location, shooting for 10 hours, then going home. It was both tiresome and fun at the same time.
In order to finish the film we need at least $20,000, but our goal is $25,000. Most of the funds will go toward equipment, actors, food for the actors, props, gas, and vehicle rentals. This project will include a lot of stunts and action, including fight scenes, car chases, parkour, and police! The plan is to show this film to churches and film festivals all across the globe, making this a very big and important project.
My team and my church are very confident this project will have a far-reaching impact. We can't wait to see the final outcome! All we need is your support!"

677,1166542222,"Join us now in constructing a workshop in Playa Blanca, Peru, to build small scale wind turbines for houses that are not on the electricity grid - a mini energy revolution powered by you!
We are building this community workshop to be a fully outfitted test center for:
Electrification! building and servicing wind turbines installed in the local area
Education! teaching the community, national students and international volunteers about wind energy, turbine science and mechanics
Engineering! developing and testing new turbine system designs
Providing power to Playa Blanca
  Learning, building, experimenting together
The Wind Workshop - Why and How
Around 37% of Peru's rural population does not have a connection to the electricity grid. In remote areas a connection is difficult and expensive; the alternatives of running diesel generators and using candles are costly, dangerous for health, and pollute.
Communities are rightly demanding energy, and the chance to get it sustainably - Peru is already suffering the direct impacts of climate change. Luckily much of Peru has plenty of sun for solar generation, and large areas ideal for wind generation. For the last 10 years, WindAid has been working to electrify rural communities with wind energy. This type of local renewable electricity is easy and quick to install and has a clear and measurable impact for the recipients.
We now have over 50 wind turbines installed in coastal communities from Piura in the north, to Lima on the central coast and across the Peruvian Andes from Cajamarca to Huaraz. Check out our turbine map: http://www.windaid.org/about-us/windaid-impact/
We have many projects to install more turbines in our work plan, but we are limited by what we can do in our Trujillo workshop to build and maintain them. It can take us over 12 hours to travel to the site of a turbine, even after we have been able to arrange for a group to go. We identified that a network of regional hubs would help in various ways:
Having facilities close to installations to build new turbines and do maintenance
Provide adequate accommodation for volunteers on site to allow for longer stays to get more done
Be a training center for a local technician(s), who can diagnose and fix minor problems and eventually be capable of fabricating turbine systems and help us develop and test new designs
Talking about this idea with our friends in Playa Blanca, we decided the village would be the ideal site to build our first community workshop. A plan formed that we are now ready to make it reality!
The Wind Workshop - Design and Construction
The Playa Blanca Wind Workshop has a modern design but also fits in with the surrounding buildings. It will be made principally using bamboo as a local renewable resource for durability and natural beauty, and other locally-sourced materials.
It will accommodate up to 20 workers throughout the day, with dormitories to sleep up to 12. Therefore the design needs to provide versatility as rooms can change from work spaces to sleeping quarters for local community members and visiting project volunteers.

We are taking care to make the building as low impact as possible on this delicate coastal ecosystem, and will showcase the benefits of these features to our neighbors:
Grey water being reused for vegetable garden irrigation
Washroom waste being composted into fertilizer
Wind turbines for electricity
Solar hot water heaters
A rooftop vegetable garden
The workshop will serve as the WindAid Institute base of operations in the Playa Blanca area, where we will build the wind generators, develop models specific to their needs, and test and adopt the most advanced wind turbine designs.
Playa Blanca at Sunset
A History of Playa Blanca and WindAid Institute
Playa Blanca is a small village on the beautiful desert coast of Northern Peru. It was founded nearly a half a century ago as a permanent home for the fishermen and women that made a living from the abundant sea life in the rich waters.
Today there are over 60 families, two schools, a restaurant, a shop, a community centre and a church. However, it still has little infrastructure, including no access to grid electricity.
View of the Bay
  The Fishing Boats of Playa Blanca
But this small community wants energy to power their lives, and will accept nothing less than a sustainable solution that leaves them free from dependence upon an unreliable and expensive grid-connection.
WindAid Institute has been working with Playa Blanca towards this goal since 2012, installing different turbines, running workshops, and testing system add-ons.
Raising a Turbine in Playa Blanca
In 2014 we decided together on a long-term sustainable model:
Installing a small autonomous wind turbine for every house in Playa Blanca. We now have 15 systems, with plans to have up to 40 - for every family that wants one. They use the energy for lights; charging mobile phones and batteries; and powering televisions, small fridges, and cooking appliances such as blenders.
Creating a permanent facility in the village to service, maintain, and replace them independently. The community has provided the land, and we have marked out the plot.
Now let’s build!

Build Phases
We are spending a fortnight in Playa Blanca this month (June) to install the support beams and erect the temporary walls and roof for the living area. We would love it if you followed our progress to cheer us on.
Phase One
This Kickstarter event is to enable us to complete the first phase of the build, through to November 2016. We will be:
Installing all remaining support beams
Putting in inner divisions, wiring the living area, and running water (non-potable)
Installing a turbine to provide power to the center
Finalizing the room divisions
Improving the walls, making the roof walk-worthy
Creating a dust free room for electronics
Phase Two
The second phase will be done by January 28 2017, when we will install a second turbine, additional tooling & equipment in the workshop, and put in all the remaining amenities in the kitchen, bathroom, bedrooms and living room so we are ready to take full project teams to site. We are offering the opportunity to join us to complete the Wind Workshop, and to attend the grand unveiling!

Building materials $22,000
Tools and equipment to fit out workshop $8,600
Travel, food, and accommodation for build phase one $4,400
Meet the team
Over the time we are building the workshop, a lot of volunteers and WindAid Institute staff, as well as community members will be involved in some way. We’d like to introduce you to key people on the team:
Nicholas Warren - Nick helped found WindAid Institute. His enthusiasm and ability to make every day fun brings a lot of laughter to the team.

Example - Ford GT40 1966 1/12 Scale.
___________________________________________________________
Over 1000* scale models with technical and historical explanations**.  
From the Machines of Leonardo Da Vinci to Today a journey in evolution from the origin of the idea to the last concept  
Studied for the general public, school visits and families  
Visitors to the museum will be able to see:
Museum Section:  
Cars, Motorcycles, Trucks, civil and racing
 Example - Fiat 500 scale 1/12
Example - Motorcycle scale 1/9
Example - McLaren F1 Scale 1/20
___________________________________________________________
With the same precision we will make every model to complete the museum by creating models of:
Civil Aviation and Aerospace Aircraft
Military Vehicles: Tanks, Planes, Helicopters and Ships, Uniformed Soldier   
Trains and buses  
Example static Train 1/87
Work vehicles, police and Fireman vehicles and Taxi of the world
Vehicle used in most famous movie and action figure
And much more.
*  The number of models exhibited will increase in relation to what has been collected and continuously over the years.
**  The scales of the models on display will be from 1/2 to 1/1600
Why Bologna ?
Bologna located in a strategic point north central Italy Important tourist destination important railway and airport station and primary highway. At the heart of the Motor Valley near automotive and motorcycle industries (Ferrari Lamborghini Pagani Maserati Ducati ...) Militarily theater of important battles a few steps from the gothic line and protagonist of the liberation during the second world war.
Almost all scale models will be assembled, painted and dioramas by myself and by the team that I will create, professional builders, miniaturists of international renown, others will come from private collections and scale models of excellent prestige on the market.

679,1099475068,"What's the deal with Jeffrey Bloom?
A seemingly normal guy with good intentions, Jeff has nothing but admiration for his college sweetheart, Laura. Or does he? After moving in with Laura, he can't help but question every move.
A narrative short, Inside Boxes explores the psychology of a man whose fears ultimately take over his life. Unfortunately for Jeff that may just be the undoing for the relationship he has with Laura.
This is mine (Paul Lazo) and Michelle Kwong's BFA thesis film. It's a dramatic comedy about moving in and falling out.
Inside Boxes will be shooting mid-June and we need your help to make it happen. We're looking to create a ""different"" kind of movie that ultimately tackles issues of social anxiety not by examining the problem itself by saying ""he's bi-polar"" or ""he's crazy"" but by creating a visual narrative that show how these kinds of problems affect interpersonal relationships.
We need your help to do the following:
1. HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION  - A lot of our cast and crew are traveling from out of town and we'll be navigating the entire metro-Boston area for our shoot. With your help we'll be sure to keep our crew mobile.
2. EQUIPMENT - We'll be renting lenses, G&E equipment and other assorted goods. Your donations will literally put our images into motion.
3. PRODUCTION DESIGN - We're looking to create very cluttered spaces and your donations will help dirty our frames. Boxes are surprisingly expensive believe it or not. Donations like yours will make our film's design flawless and pretty.
4. CONTINGENCY - Things go wrong sometimes. People are late, someone forgets the batteries. With contingency money, we'll have spare money just in case something goes crazy.

Meet the Team
Paul Lazo - Director

Paul Lazo is best known in the Emerson community as the director of a number of multi-camera television shows (Amped!, Musicians Wanted, Unsportsmenlike Conduct) and Emerson's go-to Script Supervisor (Monarch, How to Make a Nightmare, The Whistler). Now he hopes to place his mind back into his major by creating this movie Inside Boxes.
Paul Lazo loves writing weird and compelling stories. As a kid, he would often write books and share them with friends. Growing up he found himself writing normal situations in abnormal ways, leading to some very strange and unique pieces. He loves creating art on 16mm film melding inks onto film emulsion. What he appreciates most about film making is that it allows you to let someone view the world through your eyes.
A piece Paul and Brad created last semester entitled Speak is free to watch on YouTube.
Last summer he had the pleasure of working as a Script Supervisor on the independent feature Theory of Conflict which is currently in post-production. He has also script supervised a number of Emerson BFAs and BAs. 
He's the Visual Media Arts Bill Bordy Scholarship recipient for 2013-2014 and takes a lot of pride and commitment into all that he does. He enjoys bad television, pizza and indie rock. He hopes to work either on set or in the studio after college.
Michelle Kwong - Director of Photography
Michelle Kwong is a twenty-one-year-old BFA cinematography major and photography minor from Long Island, New York expecting to graduate Emerson College in the spring of 2015. With a passion and interest in visual imagery, Michelle believes that film and photography are mediums that allow her to create stories and convey thoughts, ideas, and emotions she was never able to do with just words.
During her time at Emerson, Michelle has participated on various sets within the lighting and camera departments in order to hone her skills as a cinematographer. These skills have allowed her to get a taste of the professional industry by working on sets such as Mania Days, starring Katie Holmes and executive produced by Spike Lee, and the feature length version of the short film, Curfew, the winner of the 2012 Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film. Michelle has also created several short films in the past that have been recognized by various film festivals, such as I'm Not Even That (2009) that was screened at the 2010 New York Asian American International Film Festival and 11th Annual DC Asian Pacific American Film Festival, and Weirdo Records (2013) that was screened at the 2013 Ballston Spa Film Festival and chosen to be screened at the 2014 Salem Mass Reality Check Film Festival.
You can view Michelle Kwong's reel on Youtube.
Aside from being the director of photography for her and Paul Lazo's collaborative BFA thesis film, Inside Boxes, that will be shooting this upcoming summer, Michelle has recently finished shooting the BFA thesis film, Fairy Tale, and is currently the director of photography for two BA Capstones shooting in March.
Michelle continues to develop her skills as a cinematographer and make her dream of becoming a filmmaker a reality.

Production & Delivery Timeline
Meet the Founder
Founded in 2014, Victory Chimp began life as the creative outlet of Northern Irish freelance designer, illustrator and bike rider, Ryan O'Reilly. When not busy at his desk, Ryan would either be scribbling down his own ideas or riding around the country on his bike. When the latter started exerting an overwhelming influence on the former, Victory Chimp was born. One crash and several weeks away from both bike and computer later, Ryan had plotted a course through the (mostly imagined) intersections of art, cycling, fashion and the great apes.
What people are saying...
""WOW! It's freaking gorgeous"" - Womens Kit
""I think Victory Chimp have done a fantastic job on their first clothing collection, I want the whole lot of it!"" - Dave Smith, Velocity & Vitality
""Ryan’s unique art style and colours stand out from a sea of corporate magnolia."" - ADVNTR.CC
""Big fans of these guys. Great that they are looking to expand into kit."" - Casquette
""I appreciate any piece of apparel that puts banana storage first and foremost"" - Rhys Howell
""They are all ace! Actually cannot decide which I like best"" - Matthew
""Beautiful kit, can’t wait to wear it"" - Anna
""These are so good man, so difficult to choose!"" - Simon
Returns/Exchanges
We want to bring you cycling art and apparel that you love, so if for any reason you're not happy with your purchase, we'll put it right.
A detailed sizing and design/colour survey will be sent after the campaign ends to confirm pledges before shipping, but if you receive your kit items and would prefer a different size, we will be more than happy to exchange as required.

681,1593724100,"Dear Adventurers,
Hello! It’s me, Clara. I am the author.
Jenny is the Illustrator.

Together, we are bringing to life the true imaginings from my childhood. Why? Because of our sons.
Jenny’s son, Easton is 8 years old. My son, Rufus is 8 Months old. Jenny and I want to leave a legacy for our sons. A legacy that will create a wave of inspiration, adventure, and imagination for our sons and other children everywhere, to surf. And of course we want the time and freedom to surf that wave with them. Our hope is that this book (and others to follow) will lend us that freedom!
Easton has been our biggest cheerleader. He loves the story, loves his mom, loves Rufus, and will do anything to help this book succeed. He entertains Rufus, poses for our pictures, and delivers honest feedback. And Rufus adores Easton.
It all started when I (Clara) was a kid in the 90’s. My two best friends, Erica and Natalie, and I went on adventures all around the world. We were wolves, archeologists, professional fort builders, explorers, spies, and dragon hunters. Every day after school we would play till the sun went down.
Hunting Dragons was a neighborhood favorite. We had a lengthy list of local dragons that needed our protection. Such as the sidewalk dragon, the tree dragon, sky dragon, rose dragon, car dragon… you get the idea.
Unfortunately, we all grew up. For a while, I let myself fall into the idea that I needed to retire my childhood imagination. Even though it had been my salvation.
When I learned I was pregnant with my son, I realized how silly it was to put those stories in a box. My husband encouraged me to write one of the stories down. That is when ‘Today We Are Dragon Hunters’ came to life!
Little did I know it would launch me into a dream of becoming a children's book author! The only problem? Illustrating.
One fate filled evening I went to a women's entrepreneurial book club meeting in the cozy mountain town of Bozeman, Montana. The leader of the group asked us all to share our dreams. A nice blonde lady, named Jenny, said she dreamed of being an artist. She said that she loved painting depictions of rocks, which I found very intriguing. When it was my turn, I shared that I had written a story and I dreamed of being an author but lacked artistic abilities.
Thus a friendship was forged!
We exchanged words, phone numbers, and a plan. Since then we have been working together to bring this story to life for you!
Jenny and I chose to use Kickstarter because we believe in our book. We believe that adults and children will love it as much as we do. We believe that despite the many distractions, activities, and video games available to kids of all ages, we all need time for imagination and play.
The funds donated to this campaign will help us fulfill ours, and Easton’s, dreams. They will go to publishing, marketing, and distributing our book to libraries, schools, and book stores.
Jenny and I put our heads together to compile a list of book stores, libraries, and other places we would like to see our book.
Your donation will go toward making this happen.
A Grass Dragon Spotting
Thank you for your support! You are helping our dreams come true!"
682,894764805,"Kindling is a short social drama following protagonists, Alexia (30) and Kat (32), a lesbian couple who are trying to start a family together. After Alexia’s miscarriage and news that she is unable to conceive, the couple become distant. Their relationship is on the brink until they come across an abandoned baby in the woods. After deciding to bring the baby home, they put off calling the police and instantly grow attached to the child; caring for her as if she was their own. The baby allows the couple to bond again and imagine what life would have been like if Alexia had not miscarried. 
Excerpt from page 3 of Kindling
  The look of the film will be organic and natural, with soft lighting and delicate camera movement - representing the ever-changing dynamic of Alexia and Kat's relationship.

684,1795605870,"Imagine being able to control our telescopes to explore the sky in both hemispheres from the comfort of your living room. Go from the heart of the Milky Way to the Clouds of Magellan, sail by the sun and past the planets of our solar system.
Stargazers is a project dedicated to making astronomy and astrophotography available to everyone. We plan to create a network of high-grade telescopes around the world and let you steer them in the easiest and most natural way: from the tip of your fingers.  
Last news !!
We are pleased to announce that everything is almost ready to build our first site. 
To celebrate this milestone, we are honored to offer to all Kickstarter backers an exclusive lifetime access to this R&D site. Only you will have the opportunity to book for free this site while it will not be in use by our technical team. 
Would you like to know more? check news N°5
Contemplating the sky is always wonderful and stress-free. The view gives us an insight into the world in which we live. Throughout the ages, the sky has always inspired humanity.  
Stargazing doesn’t require much to start with. The first instrument can be your bare eyes, except if you’re living in a city with so much light pollution that the stars are barely visible, or if your weather is not cooperating.  
With Stargazers App, you are no longer limited by local conditions. Select one of our international sites, and then watch live-streaming video from its telescope. No matter the time of day or the weather!
 If you want to get more involved in astronomy, add binoculars or even a telescope to your explorations. You can also add a camera for more details and deeper sky observations.  
We encourage you to join an astronomy group near your home. They’ll help you improve your skills. Imagine getting to share your love of the stars with others! We encourage you to share your explorations! You can instantly upload photos from our Stargazers App to your favorite form of social media.  
With Stargazers App, you will add to your starwatching skills. Because our telescopes are in different hemispheres, you can see and show sky wonders at any time. Just travel instantly to the other side of the planet to contemplate the skies.
With the Stargazer App, you can book time on a remote observatory. Each 12-inch diameter telescope is fully equipped with a high-end digital camera for astrophotography and assisted with an 80mm apochromatic refractor. Our system is also equipped with a cooled camera. This hardware is under your control on your remote device, such as a tablet, from Stargazers App.  
Our goal is to create a seamless system that is as natural and easy to use as possible. Use our star map to find a feature or point to a location and click. Our telescope will automatically move to this position. Our cameras are ready to take photographs at your discretion. You can also choose a space object from a pre-programmed list, such as a nebula, our sun (during daytime), or a planet. Our telescope will move automatically into the selected position. You can also just use the camera feedback and point to a location or use our directional pad to change your target.  
All the complex technology is hidden behind the scenes and maintained by a team of experts!

 Even the Experts Follow Us
 The Stargazers App Journey
 The Genesis of Stargazer
In 2014, Philippe Lopes Pinto, Stargazer App’s Co-Founder & Chief Executive, invited friends to dinner. One of his friend’s daughters saw his telescope and asked if she could look through it. Unfortunately, the weather wasn’t cooperating. Philippe met up again with his friends few months later, but this time, it was too late for the girl to observe the sky. It occurred to Philippe to build a set of telescopes worldwide so people could observe the sky no matter their location or time zone.
 The Proof of Concept
The first step of developing the Stargazer App was to enumerate what our solution was supposed to do. We then needed to see if our idea would work on any device, like a tablet or smartphone. Our critical steps on this qualitative approach were:
Capturing, editing, and streaming a video from a specialized camera.  
Steering a telescope using a high-grade mount directly from a tablet. 
Managing the power supply and equipment status. 
Preserving the local environment. If possible, we pick sites located in isolated places away from city lights and pollution. Astronomers care about the health of their observation places. As a result, we rely on solar panels and batteries anywhere there is no available electrical grid.
Having enough bandwidth to meet our needs.
Implementing fully automated behavior of the hardware and software to preserve the site’s integrity. For instance, in case of bad weather conditions, the dome should be able to shut itself down.  Integrating all electronic equipment with our own software so we can handle every unexpected situation, without being limited by manufacturer’s software. This means that, unlike most remote solutions for personal use, we do not rely on stacking existing software. We have built our own complete solution from scratch.
Making our solution available remotely with limited latencies (time lags).
Our plan required that every single step described above had to be successfully tested. Otherwise, the project would have stopped immediately. Using separate software, we have tested every component.
All the hardware, such as our cameras and mounts must have an exposed API or driver so that we could create our own software from scratch.
We’ve also tested the video streams captured from several cameras. We ensured that we could combine the different videos and restream them to your mobile device.
Finally, we also tested automated aspects to help us choose which platform was best fitted to our needs. According to these tests, we can use both a microcontroller and an embedded computer. This will allow us to use each to its best advantage.
A Well-Advanced UI App  
The user interface (UI) has been designed to be as friendly as possible. Every command is easily accessible, and as understandable as possible for ages 9 to 99. It is “fluent” which means every action is accessible with minimum steps. Our goal is to make astronomy accessible to everyone so no prior knowledge of astronomy is required. If you can point and touch, you can use this system. More experienced astronomers will be able to focus on observations and retrieve session files for post-treatment.
This video shows you how to use an iPad to select an observatory site using Stargazer App and get quick information. The video was captured in real time on a 9.7” iPad Pro.
Our First Observatory Sites: Australia and Europe 
For astronomy observations, time lag is crucial! This is particularly true when we decided to offer daytime steering. That’s why we’ve selected remote sites in Australia and Europe.  
In Australia, you can marvel at the southern sky within the heart of the Milky Way. This location is located three and a half hours from Melbourne in Victoria State. It is in a remote area far from light pollution. Our host and caretaker is very involved in astronomy. This enthusiast will take care of our installation. He already has two domes installed! We will be completely autonomous with solar panels and 4G for communications.
In Europe, we opted for the Saint-Véran site, an observatory built in the mid-60s in Provence (France). Saint-Véran is a unique and fantastic location far away from light pollution. The observatory is located at 2940m (9,650 feet) and offers a very pure and dark sky. This observatory is already well known and valued by the astronomy community. We are very proud to be able to make it available for you, soon.
The people of Saint-Véran are very enthusiastic about the project and love the idea of sharing their beautiful sky with the rest of the world.

 Stargazers App plans
 Why Kickstarter?
Kickstarter is a way to raise capital through donations. Through Kickstarter, we won’t lose company control as we might through investors. Kickstarter donors will help us complete our minimum requirements before we launch the Stargazers App. Funds will help us complete both iOS and Android applications for tablets and our first telescope site.  
We’ve already started or completed parts of our Stargazer.Space project. We will offer ten observation sites worldwide. Each takes time to get local authorizations, so we have lined up these sites already. As a result, we know we have the best possible sites for very dark skies for the highest quality of astronomical viewing.  
Each site requires individualized testing and modification of both software and hardware. We are working to ensure that each site will respond to specific weather and power challenges.  
The core R&D parts of our project are completed. Our next goal is to create infrastructure and the tools that you, our supporter, needs. We wrote software for iOS first, but we expect make it available for Android, as well. To achieve this, we must port the software to Android devices.  
Our back-office uses Microsoft Azure as the backbone of the infrastructure. All our databases, websites, web services, and application logging will be seamlessly hosted on Azure.  
We already have the telescopes, cameras, and supporting hardware. All we need for this part of the project are a 32 sqft (3m2) dome and solar panels.  
Thanks to your support, our first site will be ready to take you to the stars. Future sites are ready to be completed and added to our system as our funding continues.
What Happens with Any Extra Contributions?  
Our initial campaign will complete our first installations in Australia and France. The complete Stargazers App project will host ten telescopes installed across the world. It is the minimum infrastructure that will allow anyone, anywhere, access to the whole sky surrounding the earth at any time... as promised!  
We want ten telescopes not only for complete sky viewing but to keep as many telescopes up and functioning despite locally bad weather or maintenance. We also want to ensure that there are enough telescopes for every subscriber to have convenient steering sessions. Eventually, we plan to add extra telescopes to each site.  
Each site costs between $80,000 and $140,000. Extra contributions will help us bring our dream to fruition that much sooner."

688,1561341764,"I completed this portrait of Donald Trump - one of the largest I've ever painted - shortly before the presidential election.  I really didn't think he would win.  Since painting it, it has exhibited only once.  It has mostly remained hidden, save for the many times that I've posted the image online; via Instagram or Facebook, but most often directly to Donald Trump's own Twitter page.  I think it only appropriate that it be shipped directly to the White House for Trump and his wonderful staff to marvel at daily.  I cannot afford the shipping costs by myself - it measures 36""x48"" and is made of heavy wood paneling.  It weighs approximately 25 pounds.  I also plan to insure the painting and ship it using the USPS Register mail system - the very shipping method that was used to move the famous Hope Diamond so securely.

689,1034614232,"Firsthand Weather has seen growth unlike anything we have ever experienced in the history of the site. By putting out accurate forecasts, we have been able to exponentially grow our audience, and while that is definitely not a bad thing, our costs have gone up as a result. Our goal is to raise enough money to fund an app and also allow for a bigger audience by upgrading our hosting plan. The goal is to do a larger fundraiser later this year, but right now, we need to raise at least $500 to kickstart our project. We need to cover some initial costs before we can fully dive into our bigger projects later in the year. 
Our goal has always been to keep Firsthand Weather free. We desire for our site to grow and to offer other services and mobile applications at no cost to you. Our main objective is to get our forecasts out to more people and improve the Firsthand Weather experience by providing accurate and quality forecasts.  
The first $500 will be used to upgrade our hosting, and any money in addition to what is raised will be put towards developing an app for iPhone and Android devices. Also, money will go towards improving the Firsthand Weather website and introducing new services that are currently not available. 
We believe that if enough people come together, we can make this happen!! We're not asking for $500 a person donations, but simply are asking for small donations generally between $1 and $5.

690,150493278,"The maternity golf clothes line chip shot is the most commonly used chip shot in the game of golf – while the technique is not fancy, this shot is generally a smart play and gets the job done.
Who I Am
I’m a busy working mom from Minneapolis, MN who loves to play golf. When I was pregnant with my daughter, Scarlett, in 2012, I realized that maternity golf clothes designed to be worn on the course simply did not exist! When several of my golfing friends – also currently in the “breeding phase of life” – complained about the same issue, I decided to solve the problem. I’m asking for your help in funding this Kickstarter project to help produce the first line of maternity active wear designed exclusively for golf.
Where I Am Today
I have spent the last several months designing and refining the initial Maternity golf collection, which consists of a golf skort and a short-sleeved golf shirt. The clothing is designed to address strict dress rules while being comfortable, so players can focus on their game, not adjusting their clothing after each swing.
The golf shirt is designed to be form fitting and will be made of athletic clothing that stretches to accommodate a growing belly. Since you won't want to tuck the shirt into a bottom with a belly support band, the bottom is designed to be worn on the outside.
The golf skort has a comfortable inseam with built-in shorts and pockets to hold scorecards and tees. Best yet, the skort stays in place when you swing due to the built-in belly band. The belly band is designed to fold over, which means the skort can also be worn post pregnancy.
Where You Come In
I am looking for at least $5,000 to fund:
Completion of the design work, including physical samples and final patterns in multiple sizes;
Creation of Shopify website, including photography, where the line will be exclusively sold; and
Initial manufacturing of a small order of product to “get the golf ball rolling”
In return for your support you will receive recognition on our to-be-created website or other items, such as first-run production of Maternity Golf Clothes Line clothing, an invitation to our launch party or a round of golf at the famed Minikahda Club in Minneapolis, MN.
Funds raised above the target amount will be used towards adding additional products. When you donate to my campaign, don't be afraid to let the big dog eat!

691,972702484,"Hunnyball™ is a new game. We think it could be a great one. But like all games, its only as good as its players. And we want you to be one. Pre-order now, get the best deal we can offer, and help us make this game real.

The Game
If you're like us, you love beach games, and you've played most of them - traditional sports, like volleyball, and familiar favorites, like Spikeball and Crossnet, to name a few. Hunnyball is similar - the goal is to make a ball hit the ground, and it makes you happy when you do. It's the quick reactions, the difficulty, the crazy plays, and the competition that keep you coming back. Hunnyball has all that. Turns out a ball, a board, and a fear of losing are all you need to make some highlights. What makes Hunnyball different is the creativity that comes from passing/defense. It feels like a sport you can study. Every time we play, we learn something new - cut to drag a defender out of position; if they follow, shoot into the empty space; if they hold, pass for an easier shot. On defense, let them pass backwards, but never forwards. And it only gets more interesting when you add more players or boards. It's easy to have fun, and fun to get better. 

Our Goal and Promise
Our goal is simple...
We want to bring some fun into the world. And games give us all one more reason to get together with friends and family to enjoy the present. Hunnyball is not the first game we've thought of, but it is the first game that we truly believe is worth sharing.

Our promise is also simple...
If you help us reach our goal, we will get this product to you. There are no more open questions. No more blockers. We've done the prototyping, finished the design, and found the suppliers. All we need is your support, and you will have helped our family reach our life-long goal of creating something together. For that, keeping our promise is the least we could do. 

The Team
I'm Kevin Halliday, pictured above with my younger (and shorter) brother Nick, next to our best looking prototype. We began working on Hunnyball back in the summer of 2019, with our older brother Zach, and father Jim. We used to play different variations of Hunnyball growing up - using a football against a rebounder, juggling a soccer ball against a wall, or playing with lacrosse sticks, a lacrosse ball, and a lax wall. Some versions were not great, some were fun, the one we have now is the best. Just after graduating college, Nick decided to turn that childhood hobby into an adult one. Below you can see our favorite family member Hunny, who the game is named after, reffing an early youngest vs oldest game.

Our Timeline 
The Rules
Teams  
Split yourselves up into two teams of two.
Serving  
Pick a player. Have them take a shot from the outfield boundary, aiming for the center board. If they hit it, they serve first. If they miss it, the other team serves first.
The server stands in the middle of the field. The team serving is on offense to start; the other team is on defense. When both teams are ready, the server throws the ball at the board, starting the rally.
Rally  
A rally begins with the server's throw. A throw must hit the board, and can result in one of the following:
The rally goes on.  
The ball hits the board, and is caught by team on defense. The team on defense is now on offense, and vice versa.
 The rally ends.  
The ball misses the board.
The ball hits the board, and lands out of bounds.
The ball hits the board, and lands in bounds.
Offense  
A team is on offense when they are serving, or when they catch the ball after the opposing team's shot. A shot is any throw made by an offensive player with the intent to hit the board. A pass is any throw intended for one's teammate. The offensive team is allowed two passes, before having to take a shot.
After completing a catch, the offensive player with the ball may not take any steps. They may, however, take steps while completing a catch. They may also move around a single pivot foot. A single step is allowed if stepping into a shot or pass. They may also step into a jump shot or pass, as long as they complete the throw before landing.
The official rule is that you can only hold the ball for a max of 5 seconds. After 5 seconds, the player with  the ball must shoot from where they stand. If you're playing seriously,  we recommend you enforce this rule. If not, feel free to ignore it.
Defense  
A team is on defense when the opposing team is on offense. The defense may knock down any pass the offense tries to make. This ends the rally. The defense may not block any clear shots made by the offense. If it is not clear whether a blocked throw was a pass or shot, redo the point. If an offensive player wants to make it clear they are going to shoot, rather than pass, they can say ""shot"" out loud. After a player announces their shot, the offense can no longer pass, and the defense can no longer block. After a shot, the defense must catch the ball before it lands in bounds.
Scoring  
You can only score when it is your serve. This makes changes of possession important. A change of possession refers to a switch of the team that's serving.
The result of a rally depends on how it ends:
The ball misses the board.  
 Serving team's shot - change of possession.
 Other team's shot - point for the serving team.
The ball hits the board, and lands out of bounds.  
 Serving team's shot - change of possession.
 Other team's shot - point for the serving team.
The ball hits the board, and lands in bounds.  
 Serving team's shot - point for the serving team.
 Other team's shot - change of possession.
The defense knocks down an offensive pass.  
 Serving team's pass - change of possession.
 Other team's pass - point for the serving team.
The defense blocks an offensive shot.  
If the block was unintentional, or if it was not clear if the throw was a shot or a pass, the rally should be restarted. If the block was intentional, or if the thrower had announced their shot:
 Serving team's shot - point for the serving team.
 Other team's shot - change of possession.
Games are played to 11, win by 2.

For Consideration  
You may find you prefer rally scoring (in which a point is scored after each rally, regardless of serve). If you do choose rally scoring, consider playing games to 21.
Try playing three on three, or four on four. If you do increase the team size, try moving the outfield boundary.
If you are cool enough to have two Hunnyball sets, try playing with two boards - one facing the other. Join the two boundaries at the end of the sidelines. Both teams can use either board to score.
Note: We created these rules based on our favorite way to play Hunnyball.  Feel free to follow them exactly, or adjust them. Play however you like. That said, our goal is to eventually have tournaments, and at those tournaments our rules will reign supreme. Everyone knows you always play house rules.

692,1796915224,"  On s’est souvent choqué face aux infos, en écoutant des débats ou de simples personnes discutant à la caisse du supermarché : stigmatisation, généralisation, stéréotypes et parfois, violence, agressivité gratuite ou autres actes dictés par l’ignorance… Quels que soient la cause, le sujet, le débat : c’est frustrant. Frustrant de voir des personnes suivre un mouvement, d’adopter des idées sans chercher à comprendre, et encore moins apprendre.
Nous sommes trois jeunes femmes et avons conçu le projet Work to Gather pour lutter contre les idées reçues et ainsi favoriser une prise de conscience menant à l’acceptation de l’autre dans sa différence. 
Pour cela, nous avons choisi un sujet sensible qui fait effectivement la une des média et alimente bien des discussions. En effet, nous avons grandi dans un monde où l’Islam est constamment stigmatisée et représentée de manière négative par les médias. 
Comme beaucoup, nous avons constaté à quel point la simplification et la généralisation des discours médiatiques ont contribué à la construction d’amalgames et au renforcement des stéréotypes dans l’imaginaire collectif favorisant ainsi le développement de l’islamophobie. 
Aujourd’hui, de façon naïve, nous nous posons une question : pourquoi sommes-nous incapables de vivre ensemble, de coexister, d’aller au-delà de nos différences et de nous voir les uns et les autres simplement comme des êtres humains ? 
Voulant sincèrement comprendre l’état d’esprit de chacun et répondre à cette question, nous filmons un documentaire appelé Togæther – une contraction de Together (ensemble) et To Gather (se rassembler) – sur la perception des musulmans aux Etats-Unis. 
Les attentats du 11 septembre ont marqué un tournant géopolitique majeur dans l'histoire de l'humanité et ont bouleversé la représentation de l'Islam et des musulmans en occident. C'est pour cette raison précise que nous avons ressenti le besoin de traverser l'atlantique pour réaliser ce documentaire. 
À travers ce projet, nous rencontrerons des personnes de toutes confessions religieuses et de tous milieux. Nous ferons des interviews, des portraits ; nous écouterons leurs perspectives, leurs points de vue et expériences ainsi que leurs anecdotes. Nous sommes conscientes que nous vivons tous dans des réalités différentes. Chacun de nous voit le monde à travers son propre regard subjectif. Nous interprétons la vie, l'histoire, les événements et l'actualité à travers le prisme de la réalité dans laquelle nous sommes ancrés. Dans ce documentaire, nous allons à la rencontre de musulmans et non-musulmans pour découvrir leurs réalités. Notre but principal est de construire des ponts entre les personnes, d'apporter une autre perspective dans leurs vies et de promouvoir des valeurs que nous considérons vitales pour notre futur : la tolérance et la coexistence. 
Ce documentaire se base sur l'idée que nous sommes tous liés les uns aux autres par notre humanité. Nous tenons avant tout à diffuser un message universel qui est de choisir en toutes circonstances le respect, la coexistence, la tolérance et la paix pour tous les êtres humains, quelle que soit leur religion, leur origine ou leur sexualité. Nous créons ce en quoi nous croyons alors autant croire et rêver à la lumière et à une humanité qui permet au meilleur de l’homme de se réaliser.
Au 1er juin 2016, cela fait déjà un mois que nous sommes installées à New York, berceau du melting-pot, où nous avons déjà eu la chance de nous entretenir avec des citoyens de tous quartiers et milieux, de rencontrer des personnalités telles que Sally (""Salwa"") Shatila Kader qui est présidente et co-fondatrice de la Fédération aux Etats-Unis pour la Paix aux Moyen-Orient, des artistes tels que le rappeur Salim El Bey, l'acteur Abraham Makany qui a joué dans des séries comme Person of Interest, Blindspot ou encore Homeland, de jeunes étudiants de l'association étudiante Muslim-Christian Dialogue, la journaliste Sarah Harvard, et d'autres personnes aux profils divers et variés... 
New-York offre une riche mosaïque culturelle que nous avons pris plaisir à explorer tout au long de ce premier mois. Néanmoins, afin d'enrichir le contenu de notre documentaire nous ne voulons pas nous limiter à la population New-Yorkaise. Pour la suite du projet, nous envisageons donc de rencontrer d'autres anonymes et figures importantes dans d’autres régions des États-Unis (Washington DC, Philaldelphia, Chicago, Los Angeles et San Francisco). 
Le financement Kickstarter sera consacré plus particulièrement aux dépenses que vous pouvez apercevoir sur le camembert ci-dessous pour les prochains mois.
Merci de croire en nous et aux valeurs que nous désirons transmettre à travers ce documentaire. Nous tenons également à vous remercier pour le soutien que vous apporterez au projet.
- English version -
Work to Gather project is an initiative created by three young women who hope to connect people despite their differences.  
To do so we chose to address a particular topic, the perception of Muslims in the US - an issue at the core of one of the most divisive political and media conversation. We have grown up in a world where Islam is stigmatized and portrayed negatively by the mainstream media, witnessed the simplification and generalisation of media discourses around Muslim Faith and watched all of this build up stereotypes conflating Islam and terrorism, causing inherently the development of Islamophobia.  
Today, we would like to ask a naïve question: why are we still incapable of living together, to coexist, unable to see beyond our differences and incompetent to see each other as human beings?
We sincerely want to understand the mindset of each and answer this question, by filming a documentary called Togæther - a contraction Together (together) and To Gather (gather) - on the perception of Muslims in the United States. Through this project, we meet people of all faiths and all backgrounds. We will do interviews, portraits; we will listen to their perspectives, their views and experiences and anecdotes.
We are aware that everyone lives in different realities and to see the world in different lenses is an endless possibility. Each one of us views the world through a prism that reflects our own version of it. Our interpretation of everything we take in, shape our life experiences and biases, both positive and negative; from encounters and relationships to situations and our view of the world. These form our beliefs, values and expectations. However, as a coin has two sides, so does every story. For this documentary, we reach out to Muslims and non-Muslims to uncover their realities.
It's been a month since we are in New York, in a cradle of cultures and melting pot where we had the opportunity to meet people from everywhere and different social classes, as Sally (""Salwa"") Shatila Kader who is a peace activist and currently leads United States Federation for Middle East Peace programs and events at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City and around the world, artist rapper Salim El Bey, actor Abraham Makany (who played in Person of interest, Blindspot, Homeland...), a group of students who are a part of Muslims Christians Dialogue student's union, activist and journalist Sarah Harvard... And many more!
New York has a very diverse cultural mosaic that we enjoy to explore. But we would like to visit other cities to have a better understanding of the perception of Muslims in the US. The next step of this project is to meet more people and peronnalities in other cities as DC, Philadelphia, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Fransisco.
The funding is dedicated to complete our budget for the future trips; plane tickets, accomodation, communication, post production, broadcasting and transport. More details on a pie chart above.
Thank you for believing in us and in the values that we aim at conveying through this documentary which we hope will reach as much as possible. We also want to thank you for the support!

693,2088682423,"Our Story 
Could I breastfeed in this? This is the number one question nursing moms ask themselves before getting dressed. Women should not have to sacrifice style and comfort for functionality! To solve this problem, Le Regard Apparel created The Emery suit and The Lucie dress to provide stylish post-partum clothing with functionality, longevity, class and comfort. These staple pieces simplify women’s lives as professionals, stay-at-home moms, or momtrepreneurs. Being a mom should not hinder your professional life.
Nursing moms struggle to find functional, stylish, and comfortable clothing. As a new mom, I faced that reality – the lack of nursing-friendly attire. Like most moms, I had to return to work outside the home soon after the birth of my daughter. I searched the market for clothing that will cater to the nursing mom’s most pressing need, enable her to breastfeed conveniently, and simultaneously flatter her post-partum body. The clothes I found resulted in either stretched necklines or extra fabric on my baby’s face.

The Emery Suit  
The Emery suit is made for the professional mom. There is no suit like the Emery on the market that provides this utility, style and confidence to the modern mom. Whether a mom, boss lady, corporate executive, or momtrepreneur, fulfill your many duties discreetly and at ease. The buttons on the suit open from the shoulders to the waist, and the bodice drops at the waist to allow for nursing and pumping on the go. You no longer need to worry about difficulty pumping at work. You can also feed your child immediately after getting home. The peplum detail conveniently flatters the post-partum belly. The pants are flowy and widen towards the bottom.

  Why did we decide to run a campaign? 
PLAY

Although it sounds cliché, we believe that every crisis is an opportunity. For us, this is the perfect opportunity to reinvent ourselves. We realized that the education, music, and entertainment industry migrated one hundred percent to the digital world. Even though this switch to digital was already happening before this crisis, we were way too comfortable in our adorable studio in Santa Monica to see this change.
Time to get out of our comfort zone and bring Studio Corazón to the digital world!

Project:  We want to create an easily accessible digital platform for Studio Corazon to share our passion and knowledge for salsa & bachata with the world.
For the development of our platform and the future development of an app, we need to raise a total of 8,000 dollars.
We firmly believe that with everyone's help, we can make this project a reality.
Instead of asking for money, we came up with the idea of creating an exchange: ""our knowledge for your support.""
So we created valuable rewards according to the amount donated that will, for sure, keep your dance training exciting!
VINTAGE DVD's

Proposal: In dance, like in life, every action has an equal reaction.
""Our knowledge for your support!""
We created a course that will help our community to continue connecting with music and dance as a reward for any donation made to our project.
VINTAGE DVD's
Vintage Salsa: The Magic of Salsa is a three-volume course so the user can learn salsa from the basic to the most advanced level. Vintage Salsa Vol.1 Vintage Salsa Vol. 2 Vintage Salsa Vol. 3.
This course is so vintage that you can get it on DVD but no worries you will get a digital version also."
696,103502200,"  Made with Yak fiber from the Tibetan Plateau, and an amazing natural fiber called Tencel, we have engineered three lightweight baselayers that excel in the most extreme environments, and can handle anything you put them through.
As outdoor adventurers we are constantly striving to go further, higher, lighter and faster. Stay warm and comfortable with our yak wool baselayers while you explore the world and push yourself to the limit.
  Peak to Plateau was founded by Stefan Warnaar, a young Kiwi entrepreneur looking to create the World’s Best Baselayers. Stefan first stumbled upon the benefits of yak wool when he spent three months in Mongolia, Central Asia and the Himalayas. He spent his time living with local herders and nomads, surrounded by yaks, goats and sheep.
Realising the huge, untapped potential of yak fiber, Stefan returned home to New Zealand and has since sought to make a difference in the outdoor clothing industry. Peak to Plateau was born and the real journey had just begun.
Inspired by the people living on the Tibetan Plateau and their way of life, we set out to develop yak fiber into outdoor clothing that could outperform anything else on the market, and would allow you to hike, ski, climb or travel in the most extreme and beautiful environments.
By sourcing the fiber directly from the Tibetan Plateau we ensure that we get the best fiber, and the yak herders are guaranteed a fair income. Yak fiber is collected every spring from communities in the North Eastern region of the Tibetan Plateau. The fiber is then cleaned and sorted, and only the superfine 18 micron fiber is used by us.
It has taken 12 months working with the leading suppliers and manufacturers in the industry to develop fabrics and products. Trial runs, developing samples, and months of testing have finally paid off and the results are amazing. Now we are ready to launch our new products, and have big plans for 2017.
  Named after the holiest mountain in Tibet, the Kailash is the first item on the list for any adventurer — whether your hiking, skiing, climbing, mountaineering, or travelling. Wear it all year round under your waterproof jacket, or as your only layer when the sun is out. The 1/4 length zip gives you full control over your temperature, so you can focus on what matters. Say goodbye to the hassle of adding or removing layers when the weather changes.
  Inspired by people always on the move, the Nomad is simple and comfortable, and ready to go wherever you take it. We think of it as a symbol of freedom — the freedom of movement it allows, and the freedom to experience things in our own way. Wear it everywhere you go, whether it is adventuring in the mountains, or relaxing in the hut after a long day.
  The Namtso Tee defies expectations, just like the high altitude Tibetan lake that it's named after. Wear this lightweight, comfortable tee year round thanks to the perfect blend of Yak and Tencel fibers that keep you warm when it's cold, and cool when it's hot. Stay fresh and dry, and always ready for the next adventure.
  With a focus on performance, comfort and style, we started with a tailored cut that functions as well as it fits. We then added raglan sleeves so you can freely move your arms without restriction. Flat seams are used to get rid of chafing, and the seams are placed away from where rubbing occurs (such as under the arms, and on top of the shoulders). An extended torso doesn't ride up and gives extra coverage and warmth. We placed our labels with care, so they stay out of your way and don't itch and scratch.
  Measurements refer to body size, not garment dimensions. If you fall between two sizes, choose the smaller size for a tighter fit or the larger size for a looser fit.
The chest measurement is the most important if you are unsure of your size. The tailored slim fit means that our garments fit men as well as women, however women may want to select the size down from normal (e.g. if you are normally a S you may fit the XS better).
   It all begins with the Yak — evolved to survive at temperatures down to -40 C and altitudes up to 5000 m, and used by nomads on the Tibetan Plateau for centuries. The soft down under-fiber collected every spring is the secret to a yaks ability to get through the winter.
  The perfect fabric is a combination of warmth, breathability, odor resistance, durability and comfort. That is why we have blended yak fiber with Tencel. Our 65% Yak 35% Tencel blend means that we can take advantage of the properties of both fibers, and create a fabric that has never been done before.
  Tencel is softer than silk, stronger than steel and more absorbent than cotton. Made from the fibers of the Eucalyptus tree it has all the properties that make it the perfect choice to blend with Yak — strength, durability, comfort, and breathability. Plus it is produced with an award-winning eco-friendly process.
    By helping us, you are helping the yaks herders we work with, because none of this would be possible without them. Tibetan herders are facing a tough choice — stay and keep their way of life, or leave everything behind for the city — Yak fiber is an opportunity that will keep them connected to their culture and way of life, but also provide a source of income and a connection to the world around them.
We need to reach our target to complete a full manufacturing run. To be able to work with the best manufacturers we need to be able to reach their minimum order quantity. Backing this campaign will ensure that we can get the first of many products into your hands, and continue to work with our yak herding communities.

We have extensively tested our products in New Zealand, which is the perfect testing ground for serious outdoor adventure. Our products have also been worn in Chile, Argentina, the United States, Canada and more. Now you can start wearing Peak to Plateau for all of your adventures and travels.
  Make sure to let others know about our campaign! Thank you for your support, and we can't wait to see you wearing Peak to Plateau.

697,1952966053,"What are you doing?
     We’re making a yearbook and creating future journalists, dynamic leaders, and successful students along the way!!! Yearbooks are a tradition for many middle schools across the country, but that tradition is just beginning at The Pinnacle Charter Middle School this year. Prior to this year the college-prep middle school students had been briefly included in The Pinnacle Charter High School yearbook. But this year is different. For the first time the middle school students at The Pinnacle Charter School in Federal Heights, Colorado, are creating, designing, selling, marketing, and leading the FIRST EVER Pinnacle Charter Middle School (ONLY!!) Yearbook. But we need your help in making this project happen!
Our Cover Sketch
Why is yearbook SO important?
     In a day and age when elective classes are being cut and trimmed from schools, yearbook class remains a great educational experience for all involved. Jostens, a yearbook printing company, has published a list of 30 skills students learn by being a part of yearbook/journalism classes. These include technology skills (business software, desktop publishing, photo-editing software, online design, online research), life skills (communication, leadership, time management, project management, problem solving, writing, photography, teambuilding, conflict resolution, public speaking), journalism skills (concept brainstorming, reporting, researching, copy editing, photo editing, graphic arts, public relations, media law, design), and business skills (budget planning, promotion and advertising, marketing, selling, customer relations, market research).
     These skills will not only help students in middle school, but will carry them into success in high school, college, and beyond. In fact, The Newspaper Association of America in 2008 released a study showing that students who participate in their school’s newspaper or yearbook scored better on college entrance exams and demonstrated better writing and grammar than those who did not.
     The yearbook students also have an opportunity to showcase their artistic, academic, and leadership talents outside of a traditional class and athletics. For many of the 32 staff members, yearbook class is their first taste at creative freedom and leadership. All five of the 8th graders in the class have been given a leadership position this year. For some of them it is their first opportunity to have such great responsibility and earn their peers’ respect.
     In addition to brightening the future of the students involved in yearbook class, the yearbook helps the student body by representing everyone from school in the book. The goal of the Pinnacle Middle School Yearbook staff is to have every middle school student in the book three times. This creates a whole picture of the student body, not simply a snapshot of those most involved. 
How much do you need?
     We’re trying to raise $4,000. This is two-thirds of the total $6,000 we need to produce and print 250+ copies of the yearbook. The 250+ production number is important because this keeps the cost of the yearbooks to $30 per book and will provide a very small reserve to purchase one or two digital cameras for the students to use. We believe, through survey responses from students, many students will purchase a yearbook once printed. However, buying it after it is printed makes it difficult for us to front the money to print the books from our non-existent budget, especially since this is the first year of the class and product.
     The Pinnacle Charter School operates grades kindergarten through 12th grade, with approximately 56 percent of students on free or reduced lunch plans. This means that asking many students to purchase something they have never seen before and do not quite know the value of is asking too much. In the past the middle school students did not have their own yearbook and thus many students did not purchase one. However, through a survey we have discovered that many students want to purchase one this year, but either do not know what a yearbook is or do not have the money. 
     If we are unable to order an adequate number of books, we may have to refund the yearbooks purchased so far and all of the students’ hard work and effort will be for naught. We truly believe with some generous community backing we will be able to produce an amazing book that captures the year and provides students with memories for ever.
What will the money go toward?
     The money raised here will go toward printing the remainder of the unsold 250 copies of the book to keep the costs at $30 per yearbook. These yearbooks will then be sold or given to students determined to be economically unable to afford to purchase one and deserving of one by counselors, administrators, teachers, and peers.
     The money we make back from the sales of the yearbooks, or that remains from this project will be used to purchase cameras for the Pinnacle Middle School Yearbook course. The staff currently has access to only one camera -- a 10-year-old camera that was graciously donated to us – to share among 32 excited student journalists. By being able to purchase more cameras the students will be able to put the photography skills they have learned to use and capture more memories of the student body for the yearbook.
What else can I do to help?
     Pass this along to everyone you know! Every dollar will help us meet our goal and make our class better this year and in the future. You can also donate digital cameras you no longer use or even your time. We could always use volunteers.
Thank you!"

This is a film that has been a year in the making. From conception to writing to plans, to schedules, we are ready to bring this vision to life! The Starlet and The Viper is an independent fiction feature film. The film explores society, living conditions, social structure, and corruption in an American town through the eyes of a 24 year-old woman out for answers. 
This baby right here!
What is The Starlet and The Viper About?
The film follows Grace Idle, a 24 year old woman, as she attempts to uncover the mystery behind her fiance's suicide in this hard-boiled modern noir, told in the style of an Alex Cross mystery. An outsider by nature, Grace, is forced to penetrate the elaborate inter-workings of her city and its more insidious underbelly when the body of her former fiancé, Michael Dunne is found floating in a remote river. Grace can't seem to shake the hysterical phone call from the top of a bridge that she received from Michael the day before his body was discovered. A call in which the police have claimed to be proof of his apparent suicide. From the highest-ranking political power to the lowest-level burnout, no one is above suspicion of murder. As Grace infiltrates the social and political web more deeply, her theory solidifies and each player's role becomes clear, from the mystery woman who has offered her help, to the shifty police department. Grace may soon be ready to make her case, even if it's too late for her to get out.
Want to see what the film is intended to look like? Here is the Lookbook for the film! 
Is it Going to be Good?
It's totally going to be good! I've spent a year working on the screenplay for this film and we have a lot of pre-production worked out. You may find yourself asking ""Who are you to be doing this?""  I'm honored to have some awards under my belt.

Personal Story
I've been asked about my personal connection to the story, and why I started it in the first place. When I was younger my best friend committed suicide and I refused to believe it. I know I was simply going through the stages of depression, but the denial stage lasted significantly longer than the rest. I suspected a lot of different reasons for her death. I went through a lot of different situations that could have happened to her before accepting the reality that she was sick. When I began conception of this film, I started with the idea of ""What if I was right?"" What if there was this woman who was in the same position I was in? Told the same things I was told. But what if she kept pushing? What if she found a secret reason why this apparent suicide was not a suicide? The story is basically my thoughts while going through my experiences. I want to share this story because I feel it has a great progression of the characters to the point where you end up caring about them as much as I do."

700,2091140886,"I am kicking off this KickStarter in the hopes that I can raise enough funds to start this new podcast. This podcast will focus in on regular people doing pretty cool things. I believe most people would enjoy it because they'd be able to connect with the guest and my hope is that by listening in they'll make an effort to live the life they want, not the life they have now. 
By bringing in a wide selection of guests there will be something for everyone. Whether you're thinking of going back to the gym, school, or starting your own business hearing other people that took the risk and listening first hand to the struggles they overcame will guide you in the right direction.
The episodes themselves will run un-timed, unscripted and uncensored meaning the conversation may lead wherever the guest would like. It won't be a boring interview like setting, guests will be welcome to talk about what they feel is important and what has made them successful as well as giving the audience a few pointers to guide them in the right direction.
Podcasting is expensive, and I will need to allocate the money to buy new equipment (microphones, headphones, mixing board) as well as renting a studio to record the episodes. That's not taking the time and money needed to engineer the episodes so that they are of the best quality. 
As for myself I am a 30 year old Jack of all trades/Master of none. As I updated my resume for a new round of interviewing I realized I had experience in a lot of fields. I've met some really interesting people along the way and thought it would be pretty sweet to record some of these people in 1-on-1  episodes.  I reached out to many other people and there is about 10 episodes lined up as well as many on the fence. Once they hear a few episodes I'm certain they'll see the podcast is a great idea for them personally and professionally.
Anything you pledge really, really helps. Costs add up quickly! If you'd like to pledge but can't right now I completely understand (that's why I'm running a KickStarter.) I still hope you come check the podcast out. We'll be starting soon. So give us a listen.

701,1853824500,"Add flexibility to your Jasper or Duchess gaming table!
Introducing Geode Gaming, a 3D printed gaming accessories company.  We’ve been 3D printing for years, both as a hobby, educationally, and professionally, and now we’re launching, focused on tabletop gaming and the community.
Today we’re launching a line of accessories designed to upgrade the Jasper and the Duchess gaming tables (produced by BoardGameTables.com™)
Product Details
Jasper Cup Holder/Wine Glass Holder compatible mounts
These cup holder mounts were designed to be compatible with the Jasper’s dove-tail style cup holders and wine glass holders.  Use these to:
Add Jasper Cup Holder mounts to your Duchess table or add new mount locations to the long edges of your Jasper table.
We think corner mounting the cup holders on the long side of your table are great for:
Accommodating left and right handed players in all seating positions
Giving more seating options to sit closer to the center of the table with smaller gaming groups
Giving you the ability to have more than 1 cup per player at the table for larger parties
Support squeezing more than 6 players around the table, each with a cup needing a home
  Jasper Side Table compatible mounts
The side table mount was designed to be compatible with the Jasper’s dove-tail style side table.  Use these to:
Add Jasper Side Table mounts to your Duchess table or to add new side table mount locations to the long edge of your Jasper table. 
Add two cup holder locations to the corner of your table
We think corner mounting a side table (or two cup holders) is great for:
Giving your DM/GM/Rules reference designee somewhere to sit manuals at the table without taking precious gaming space
All the benefits of a corner mounted cup holder, plus the flexibility to double up on cup holders, or a side table - the ultimate mounting flexibility for your Jasper accessories
  Jasper Wine Glass Holder Riser
Give your wine glasses a lift.  This riser lets your glass sit comfortably, and allows you to pick up the glass closer to how you’d pick it up were it sitting on your dinner table.
The wine glass riser features a large chamfered ring to be compatible with many different diameter wine glasses, and even some other glasses you might not be comfortable with in the normal cup holder. 
Bonus feature!  The wine glass riser can easily be rotated to give you (some) added safety against your elbow knocking your glass out of the holder.
Don't have Jasper Cup Holders, Wine Glass Holders, or a Side Table?  No problem.  Boardgametables.com™  offers the cup holders for sale without a gaming table, so you can get some to add to your Duchess, or pick up some more for your Jasper table.
Don't have a gaming table? Want to upgrade your gaming setup to a Jasper?  Good news everyone!  BoardGameTables.com currently has a campaign running for the Jasper with some new stain and shipping options.  You can check out that campaign here, and if you missed it, you can late pledge on their website.
Update - New use case added for Side Shelf Mounts and Cup Holder Mounts!
We've added a new use case for the mounts, based on the suggestion of a Backer.  You can now use your mounts for storage of up to 6 cup holders/wine glass holders below your gaming vault!
To store 6 cup holders (three per cross-support under your table), add 1 Side Shelf Mount and 1 Cup Holder Mount to each cross support.
Mix and match up to 2 mounts per side to store 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 cup holders.  Bonus, the Wine Glass Riser can be flipped to the underside of the wine glass holder to be stored with the wine glass holder.
Installation
All pledges that include at least 1 Cup Holder Mount or Side Table Mount will also receive an alignment tool.   
The alignment tool inserts snugly into the underside of the cup holder and side table mounts.  It features a built-in spacer to set the mount at the correct distance from the gaming vault on your Jasper or Duchess table (to prevent interference when installing a cup holder or side table) and also features a handle to hold onto while installing. 
Here’s a link to the installation video we made, showing how you’ll install the mounts onto your Jasper or Duchess table: 
All pledges will also include the necessary mounting hardware, which has been selected and thoroughly tested to be safe for installation in your Jasper or Duchess table without the risk of protruding through your arm rests, or risk of splitting the wood.  NOTE: If you’re installing these somewhere besides your Jasper or Duchess table, you must pre-drill the wood before screwing them in.  Some hardwoods run the risk of splitting, if not pre-drilled.
Manufacturing and Materials
All of the accessories offered in this campaign are planned to be 3D printed in house on our print farm.  All printed parts will be made of engineering grade PET based materials.  What does that mean for you?  It means that unlike other 3D printed parts you may have, which are likely printed out of PLA, these parts have some significant advantages:
PET printed parts do not degrade over time
They do not deform from being left under load - so no reason to take that side table off after you’re done gaming
They also flex, instead of crack - great for those accidental bumps, and repeated load cycling
  We are offering color options for all the printed rewards as well.  You can match your gaming room, your gaming surface, or pick a color that will blend in with the stain color of your gaming table.  Select from the following 10 colors, or mix and match:
Blue
Orange
Teal
Black
White
Grey
Purple
Red
Yellow
Green
  So, PET based 3D printed parts are just awesome, no downsides?  Not exactly… If you do some searching around, you’ll find no shortage of print quality issues to overcome when using PET.  Fortunately, we’ve got you covered.  We’ve spent considerable time fine tuning the models and the print settings to achieve excellent quality straight off the printer.
We’re also exploring some post processing options.  If the volume of parts far exceeds our planning, we will also explore other methods of fabrication (injection molding, etc) to help you get your pledges quickly.
Rewards and Add-ons in Detail
All pledges include the required mounting hardware and alignment tools for the parts you’ve pledged for.  We’ll be sending out a survey at the end of the campaign for you to let us know what items you’ve over-pledged for, and what colors you’d like everything printed in (selectable by part).
We have an “Early Beta Bird” pledge level which gets you all of the following, and ships shortly after the funds have been received after campaign closing:
1 Side Table Mount
2 Cup Holder Mounts
1 Wine Glass Riser
All Required Mounting Hardware
$30 of Add-on credit, to be used in the campaign survey
  Note that with the Beta pledge level, the Add-on credit items will ship in your choice of colors, along with any additional Add-on items you over-pledge for, in the normal fulfillment window.  You’ll receive 2 separate shipments.
There are three normal pledge levels, all with unlimited time, unlimited quantities, and all supporting Add-ons by over-pledging.  The table below summarizes what you receive for each of the three pledge levels. 
The following table lists all the Add-ons and their pricing.  For the Add-ons, the shipping is included in the price listed in the table. 
New Add-on Packs!
These Add-on packs are offered to backers in all shipping regions and extend the discounted pricing of the Maximum Flexibility and the + Storage pledge levels for however many packs you'd like.
Add-ons for international backers cost slightly more, to account for the added costs of customs and taxes.
 As an example, we’ve calculated some of the over-pledge amounts for various pledges with Add-ons.  If you have any questions, please do ask in the comments about the appropriate pledge, and we’ll help out.

 When the campaign ends, we’ll be using Kickstarters built-in survey to find out what Add-on items you’d like, and what colors you want each part printed in.  There will not be a pledge manager, so please do over-pledge before the end of the campaign if you’d like to add any additional items at their Kickstarter pricing.  After the campaign closes, late pledges will be done through our website, at pre-order pricing, which will be higher than the Kickstarter launch pricing in this campaign.
Thank you!"

Founded in June 2017, The Warblr is a New York-based digital media site that incorporates elements of Buzzfeed, The Onion, and HuffPost. We are dedicated to bringing readers quality content across six verticals:

  ORIGINS STORY
In early June 2017, over bottomless brunch in the West Village, Ying and Hillary both agreed that they were tired of crying over the Trump administration. The ultimate antidote to crying? Laughing. And most importantly, having as many people as possible join in. 
Over time and after much brainstorming and trial and error, the direction of The Warblr became two-fold: Laugh, but also contribute in ways that are meaningful. In instances where news is just too serious to incite laughter, long-form opinion essays are where we turn raw emotion into potent narrative, particularly through our op-ed writers who bring depth and personal experience to national events and crises. 
  HOW THE FUNDS WILL BE USED
We are ready to take The Warblr to the next level. The funds will be deployed towards immediate needs to remain competitive, including increasing traffic, improving data analytics, and building out a stronger backend of tech support. 
And as any sharp mind in digital publishing knows: Video is king. Beginning in 2018, we plan to roll out video content across our verticals, establishing The Warblr as a true full-spectrum digital media brand.

703,650058238,"In the Lost City of the Inca, Diane takes a Kodak moment with Mallku, renowned Peruvian Shaman and author, and Hebert Jordan, the Shaman of Machu Picchu, before conducting a full-moon eclipse Energy Attunement Salon.
Welcome to Angelic Reality's Energy Attunement Deck, a completely new invention from an ancient tradition.
I was an Emmy Award-winning art direcor when I died and 7 Chakra Angels brought me back into my body. To this day they continue to inspire and guide my life of painting, recording albums and conducting Energy Attunement Salons internationally - salons that connect people with their inner power, and with each other.  And Kickstarter is providing this fabulous opportunity to bring my work directly to you.
I am happy to introduce two completely new tools I created  to help you bring fresh perception to any situation, make healthy choices in each moment, and share this power with others.  These tools are a fine-art deck of 49  cards illustrated with my original paintings, called the ""Energy Attunement Deck"", and its companion, the ""Mystic Tapestry"" which locates each card in a matrix of Energy Centers that mirror ourselves.
 The Energy Attunement Deck
49 fine art cards reflect the Energy Centers within each of us, and help us connect and communicate deeper things in a fun way.
The Energy Attunement Deck first showed up in my life as a notion. I have been conducting Path of Illumination Salons for one to hundreds of people, from venues throughout the Americas to the crop circles in England, and leading guided spiritual tours to sacred places - from Alaskan glaciers to Machu Picchu, Peru.  
I saw firsthand how these experiences can empower us with the fresh perspective, and even bring us to life-changing realizations.  And  I thought, How can each of us connect with, refresh and empower ourselves -  everyday, on our own?  So I began a long process of inventing the tools to do just that.  
The Energy Attunement Deck and Mystic Tapestry are my reward. You can put them to work in any number of ways. Draw a card for the day, or for a specific question. Draw 7 cards for a full read. Hold your own salon with just you (and the 7 Chakra Angels.) Hold an Energy Attunement Salon with others. Play an ""Express & Guess"" game with friends. Or simply practice each card with yoga-like interpretive motion, to activate your energy and feel the flow.
The cards are simple. Each of the 49 cards has a one-word essence (the title of its painting) that finds its place on a matrix called the ""Mystic Tapestry"".
The Mystic Tapestry
The Mystic Tapestry is also simple. Unlike the conventional vertical column of chakras stacked on the human body, the Tapestry's matrix of 49 positions  articulates a much more complex view of life's energy into a clear and simple organization that makes sense - and gives each of us much more personal content to understand and work with.
Seven vertical columns of activated energy intersect seven horizontal rows of receptive energy centers. Colored ribbons match each card to its place on the Tapestry, and reflect the healing modality of its color, as well as each color's healing sound frequency.
At every point on the Mystic Tapestry where an activated energy intersects an energy center - there is a card with it’s Essence.  
The Mystic Tapestry casts these cards into a nexus of relationships and dynamics that mirror us at any moment, offering the opportunity for contemplation and fresh insight. Draw a card, and let your self-discovery begin. You are your instrument. The Energy Attunement Deck and Mystic Tapestry are your tools. 
Chakras and Angels...
Our knowledge of Energy Centers derive from ancient teaching of chakras (which means ""spinning wheels"" in Sanskrit), a name for concentrations of specific energy related to specific portals in and around each of us. Western science finds their corollary in our ""glandular system"" - regulating mood, metabolism, crisis response, etc. 
Scientist Candice Pert broke the old convention when she identified the way our intelligence resides in our cells. Likewise, my body of work sees each of us as ""a community of Energy Centers"".  Each center, or chakra, has its own specific gift that we can call on to support our other six centers, and our whole wellbeing.
For example, we can call on the Chakra Angel ""Innocence"" to help us activate our Power Energy from our solar plexus to support our Love Center, our Heart Chakra. This is the card ""Choice"" inviting you to contemplate what this alchemical experience means to you in the ""now"" moment. In this way your Energy Attunement Deck becomes a ""self-coaching"" tool.
The 7 Chakra Angels hold their places in the deck and tapestry as the guides for activating the Energy Centers. ""Destiny"" is the Chakra Angel for our gift of Grounding, ""Passion"" for the gift of Relationship, ""Innocence"" for Power, ""Freedom"" for Love, ""Patience"" for Expression, and ""Grace"" for Insight. ""Joy"" supports us with the unconditional loving energy of our Soul.
""Diane's work is beautiful and powerful...it is really needed in this crazy society.  Many people are looking for peace and joy....the kind Diane can give them with her work.""    
 Lydia Kramer
All the things you can do with your deck:
Read Your Cards: 
Choose a card for the day, or reflect on a particular subject or question.
Rhiannan displays her 3-card ""Cause & Effect"" reading
Draw 7 cards for a full card spread reading to develop more perspective - 1.“Here/now"", reflecting you in the ""now"" moment, 2.”Cause”, 3.”Effect”, 4. “Foundation”, and 5.“Illumination”. Then draw two ""Go Deeper"" cards and cross any cards you want to contemplate further. Give yourself a reading, and give a reading to a friend.  
Hold your own Energy Attunement Salon: 
The cards are all about process. I designed them to serve the process  expressed in my Path of Illumination Energy Attunement Salons, “a gathering of people who love the truth”. 
PLAY

Your Energy Attunement Salon can be a few hundred close friends and a rock band celebrating the 7 Chakra Angels, or four cards over dinner for two. The Energy Attunement Deck is a perfect formula for any occasion.  
Laci and Joe experience a read for their newly arriving baby, Jude, and cross ""Integration"" (Soul supporting Grounding in the world) with a ""Go Deeper"" card, ""Legacy"" (invisible footprints of the Soul).
You don't have to worry about these cards wrecking an event. They are ""baby-safe"" - a new and fresh frame through which to view whatever you bring to your cards.  You do the interpreting.  As I always ask, ""What does this mean to you?""
Practice the Deck: 
Much like a Yoga that you interpret yourself. You can’t go wrong. Why shouldn’t connecting with your own energy be a pleasing, relaxing, physical experience… a practice? And you can come out of it aligned and refreshed for what’s to come.
Kristen practices the ""Play"" card in a ""Cause and Effect"" read, bringing Soul Energy (1) into her Power Center(3). before she's off picking up some Grounding Energy (4) for her next card.
Play the Game: 
Engage friends and family in an ""Express & Guess"" game and have fun acting out - and talking about - real subjects. This game is about you.
Draw a card, act it out, pass it to the winning guesser to explain and choose the next actor! Audrey guessed ""Play"" and then got straight to the point.
 Text a Card to a Friend:
Herald their birthday; Offer a moment of support; Make a statement; Share a sentiment; Give a fresh view to a question or issue they’re facing.  As funding exceeds our goal we'll hire web wizards to build our card app that will  make this easy on your iPad or phone.
The Energy Attunement Deck brings insight and fun, anywhere, any time to anyone, in just about any situation.  
It’s a New Year’s Resolution:

I have worked with these friends over many years in just this kind of business. We're seasoned, love the work we do, and are very excited about bringing the Energy Attunement Deck  to everyone.
Our Kickstarter Goal 
We will use our funds to:   1. Publish our cards and related materials;   2. Expand our website as a hub for our growing online community, and as an outlet for our products and services; and  3. Produce videos and webinars that help you understand and use the Energy Attunement Deck.
In the event we exceed our Kickstarter goal, we will expand our business with larger print runs, additional card apps, printed books, outreach and support to our growing online community.
Here is a sample of the interviews our website will include - mind-opening discussions with ""spiritual activists"" who illuminate each card.

704,376546088,"This is a feature film we shot in March and April this year on location in London, Dungeness and Chipping Norton.
The story was written by Andrew Keatley (whose new play, 'The Gathered Leaves', will be on at the Park Theatre from July 15th - August 15th) and developed by our incredibly talented cast - Jacob Casselden, Sophie Roberts, David Acton, Carolyn Pertwee, Rita Davies, Racheal Joseph, Daryl Jackson, Nicholas Bishop, Christopher Doyle and Grace Goulding. The film looks and sounds amazing, thanks to our cinematographers Iris Lebrun & Scott Norris and our sound recordist Guy Fixsen. 
We made the film with our own money and now we just need a little bit extra to pay for post-production and to finish the movie to the highest possible standards. 
This next stage is expensive. We need time in an editing studio and we need to record a score and grade the picture. So we need your help. We can't do this without you!
Any help you can give us will make a huge difference and we can't emphasise enough how much your generosity is appreciated. Now the filming is completed have a sneak peek of some of the raw footage. 
We feel like we have the potential to make a great film that we hope all of you will one day enjoy.
Thank you so much for your help!

705,282435533,"In humanity, there have been so many tragedies based on fear. Where fear exists, hatred grows and humanity, for a time, ceases to exist as it should. Our country and the world around us has been faced with hard choices. We can choose to live in fear of the unknown or we can choose to let our humanity rule in our hearts. The threat of terrorism looms over societies across the world, and yet, it has tragically effected many with no place left to go. People have lost homes, family members, and their way of life. They have become refugees, desperate for safety, stability, a place to go on living until war and fighting stops destroying their homes. Many refugees are small children and some who are alone with no families. So many of these children without parents and siblings to watch over them have been lost to sex trafficking and have disappeared from the safety and protection of communities. We cannot allow fear to drive us from the humanity of helping those in need. My painting series is to expose the vulnerability of refugee children to give a face to the supposed “enemy” that has created so much fear. In creating this series, it is of the utmost importance to me that I do not promote propaganda with the portrayal of random sad faced children. On the contrary, my work will represent hope, dignity, and humanity. This series will initially consist of twelve portraits and will continue as an ongoing project. "
706,1309901766,"Synopsis
Maroon is about a boy who runs away from home because he believes he can find a better life somewhere else... ""How about the woods?"" 
While cold at night and regretting his decision, the boy is knocked out by an unknown force in the middle of the woods. He awakens in an encampment of boys who were all run-aways. The boy is treated badly and forced to fight against an opposing group of kids. 
Why
We have made videos/shorts for a long time now, and thought we were ready to step it up a notch. We are creating Maroon to learn, grow, and have fun.

 Helping Without Donating
You may not want or be able to donate, but you can still help! Tell your friends and family about the movie. We need all the support we can get! 
Friends Living their Dream
Cole and William, and much of the cast members have been friends for a long time. To see a group of kids come together to bring something like this to life is just mind-blowing. Kids really do have a potential that can become a meaningful part of your life.

Discover the Pledge for Honest Candidates that will clean up Congress
Do you have a huge desire that isn’t being addressed because our government is controlled by money? Want to prepare for the effects of climate change? Want to stop the Trans Pacific Partnership because you’re afraid that companies like Monsanto will sue our government, thus making taxpayers into their piggybank? Do you want to protect net neutrality, stop fracking, or get off fossil fuels?
We can stop the cronies and the monopolies from writing their own laws. No more taxation without representation. No more financial institutions extracting money with their Ponzi schemes and opaque market practices. The tools in this book are exactly what the American people need to revolt without violence! Find out the specific actions that local communities have been taking to change the course of our country.

Historiekanon är kortspelet som ger dig historisk överblick, samtidigt som du spelar och har roligt.
Du samlar på några av de viktigaste kändisarna från renässansen till år 1900. Genom händelsekorten ändras spelet snabbt, när krig, revolutioner och uppfinningar stjälper eller hjälper dig och dina medspelare. ”Historiekanon” är ett pedagogiskt spel som hjälper dig att skapa en mental tidslinje, samtidigt som du spelar och har roligt.
Jag som gjort spelet heter Frida Malmgren, och är förutom historienörd verksam som psykolog, författare och serietecknare. I mitt arbete som skolpsykolog har jag märkt är att många saknar en röd tråd att förhålla sig till. Då blir historia bara ett virrvarr av kungar, krig och konstiga gubbar i peruk. Detta vill jag ändra på med spelet! Genom att spela, se samband, och lära dig några nyckelpersoner, får du en baslinje att knyta upp nya fakta på. Därför är det så bra att spelet består av kort. De kan användas som stödbilder, grupperas, eller skapa tidslinjer när du läser läxor tillsammans med barnen. Jag har valt att avbilda karaktärerna så porträttlikt som möjligt, utifrån gamla målningar. Min tanke är att det är viktigt att du känner igen figurerna om du senare stöter på dem i en historiebok. Urvalet är framtagen i samarbete med flera historielärare från mellanstadiet upp till universitetsnivå, vilket gör att det passar utmärkt för att spela för både stora och små.
Det är över ett år sen jag startade det här projektet, och det vore så fantastiskt att få se korten bli verklighet! Spelet är i stort sett färdigt och jag är redo att be tryckeriet dra igång maskinerna så fort jag fått finansiering för projektet. Min stora förhoppning är att de är redo att levereras i god tid för att bli den perfekta julklappen, så att du har spelet redo tilljulklappsutdelningen i år. (Men är det något Postnord och 2020 lärt mig är det tyvärr att allt kan hända).
Jag skulle bli fantastiskt glad om du vill stötta projektet och beställa ett spel eller två till dig, kusinen, dottern, tanten på konsum eller grannen. Stort tack på förhand!

Hur spelar man?
Spelet  består av cirka 100 karaktärskort, sorterade i olika kategorier som ”astronomer”, ”franska monarker” och ""upplysningsfilosofer"". Därtill finns lika många händelsekort: tex. ”Franska revolutionen 1789-93”, dessa kort påverkar ger möjlighet att få extrapoäng, eller spelets gång och kopplar personerna till händelserna. Uppgiften är att samla på “familjer”, dvs olika grupper av karaktärskorten. Familjerna kan bestå av allt mellan mellan 1 till 7 kort. Korten är även grupperade utifrån historiska epoker, som vasaätten, stormaktstiden, frihetstiden och 1800-talet som avgör när i spelet de presenteras.
Varje karaktärskort visar en person, namn och mellan vilka år personen levde. Kortet visar också vilken familj personen tillhör. Som exempel visar kortet “Gustav Vasa” att han tillhör familjen ”Vasa”, på kortet presenteras listan med de andra sju medlemmarna.
Spelet börjar med att given delar ut fem karaktärskort till varje spelare för att sedan lägga resterande kort med bildsidan nedåt mitt på bordet. Händelsekorten skall också placeras på bordet, men delas inte ut. Utse vem som börjar och sätt igång!
Spelrunda:
Dra ett händelsekort. Läs högt och följ instruktionen på händelsekortet. Fortsätt därefter med nästa punkt om inte händelsekortet säger något annat.
Välj en person att fråga efter ett kort du samlar på. Till exempel: “Lisa, har du upptäcksresande”. Om spelaren har ett kort som tillhör kategorin så måste hen lämna över dem till dig och då får du fortsätta fråga tills du får ett nej eller “finns i sjön”. Det går även att svara “finns i annalen” då korthögen med god humoristisk vilja passerar som en form av årsbok. Turen går därefter över medurs.
Du avslutar rundan med plocka upp ett karaktärskort från högen. 
Spelet är slut när alla karaktärskort är slut och samlade i familjer hos spelarna. Vinnaren är den som får flest poäng, både från antalet familjer och från händelsekorten.
ENGLISH (google translate):
NB! Since the game is in Swedish, and the and many of the characters are Swedes, please think twice before ordering if you do not speak Swedish, Danish or Norweigan. Historiekanon is a card game filled with historical characters and events from the Renaissance until the year 1900. You collect groups of cards, like ""mathematicians"" ""French regents"" etc. The winner is whoever collect most families. The games target groups is kids and adult who wish to play a fun and educative game together.  History Canon is the card game that gives you a historical overview, while you play and have fun.
You collect some of the most important celebrities from the Renaissance to the year 1900. Through the event cards, the game changes quickly, when wars, revolutionaries and inventions overthrow or use you and your teammates.
""History Cannon"" is an educational game and the purpose is, in addition to entertaining, to help the player create a mental timeline.Something I have noticed in my work as a school psychologist is
that many people lack a common thread to relate to. Then history becomes just a jumble of kings, wars and strange old men in wigs. I want to change this with the game! By playing, seeing connections, and learning some key people, you get a baseline to tie new facts on. That is why it is so good that it is with only cards. The cards can be used to group, act as supporting pictures, or create timelines when reading homework with the children. The content of the card game is the future in collaboration with several history teachers from middle school up to university level, which makes it excellent for playing for both young and old.
My name is Frida Malmgren, and in addition to being a history nerd am a psychologist, author and cartoonist. I have chosen to portray the characters as portrait-like as possible, based on old paintings. As a cartoonist, it was tempting to make simpler caricatures, but my thought is that it is important that you can come back to the filigues if you later come across them in a history book. It's been over a year since I started this project, and it would be so amazing to see the cards come true! During the year I have read, made lists, sketched, tore my hair and drew, drew, drew. The game is now almost finished and I am ready to be the printer to start the machines as soon as I have received funding for the project. My great hope is that they are ready to be delivered in good time to become the perfect Christmas present, so that you have it in your hand for the Christmas present this year.
I would be fantastic if you would support this project and order a game or two for you, the cousin, the daughter, the auntor or the neighbor! Thanks in advance!"
709,362016602,"The ultimate campaign setting for your tabletop roleplaying game, story, or movie within the world of JourneyQuest and The Gamers!
After two years of writing, editing, art, layout, and review, The Fartherall Companion is complete... and the books begin printing as soon as this Kickstarter campaign ends!
This deluxe guide to the Nine Ages of Fartherall is a collectible that will take a place of pride on any shelf: 
460 pages, including over 100 in full color, on 100# silk paper
The complete history of the world of The Gamers and JourneyQuest 
8.5x8.5 inch format (fits perfectly next to the Strowlers World Bible!)
Foil-embossed leatherette cover
Written by Matt Vancil, the creator of The Gamers and JourneyQuest, this book represents over twenty years of worldbuilding from a master of fantasy.
Don't want the deluxe edition? You may also pledge for a standard softcover edition, with a cover painted by Wayne Reynolds and a black and white interior.
The Softcover Edition
What is Fartherall? 
This is not the only world there is.
Even in the world’s earliest ages, its inhabitants, both mortal and divine, were aware of the existence of other worlds. From the emergence of the gods from the primordial chaos to the arrival of the two migrant elder races, Fartherall’s history has involved visitors from elsewhere.
In the middle ages of Fartherall, waves of peoples arrived en masse or awakened in the abandoned places of the world. Its pantheon expanded and contracted as deific entities arrived, departed, transformed, or were slain. And in the margins of the world, in the wildest corners and sealed away in tomb-like ruins, lay Creation’s most dangerous pitfalls—black circles—those indestructible holes in the universe that lead to destinations unknown even to the gods.
A fantasy world created by Matt Vancil, Fartherall is the setting of dozens of stories told over the last twenty years: from The Gamers to JourneyQuest and from The Gamers: Nodwick's Tale (by Aaron Williams) and The Shadow's Dungeon (by Sean Reynolds) to Nethadrick's Pranks (by Kevin Mickelson). 
Plus, the book features hundreds of new characters, from heroes to villains to demigods, created by the Fartherall fan community!
While many of these stories and characters originated in comedy, Fartherall the world isn't a farce. Matt Vancil has meticulously built a fantasy world around consistent physics, themes, and rules, a world where unlimited new stories are possible, from the early ages of gods and mythic heroes to the grimy protagonists of the Age of Steam, from intimate fairy tales to dimension-hopping epics.
Although only gnomes are allowed to break the laws of physics when they fall. It's in the rules. Sorry.
Who is This Book Made For? 
Everyone has a place in Fartherall
Fantasy Fans — If you love worldbuilding, this book is for you. This epic history is a compelling story all on its own, with a shocking reveal in the Eighth Age that ties together tens of thousands of years of in-depth fantasy storytelling.
Tabletop Gamers — This book is intentionally rules-agnostic, but contains enough detail to adapt cleanly to your game of choice. From the schools of magic to dozens of fantasy races, you and your party can find infinite ideas and adventure hooks within these pages.
Writers, Artists, and Filmmakers — The SCULA (see below) gives you broad permission to create and sell your own stories, films, and art from within the world of Fartherall. Use this book to help your own creations qualify for Canon status within Fartheral as an official part of the story.
JourneyQuest and Gamers Fans — This book is the definitive guide to the entire history of the world. While some details are kept secret (we don't want to spoil the end of either series) there's enough information and backstory here to provide endless context for the events of existing films, novels, and games, from the disappearance of the elves to exactly what happened in Pwned at the end of the 6th Age.

Why Kickstarter?
It's simple: the interior of this book is gorgeous and we want deluxe editions for our own shelves. We also checked in with the backers of the original Fartherall Companion campaign and many said the same thing. And then we checked in with the wider JourneyQuest fandom and they said ""Gimme!""
That's why we're doing an ultra-short campaign to reach the threshold where we can print this deluxe edition affordably. If we reach our goal, the deluxe edition happens. If we don't reach our goal, we'll print the standard black and white books as planned.
What's the Timeline?
The moment this campaign closes, we submit a print order to the manufacturer. Printing will take about two weeks, then the books will ship directly to our fulfillment partners at ShipMonk. They will begin worldwide fulfillment shortly thereafter!
Barring the effects of major natural disasters, political unrest, or economic crises on our manufacturing and fulfillment partners, this book is scheduled to be delivered to backers by mid-December of 2020.
What's in the Book?
The short answer? Everything. Except for spoilers. (We don't want to ruin the end of JourneyQuest and The Gamers for you!)
You can download a free PDF preview of The Fartherall Companion right here.
What Rewards are Available?
 $1 – Tip Jar
 $20 – PDF
 $50 – Softcover Standard Edition (black and white, standard 60# paper)
 $100 – Hardcover Deluxe Edition (color, 100# silk paper, stamped foil cover)
What Add-ons are Available?

The dictionaries are the core mechanic of the game. Each player gets a unique dictionary that teaches them how to say the words of the game in their unique language.

I have always had a fascination with the Paleoindian period and wanted to find a way to create something that would interest others about it. There is a lot to be discovered about the first native people, and I hope my books gives a voice to a historical subject that has not had enough attention.
My book is just a fictional tale, but I hope it will open the door to young adult interest in the fascinating world of archaeological discoveries.

I am a writer and science teacher living in Arkansas. I have a master's degree in education and a bachelor's degree in creative writing. I am looking to self-publish and have my book on the shelves by December 2015."
713,274423090,"Hey, my name is Beth Gregory and I'm the sole artist and creator behind Cotton and Clay Design. First of all, I want to thank you for coming here to check out my Kickstarter to raise funds for my kiln. 
I have recently moved into a new house which has the space for me to set-up a studio in the garage, which is a dream come true for me. I used to create and fire my work at Cardiff Pottery Workshops, but I have now moved too far away for this to be an option. I have some money saved to put towards getting the space fire-proofed and to purchase a kiln, however, I still need to raise between £500 and £1000 to go towards the purchase of the kiln.  If I manage to raise £500 this will go towards getting me a small top loader and if I can raise over £1000 this will go towards getting me a slightly larger top loader.
This is where you can help, I am offering a wide range of rewards for donations, so you can help me to purchase a kiln, as well as getting your hands on a piece of my work.  Clay is my passion, my life, my love. It is my dream to be able to create my work full-time and it is becoming more and more possible. The support that I have had in my first year of Cotton and Clay Design has been beyond my wildest dreams.
Example of mini succulent planter with Forest Eye design
Examples of small 6-8oz mugs with larger 18oz mug with Forest Eye design.

  So, how did I get here? 

     Clay has always been a part of my life, my Granny used to be a potter, creating her work from a little shed at the bottom of her garden. I would spend my childhood playing in there and making little fairy houses for the fairies (gnats ha ha) by the stream. I was surrounded by so much creativity growing up, my Mum is also always so inspiring to me, she has always dabbled in different techniques and materials, creating pieces with such fine details. My Dad was also very talented and I have fond memories of drawing with him when I was little. Creativity is in my blood.   
Example of Mushroom Fields design on a large 22oz mug

     I went to Cardiff Met Uni where I graduated with a BA (hons) in Ceramics in 2016. When I set-up Cotton and Clay Design in 2018, it was a way for me to heal after a traumatic experience. I started creating for  love, making things that I wanted to make and things that I wanted for myself. Realising that my work resonated with so many people, I started to create larger bodies of work, expanding my range and creating pieces that I only dreamed of.   
Collaboration with Morgin Riley -Her custom 4oz espresso mug with Forest Eye design.
1 year later, I am making connections with people, collaborating with some of my favourite artists and sending my work around the world, further than I have ever been. This is why I feel that now is the time to make the jump and set-up a studio at home so that I can have more control over firings and more space to work in.   
My Work 
Example of Full Moon Design on a Vase

   My work is an expression of myself and my love for clay, every piece I create is unique and one of a kind. Every piece starts as a ball of clay, I then use a pinch pot technique to form the base of the shape and then, for larger pieces, I add coils to build it up. I use cobalt oxide to either hand-paint my designs on or I use it as an oxide wash to pick out texture on other pieces. Each piece is high fired to 1280 degrees c. and sanded with extra fine sandpaper to create a very smooth and tactile surface. My mugs are glazed with a clear glaze on the inside and left raw on the outside, exposing the pure beauty of the porcelain.   
     I am inspired by a number of things in this world but, nature, astrology and symbolism are my true passions. I adorn each piece with these meaningful and powerful symbols, reflecting my pure love and fascination for them.   
Examples of designs on mini dishes
Example of large full moon wall-hanging

How long will it take to receive your piece? 

   I will need get the fire board fitted and purchase a kiln, which I am hoping won't take longer than a month. I can purchase some porcelain before the end of the campaign so that I can make a start on creating your rewards. Please be aware that I will also be creating these alongside creating my main work so it could take up to 5-6 months before you receive your piece, depending on how many pledges I get. This is because I am only able to make and fire a certain amount of pieces a month. However I will be making a list and working through them as quickly as possible, pledges will be my main priority and I am aiming to tick off 20 pieces a month. These will be done in the order that the pledges come in. All pledges will also have the option of first dibs on updates as well.
Example of Large 24oz Hand-sculpted bracket fungus mug
I want to thank you all for your love and support in helping me make my dreams come true. It means more to me than I can express. I can't wait to start creating all of your special pieces.

715,684862556,"O is a short film written, directed and edited by Darius Hosseini in collaboration with Luke Lewis Productions and starring Emily Bickerdike and Adam Fox.
Photography by Matt Snellin
The shoot is wrapped and the edit complete, but we're going to need your help if it's ever going to see the light of day.
We're hoping to reach a minimum target of £400, which will help to fund the following:
Submission to a variety of film festivals
Blu-Ray/DVD discs and packaging
Disc burner and printer for distribution
Vimeo Plus subscription
Promotional material
Ideally we would like to surpass our minimum target by at least 50% in order for us to be able to submit to more film festivals for much wider circulation.
Synopsis
O is a ten minute black and white film about a young and naïve married couple experiencing trouble in their relationship. Despite mistreating each other, they have become so dependent on each other that they have become trapped with no means of escape.
Rewards
We've come up with a selection of exciting rewards for backers. Any contribution starting from £2 grants you access to an exclusive premiere screening at The Angel Coffee House in Lincoln. The date for the screening will be Sunday 22nd July, with doors opening at 6:30pm.

Photographic mosaics in high resolution using 100 colours, all made from natural materials. Unique and Individual.
For the production of two samples, with a combined size of 30 m2 and the launch and creation of a website I require 23.415 EUR.
Our technology allows me to transfer any sort of digital image onto a suitable set of building modules.
Imagine the wall of a large concrete building that looks like the countryside in the background, or a large hall whose walls shine with wonderful baroque colours, reproducing the work of a renowned artist. Imagine transforming the bottom of your swimming pool into a picture of your choice. Imagine your living room coming to life with a group image of your family, spanning three or four generations. Imagine any interesting image, from nature to still life, a scene from a beloved film, anything whatsoever – all in the form of a beautiful mosaic based on a photograph or photomontage, in 100 colours, constructed with tiles made from natural materials varying in size from 0.5 cm2 (for indoor purposes) to 0.5 m2 (for outside purposes). 
The uses of our mosaics are only limited by a client’s imagination.
The mosaics are intended for use in architecture, interior design, portraits, family compositions, artwork reproductions, transfer of photographs on walls and ceilings: with the resolution of 4 dots per cm2. 
Thermally insulated module 230 mm x 155 mm
Description:

Une première quête 
 Début 2016, je publiais mon premier livre ULTRA-ORDINAIRE - JOURNAL D’UN COUREUR (Éditions de l’Homme).
Vendu à près de 8 600 exemplaires dans toute la francophonie, j'y décris en mots et en photos ma progression en tant que coureur, du débutant peinant à franchir un maigre deux kilomètres à l’ultra-marathonien confirmé enchaînant six courses de 120 km ou plus en une seule saison.
Et les lecteurs adorent : Amazon.ca 5/5 (17 avis), Amazon.fr 4,5/5 (37), GoodReads 4,1/5 (33), Babelio 4,1/5 (11), FNAC 5/5 (7)
Puis une pause de tout
Après plusieurs mois de promotion et de conférences, j’ai écrit ceci après une course de 100 km en Australie :
« Je termine cette course, mais après, c’est fini. Plus jamais ça. (...) Je n’ai plus la force d’avoir froid. Ni chaud. Ni faim. Ni soif. Ni mal. Ni d’être fatigué. Ni de courir en pleine nuit à 3000 m d’altitude. »
Oh, il y a aussi eu quelques soucis financiers (merci à mon comptable de l’époque) et le début de la fin de mon couple. Bref. Du jour au lendemain, j’ai arrêté de courir. Pendant dix mois, rien. Comme tout le monde, j’ai pris le métro pour aller travailler.
Mais c’est difficile de ne pas courir.
Autoportraits de l'auteur en coureur de fond
Un retour à la course
C’est difficile de ne pas courir alors que je me retrouve coincé dans le métro et que je connais par cœur le sentier qui me sépare du bureau.
Alors, presque par dépit, je prends de nouveau mes jambes à mon cou et le résultat est à la hauteur de mes attentes : pénible, lent et douloureux.
Parfait, je n’ai pas idéalisé ce sport.
Il me faudra plusieurs mois pour retrouver le conditionnement nécessaire pour effectuer de nouveau mes allers-retours. Mais, encore une fois, ce sont les photos qui vont dicter ma motivation quotidienne.
Puis à la photographie
 Pour ce retour à la photo, j’ai décidé cette fois de tourner l’objectif vers moi, de prendre le coureur en action dans son environnement.
Le défi technique venait de monter d’un cran car il me fallait alors réaliser des autoportraits en pleine nature avec du matériel assez léger et robuste pour survivre aux mêmes conditions que moi.
Cliché après cliché, j’ai appris à placer ma caméra aux endroits les plus inusités, comment contrôler l’appareil à distance, à profiter de conditions éphémères en déployant mon attirail en quelques secondes ou planifier certaines scènes pendant des jours et des jours, optant parfois pour le montage pour créer des scènes surréalistes.
Une nouvelle Odyssée
Redécouvrir le fleuve Saint-Laurent 
Depuis la publication de JOURNAL D’UN COUREUR, l’idée de publier une suite me travaille sans cesse. Il me manquait cependant un point focal, une clé qui fournirait la cohésion nécessaire à un nouveau récit. J'avais prévu d'aller courir plus de 1 000 km aux États-Unis quand la COVID-19 a frappé.
J'ai alors profité du confinement pour courir pendant des heures autour de chez moi.
Irrémédiablement, je me dirigeais vers le fleuve Saint-Laurent, majestueux et toujours spectaculaire.
De Percé au sommet du mont Royal
Désireux de trouver un défi sportif estival à ma hauteur, j'ai cherché un parcours qui me permette de profiter de la lumière et des paysages offerts par le fleuve.
Soudain, tout s'est mis en place.
En partant de Percé, puis en longeant le littoral en gardant le Saint-Laurent sur ma droite jusqu'à Montréal, j'allais pouvoir visiter ce que le Québec a de plus beau à offrir, puis partager mon expérience en mots et en photos.
 Une aventure digne d'un deuxième livre 
À paraître en mars 2021 aux Éditions de l'Homme, la plus grande maison d'édition au Québec, mon deuxième livre sera la suite directe de mon premier best-seller : 256 pages couleur, récits de courses et anecdotes, de très nombreuses photos et une mise en page dynamique, respectant ce qui avait fait le succès du premier volume.
En parallèle, mes aventures seront aussi documentées grâce à une expo photo itinérante.
 Prenez part à l'aventure !  
En échange de vos contributions, qui me permettront à court terme de terminer mon livre (écriture et photographies), je vous offre des exemplaires dédicacés de mon futur livre et, pour ceux qui ne l'ont pas encore, des exemplaires dédicacés du premier volume. Et pour la postérité, votre nom sera présent dans la page des remerciements.

722,1093442734,"Synopsis
Swann follows the story of a brash small town girl on an adolescent journey to find meaning in life. At sunrise, at the beautiful Rio Grande Gorge Bridge in the New Mexico desert, she crosses paths with Elizabeth Wolff, a newly retired woman determined to start her own adventurous life after a lifetime working as a number cruncher for the government. This mismatched pair drive off on a 24-hour life-changing odyssey into the desert. When Elizabeth’s car runs out of gas, they stumble across Martin Falls, a gun-toting priest undergoing a crisis of faith and his teenage son Simon, who’s in the process of growing up and away from the only home he has ever known - the desert. Simon and Swann, drawn to one another and to the thrill of an adventure, drive off into the night to visit the ancient cliffs and caves that dot the desert sky. Against a starry backdrop of breathtaking beauty, Swann is finally speechless, dropping the sarcasm that has been her armor, accepting that she has finally found something in life which really means something to her. As this beautiful night comes to an end, Swann is suddenly faced with unexplainable violence, and the possibility of losing everything that she has come to love.
Director’s statement
Swann is a little story with a big heart. A story about evolving, letting go and making a change. Based on a play developed at The Cleveland Play House by acclaimed playwright Sandra Perlman, Swann is a character-driven, quick-witted love story that demonstrates the power of love, connection and community in the face of life’s inevitable questions.
There’s a lot of wit and humor coming from this story, mainly from Swann’s sarcastic way of looking at life and her outrageously know-it-all way of expressing herself - at times reminding us of Juno from the movie with the same title. Swann takes her completely honest views of life and makes us smile or even laugh at her rants while she fearlessly challenges everything that gets in the way on her quest to find the answers she needs. This is what keeps the story’s edgy. 
Shooting location
Swann is set in the beautiful New Mexico desert - at and around the Rio Grande Gorge Bridge.

Get involved!
In a time when the world is gliding apart let’s make a film about people coming together.
Now we need your support to make this film see the light of day! 
We have almost everything in place to move forward and flirt with the big fishes needed to push the production of the final feature film. We have the script, the budget, the business plan, a key crew in mind and we know the locations. Now we need to find our cast and make a trailer that can prove the full potential of the script, and we need your help to do this.
As in all of our film projects we are setting the bar high and we will only settle on making the best this script can be. The money raised on Kickstarter will go straight towards casting, renting equipment, location fees, insurances, pay actors and crew, production design, wardrobe, travels and lodging, post production and the zillion other costs that comes with the complexity of shooting a high end film project. If we manage to reach our goal your support will make it possible for us to start the casting process and shoot the trailer for the feature film. If we manage to exceed our goal, please know that any funds raised above our goal will go straight towards shooting the final full length feature.
Thanks you for your kind support and believing in this project!"

726,592415624,"Help make new Wild @ Heart shirts get made!
What is Wild @ Heart?
Back in 2011 I launched the first designs of my Wild @ Heart shirts in Grey Canine (Wolf or Dog) and White Feline (Tiger), and later, Brown Horse, Blue Dragon and Orange Fox. Each design features a pawprint heart logo on the front and a matching critter tail on the back. 
Here's me wearing one of the original Grey Canine!
I like the idea of having fun 'costumes' that are as simple to wear as putting on a comfy t-shirt, one that you can change depending on today's mood. Design are printed on Gildan Softstyle shirts and are available in sizes S-2XL, with Gildan Ultra Cotton shirts for sizes 3XL-5XL.
As production of screen-printed shirts is an expensive proposition, I have been running them in small batches of 25 shirts, but would frequently run out of sizes, and it is difficult to produce them for online sale.
My target for this Kickstarter is to be able to order a large enough batch from my screen printer that I can cover Anthrocon sales as well as give folks who do not attend conventions the opportunity to purchase shirts. I also introduced new colors for the original designs and would like to be able to reprint those as well. If there is enough support, I would like to launch brand new designs as well!
Grey Canine (wolf or dog)
The first two designs to be reprinted will be the Grey Canine and Orange Fox. Target first available date will be around Anthrocon (early July 2015) but shirts may ship after the convention depending on how close to the convention they arrive from the printer.
Orange Fox
Rewards
My goal is to keep backer fulfillment as simple as possible, so the main rewards are solely for the shirts themselves. 
$25 - Single Shirt Choose from active designs (currently Orange Fox, Grey Canine, and Blue Dragon). You can also contact me to find out which sizes/designs are available in backstock, but my existing inventory is very low at the moment. If stretch goals get close to being funded, they will be added to the rewards list and you can easily switch your pledge to one of them.
Shipping with insurance and tracking is $6 in the USA or $30 international
""Budget"" shipping option available ($4 USA/$15 international). Please note that there is NO insurance or tracking available on the Budget options.
$275 - Custom Color Shirt
Want a green and yellow tiger? A blue and white fox? I have often gotten asked about getting custom colors on a shirt, and my shirt printer can accommodate one-off orders...but ONLY printed along with a normal run of shirts. You specify species, colors, shirt color, and shirt size. No alterations to art, please. Number and placement of colors must be the same or fewer than the original design due to screen printing processes (Most shirts only have 2-3 colors). Shipping with insurance and tracking is $6 in the USA or $30 international (no budget shipping on this one due to cost of production).
For any tier (including the custom color) if you would like to order more than one shirt, just add $25 to your pledge total for each additional shirt. The survey that will be issued at the end of the campaign will ask you for your choices of designs and sizes.
Stretch goals (updated 4/9)
Initial goal: Grey Canine and Orange Fox (in-progress)
$1000: FUNDED! Blue Dragon is the winner of the backer vote and is now unlocked!

730,1656786487," I want to discover what London and Paris look like through a child's eyes. I wonder what things will stand out to a child that an adult might not notice. 
I want to take my daughters, Eliza (age 5) and Olivia (age 18 months) to London and document their experience. Think of it as travel writing from the perspective of a child. I will keep a daily blog where I will write about the experience and upload pictures taken by my daughter. If I get really crazy, I might let the 18 month old take some photos as well. I will also have my daughter write about her experience and upload pictures of her journaling and pictures she draws.  After we return, I plan to use the blog to create a book.
I have noticed that there aren't a lot of books that focus on a child's view of life. Some famous authors will reflect upon their childhoods and try to recreate it. But I think that there is something valuable in capturing what a child sees.
I want to allow my supporters to be a part of this experience. For various donations, you will receive a postcard from Europe, a print of one of Eliza's pictures, or for a substantial donation Eliza will write you a small book about her experience with illustrations. 
My plan is to spend between 2 weeks and 1 month in London while taking side trips to Paris, Amsterdam, and other places. Our home base will be in London though. I think $25,000 is a conservative amount given the cost of plane tickets, lodging, food, etc. I will do my best to be a savvy spender and save money wherever possible."

Aurelie Dupont, longtime star of the Paris Opera Ballet was recently named as its Director! She will perform ""Lament"" from Acts of Light and Appalachian Spring in the Graham Company’s Gala Performance on April 18. Read on to see how you can be a part of this historic night. 
The Martha Graham Dance Company celebrates its 90th anniversary with The Next 90!, marking nearly a century of innovation in modern dance and American art. 
In 1926 Martha Graham created a company that would go on to shape modern dance for generations to come. Often collaborating with other artistic leaders of her time, Martha Graham created some of the first masterpieces of the art form and developed a technique that embraces the natural expressiveness of the  body.
Today the Company continues Graham’s legacy, showcasing her masterpieces alongside brand new dances by today’s top choreographers. The Next 90! – yes, the Company’s 90th anniversary season – is filled with exciting, creative and ambitious events. 
On the occasion of this special milestone, the Company is bringing back Graham classics that haven’t been seen in years, commissioning brand new works from top choreographers Marie Chouinard, Mats Ek, and Pontus Lidberg, and restoring stage sets designed by sculptor Isamu Noguchi. In addition the New York Season (April 14-18) will include live music every night by The Mannes Orchestra, introducing a new educational partnership with The New School’s Mannes School of Music in NYC.
We want you to be part of it, and we need your help. We are raising $90K to celebrate 90 years. We have $30K from our Board, $30K from foundation support – and the last $30K comes from hundreds of Kickstarter supporters. We hope you will be one of them!

In this celebratory 90th year, we plan to go bigger than ever and bring Graham fans – old and new – behind the scenes, into our archives, and even on tour!
As a Kickstarter backer you will have rare access to intimate studio events, artistic tutorials, and the chance to make your own Graham dance to share with the world!
We hope you will join us in celebrating our nine-decade run and help us shape The Next 90!

Janet Eilber: (Artistic Director) has been the Center’s artistic director since 2005. Her direction has focused on creating new forms of audience access to the Graham masterworks. These initiatives include designing contextual programming, educational and community partnerships, use of new media, commissions and creative events such as the Lamentation Variations and Prelude and Revolt. She has also remixed Graham choreography and created new staging in the Graham style for theater/dance productions of The Bacchae and Prometheus Bound. Earlier in her career, as a principal dancer with the Martha Graham Dance Company, Ms. Eilber worked closely with Martha Graham. She danced many of Graham’s greatest roles, had roles created for her by Graham, and was directed by Graham in most of the major roles of the repertoire. She soloed at the White House, was partnered by Rudolf Nureyev, starred in three segments of Dance in America, and has since taught, lectured, and directed Graham ballets internationally. Apart from her work with Graham, Eilber has performed in films, on television and on Broadway directed by such greats as Agnes deMille and Bob Fosse and has received four Lester Horton Awards for her reconstruction and performance of seminal American modern dance. She has served as Director of Arts Education for the Dana Foundation, guiding the Foundation’s support for Teaching Artist training and contributing regularly to its arts education publications. Eilber is a Trustee Emeritus of the Interlochen Center for the Arts. She is married to screenwriter/director John Warren, with whom she has two daughters, Madeline and Eva.

Mr. Ek is the son of celebrated actor Ander Ek, and choreographer Birgit Cullberg, founder of the ballet company that bore her name. Following an early career as an actor, Mr. Ek began his own dance training as a teenager, joining the Cullberg Ballet in 1972 and eventually became its sole artistic director in 1985. Additionally, he has worked extensively as a dancer and choreographer with Nederlans Dans Theater.

733,1966364175,"We are raising money for a billboard campaign to make people aware of jury nullification. Unfortunately, when the day comes that you receive that letter for the dreaded jury duty, most people do whatever they can to get out of it. As a country we need to take a stand and do whatever we can to make people aware of the impact they can make as a member of the jury.
We need to help people understand that being part of a jury is a service that we provide to make sure that the law is not only upheld, but that it is also just. We need to take a stand as a country and make sure jurors know that they must make their final vote mean something, there are too many people who vote with the group. 
Why is this our job? In most states, including Ohio, a defense attorney can not tell the jurors about their power to nullify a law. It is time to stand up and educate the people about the impact they can make as an active member of a jury.
With the billboards we will be able to open the eyes of individuals all over the nation with your help! The billboards will run for a minimum of 3 months and will be located near courthouses or some place where potential jurors will be walking/driving by. The campaign will start in Cincinnati and with enough money we could make this a national campaign. 
Please keep in mind we are not graphic artists so what you see pictured is not the final product. A professional will complete the final product."

Many thanks to all of you who have bought paintings, prints, and studio visits.
 You have helped me reach my initial goal and much more. I started painting today, sharing the kitchen table with homework and coloring on a sunny Sunday morning:
First Layer
Next Color
Part of my reason for doing this project was the desire to paint the 50 small egg tempera pieces. But it is also as a way of getting my work out in front of more eyes. Please keep passing along the link, posting it on Facebook and tweeting it so I can get some more exposure and interest in my work.
This Kickstarter isn't only a way for people to support me. It is a way to buy art at a great price. Every contribution from $75 and up receives an original piece of artwork. Some of the pledge levels buy a painting from the exhibit and some buy a painting that I have already completed -- they are shown on my website and can be chosen in a first-pledge-first-served order. You can see the existing paintings here: http://www.carolineadamsart.com/rewards.html
I have 10 days left and I am setting a new goal of $10,000 as a way of pushing myself to get the word out even further. If you know of anyone who might be interested in my work, please pass along the link to this Kickstarter campaign.
Many thanks again for your support and help. It's been a great success and I'm grateful to all who have supported me thus far.
Now back to the eggs and brushes!
Painting with Eggs
For thousands of years, painters have mixed powdered pigment made from earth and plants with egg yolk and water to create translucent paint (watch the video to see how!). Egyptian sarcophagi, Botticelli masterpieces, and Andrew Wyeth’s haunting landscapes all derive part of their power from egg tempera.
Egg tempera is different. It is translucent and delicate.  Its surface is smooth, but holds great depth. The paint is applied stroke by stroke -- sometimes with a single hair -- taking care not to overlap until the previous layer has dried.  Very slowly, layers of paint build to create a surface that appears to glow from within.
Botticelli's 'Birth of Venus,' an egg tempera masterpiece
With your help, I will make 50 egg tempera paintings.
I have used egg tempera in the past.  I love the slow brush work. I love the way the paint dries almost instantly.  I love the process, building layer after layer of translucent color to create the subtle, ephemeral changes so well suited to landscapes filled with light, clouds, and atmosphere.
Egg tempera and oil on panel by Caroline Adams - 5x7""
Egg tempera and oil on panel by Caroline Adams - 5x7""
Egg tempera and oil on panel by Caroline Adams - 5x7""
I will work on the paintings in batches, 10-15 at a time depending on size and spend around two months on each batch.
I will create a variety of sizes:
7x5"" - 15 paintings
10x8"" - 20 paintings
9x12"" - 5 paintings
14x11"" - 5 paintings
20x16"" - 5 paintings
My brother, Tristram MacDonnell, will build handmade maple frames with splined corners.
When the paintings are finished and framed -- in summer 2014 -- I will rent gallery space from Susan Calloway Fine Arts in Georgetown, Washington, DC, and hang all 50 pieces.  I often think of my smaller work as being part of a larger whole.   I envision the whole room full of small, intimate glimpses of one larger, shared landscape.
With your generous support the following will be possible:
Materials - Ampersand Clay Board panels, new brushes, powdered pigments, eggs
Time - I am an artist but also a mother of two and I work at a gallery part time.  Paying for two extra days of aftercare at my kids' school will give me the time I need to paint.
Presentation - Beautifully handmade frames are an essential finishing element to the paintings
Space - I need to rent the gallery space to exhibit the work
Marketing - Postcards to advertise show, catalogue of show, preview party/opening
Rewards 
There are many rewards to choose from.  Below are some examples of some of the items listed.  The egg tempera paintings from the exhibit are also available as rewards.  They will have a similar feel to some of the paintings shown above.  I will post the paintings as I finish them throughout the year.

This project will explore using color and film style to demonstrate emotions in the film.  We are raising funds in order to professionally produce the film.  We have several industry experts volunteering to work on this film including cinematographers, editors, photographers, actors and more.  We are self-investing as much as possible.
The project started as a way to explore how we all bring pre-existing ideas of love into our lives and how those ideas affect our relationships.  It also explores outside stress on relationships from family and friends.
This film has a full staff and cast and starts shooting in April.

I am passionate about original works of art, decor and home furnishings.   5 years ago I became disabled; I now have healed enough to focus on creating a healthy living from my art and from 25+ years working in the interior design industry.  I am turning the glorious showroom space of my Live/Work Loft into a unique Art & Design Boutique Gallery.  My home (18 yrs) is amazing because my windows are 30' on a corner on an intersection that disperses traffic from several freeway exits. Yay! 
My number one goal is to bring affordable art & design to the masses.  I will be supporting not just just fine artists but I will be supporting makers of home goods and decor,  It does not hurt that my first passion is for interiors.   Just about about everything decorative for the home can be an original work of art.  My creative gallery and boutique will carry decor such as stain glass light switch covers, handmade clocks, mosaic mirrors etc.  In addition to handmade home decor & accessories, My shop will carry and offer custom hand painted and up cycled furnishings.   My gallery shop will literally be supporting 100's of talented people.

This past January I auditioned for a few dance schools hoping to get accepted into at least one of their summer intensives, but I ended up getting into 3/4 of the schools I auditioned for. I ended up choosing Orlando Ballet. As some of you may know attending one of these intensives is not cheap, and can really leave a dent in anyone's wallet. This 5 week long intensive will require me to stay in one of the dorms they provide, but that adds onto the total costs. Making the total $5,000. Luckily I have an extremely supportive family who is willing to let me attended. If I can find ways to get the extra money we need.

The Do-It-Yourself Tonic Kit
Bond ordered a double gin and tonic and one whole green lime. When the drink came he cut the lime in half, dropped the two squeezed halves into the long glass, almost filled the glass with ice cubes and then poured in the tonic. He took the drink out on to the balcony, and sat and looked out across the spectacular view.
From “Dr. No” by Ian Fleming, 1958
With the arrival of summer, it’s time to offer a cool, delicious DIY drink kit appropriate for the season: the tonic kit. High Desert Botanicals specializes in providing collections of spices used for cocktail and drink flavorings. I buy in bulk and sell at affordable prices. My kits are intended for the do-it-yourselfers and the experimenters out there who are guided by their own, unique tastes and not the trends of the masses.
I already sell a basic tonic kit in our Etsy store. While it has been very popular, it could be even better:
Better prices! By purchasing the raw materials in even larger quantities, I can offer the kits for less.
More choices! I’m adding options with more spices, different sizes, and even a DIY Gin Kit to accompany the tonic kit. Sure, you could make tonic that tastes just the stuff in those little, yellow bottles at the supermarket, but why would you want to do that? Make a tonic that stands out, that your friends will remember and ask for, and is totally your own, distinct blend. And then do something completely different next week. 
Did I mention the DIY Gin Kit? Tired of the same gin from the green bottle? Need a little less juniper and more spice flavors? Start with neutral grain spirits and add my botanicals to get just the taste you want.
History of Tonic
The British, inventors of India Pale Ale, created tonic water to improve the taste of the daily ration of quinine given to sailors and soldiers as an anti-malarial medication. Limes had long been used to prevent scurvy so adding lime and sugar to the quinine was a convenient pairing. Naturally, dry London gin soon found its way into the mix. Since malaria is endemic to tropical climates, tonic often appears in refreshing drinks from those regions.

743,510273464,"Keeping the Bastards Honest is a new investigative journalism fund launched by the Flagstaff this month. We have noticed over the years that the number of substantive reports coming through council to the Devonport-Takapuna Local Board have become less and less. There is also a marked lack of early engagement between the Government and Devonport residents, particularly on land issues that affect the area. We want to be more proactive in getting hold of the information on the spending and decision-making processes council and government bodies want to keep from the public. The trouble is that it comes at a not unsubstantial cost. The bill for our Official Act (OIA) Information request to the Ministry of Lands for documents over the sale of the Bayswater Marina reclamation was $350. And this was a relatively straightforward request. We have four OIA requests in the system at the moment and are expecting bills of between $400 to $1000 for each request to be actioned. With the furore over the planned axing of the Campbell Live current affairs show, and the subsequent surge in public support for the programme, we thought we would turn things on their head. Through the Keeping the Bastards Honest fund, local people can contribute directly to an increase in the freedom of information available to our community and the accountability of Government and Auckland Council. The Flagstaff is paid for by advertising and delivered for free so we hope people will contribute – a grass-roots response to keeping democracy alive and kicking. Every dollar will go towards Keeping the Bastards Honest. Our initial target is $2000. You can contribute online th"
744,423148709,"The design behind our SeaThread Collection was inspired by a vintage fisherman's sweater I pulled out of my father's closet. Always a conversation piece, the garment boasted a timeless pattern with thick ribbed cuffs and collars to promote thermal regulation and warmth for windy days by the water. A true multi-season garment, our sweaters are made from an incredibly soft blend that promotes comfort and versatility above all else.

It's no secret that ocean plastics are one of the biggest environmental challenges of our generation. Experts believe that, at our current rates of consumption, plastic will outnumber fish in the sea by the year 2050. Additionally, millions of pounds of oyster shells are discarded and end up in landfills every year. By developing high quality and timeless garments that promote the use of recycled materials, we hope to reduce waste, change the narrative, and do a small part in cleaning up our waterways for the next generation.
Our manufacturing partners leverage a patented nanotechnology to create rPET yarn by fusing both the recycled oyster shells and recycled water bottles. That material is then blended with some of the finest yarns on the planet adding different benefits and characteristics to the final knit garments.
Each oyster filters up to 50 gallons of seawater per day naturally regulating waterways. We've already begun partnering with a handful of organizations and non-profits committed to the well-being of oyster populations. We're proud to say that a portion of sales from each sweater will be invested in reseeding coastal oyster reefs promoting the long-term health of our inshore ecosystems.
We've partnered with world-class manufacturers who have worked tirelessly to produce the first SeaThread Sweaters. All of our partners are excited for this collection to go into production and we're scheduled for early November delivery."

Hi, my name is Aria. I am a first-time author, a mother of two, and wife to the adventurous hubby! We love nature so much that we spend most of our time outdoors with the kids. We have thrived and grown so much through interacting with nature.
In return, I wrote the story Jojo to raise awareness in kids to protect our nature.  
INTRODUCTION
Jojo is a fiction picture book about getting along with the wildlife. The main character, Jojo, is a special girl who can speak to animals. In the story, she solves the conflict between her brother and the animals. Her special ability has also brought her to the treasure keeper of the rainforest. 
Jojo's father hunted animals for his family.
Jojo is strange among her people because she doe not eat meat.
She accidentally discovered her ability to talk to animal
Abhi need to learn to get along with the animals.
*It is a 30 pages fully illustrated digital picture book, best for age 6 and above. 
The main character, Jojo, is based on the image of my daughter, Boo. Jojo is the virtual image of Boo, who is going on a mission to save the rainforest.
Watch the story of Boo here. 
Jojo is UNIQUE, LOVING and BRAVE. 
Jojo is UNIQUE among her people, because she doesn't eat meat. That is because she wants to protect the animal. Jojo is LOVING. She risked her life to save her brother from the animal. Jojo is BRAVE to negotiate with the animals when she was rescuing her brother.
We hope to bring the positive energy to kids all around the world!
 OUR MISSION 
We want to raise awareness in kids to protect mother nature through the picture book Jojo. We would like to encourage kids to immerse themselves in mother nature as well.
Besides that, we also pay attention to kid’s wellbeing. We want to encourage kids to be unique, courageous, and adventurous at the same time.
 CONTRIBUTE TO Mother Nature 
Rainforests are an important part of life on our planet. They provide us with the air we breathe, and they are home to plants and animals too. Yet, towards the end of 2019 and the start of 2020, forest fires started to destroy the forests of the Amazon, Australia, and Indonesia.
We have lost several forests within half a year, but to regrow a forest takes decades. With all the forest we have lost, the time to start regrowing them is now.
Half of your pledge will go to Danau Girang Field Centre (DGFC). DGFC is a collaborative research centre located in the east coast of Sabah and dedicated to the applied conservation of tropical ecosystems and the effective management of wildlife in a fragmented landscape. FOLLOW THEM HERE.
By repairing areas of rainforest, we will be increasing forest connectivity which is an essential part of saving the orangutan and other endangered species.
Danau Girang Field Centre will manage the donation and use our donation to regrow the rainforest on appropriate sites.
The number of trees planted will be monitored and reported back. Danau Girang Field Centre will track the growth of the planted trees. We will get the updates on the amount of carbon taken out of the atmosphere, as well as other social, environmental, and economic impacts.
EXTRA VALUE!!!!
 We decided to go green this time. We do not want to cut down any tree to print our book since we are going to regrow the rainforest. 
In addition to thank you for supporting our Kickstarter project, we will be adding another ebook in the pledge!
Jojo features indigenous people, Sun Bear, Clouded Leopard, Proboscis Monkey, Orangutan, and some other endangered animals. Your pledge will include an ebook that introduces the endangered animals of Borneo that were featured in Jojo.
Let’s learn about the endangered animals of Borneo with Jojo!

Thanks for checking out the project!
Hopefully you are here because you are interested and a fellow fan of PlayStation games. The short of it, I am looking to produce an unnofficial book I have created for fans of Sony and the original PlayStation. Inside the book are nearly 1000 screenshots from games released on the original PlayStation, filling over 700 pages. The focus of this book are on all the games Sony Computer Entertainment of America (SCEA) published during the complete life of the system. That spans games from 1995 all the way through the twilight years (and beyond, really) in 2005. Giant screenshots, no fluff, all nostalgia.
What is it?
Sony's PlayStation: A Chronological Visual Retrospective of SCEA Published Games from 1995-2005 is a mouthful, but its a book. An 8"" x 6"" book covering 151 different games, 700+ pages, nearly 1000 screenshots, and that's it. There are plenty of other excellent people and publishers producing quality retro gaming content with interviews, developer stories, history and more. This book isn't that. I see this being a companion book for fans looking for more simple, nostalgic content. My goal is to let the games and your own memories tell the story. The filter and scope is that all the titles inside this book were games published by SCEA themselves. It is organized by release date, so with each page you see the progression and evolution of the technological feats and eras of the original PlayStation.
Cover Mock
Inside Mock
Why?
I am posing this question, but I don't have a real answer. Basically, I just want a copy of this book for myself. I am hoping there are enough others interested in it so I can actually print it and have one. I've been a long time fan of Retro Gamer magazine and Retro Micro Games Action magazine. They do an excellent job covering the classic games, and sometimes those full page and double page blown up images tell a whole story. That was the inspiration for this project. 
Personally, I have always loved what Sony has done. I know many people swear by and pray at the alter of Nintendo, but call me a blasphemer, there is no better publisher than Sony. Now I will admit not all of their games are gold, but they take chances on all styles of games. They do unique and weird games, AAA games, hardcore, casual, everything. I love that about them, and I love the partnerships they make doing that. Some people think I am crazy, but I know plenty of others agree with me. This project is for us.
Is my favorite game XYZ in this? That game was sooooooo good!
Maybe? If SCEA published it, it's in here. This is EVERY game they supported and published here in North America. Nothing is missing from their catalog, but if your favorite game is Street Fighter Alpha 3 or Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2, then you'll be disappointed. Is your favorite game PaRappa the Rapper or Twisted Metal 2? They're here! Is it Final Fantasy VII? You're in luck! Squaresoft (at the time) had a publishing deal and SCEA was the publisher here in NA. If this project does well, I would love to do smaller follow-up companions like Capcom's PlayStation, Konami's PlayStation, Namco's PlayStation and more. I hope that clears up the direction of the project.
I backed the project but what does ""plus any additional unlocks from campaign progress"" mean? Is the goal not actually $2300?
Good eye! I want this project to exist, so that is how I built this campaign. The printing quote I got was the smallest print run I could do. Meeting this goal would produce an awesome softcover book for us all to have, but I personally want to see more. The more support this campaign gets the more it will upgrade what you all get as a reward with no extra costs required from you. The ultimate version I want to produce that I got a quote for would be a matte finished cover with unique spot finish UV bound hardcover book with a cool slipcase to protect it all (this is happening!). I have an idea of some fun ""memory card"" bookmarks (and we made them!). If it gets REAL crazy, additional pages with more screenshots, improved paper quality, etc (and we did this!). All funds will allow the project to grow and improve and benefit everyone getting a copy of the book. This is also factoring in Kickstarter taking their 5% and other taxes and processing fees that come with completing projects in this platform. 
How did you find these games and data? Are you sure this is everything?
Yeah, I think so. I did a lot of research and organizing info and data for this project. I don’t even know if i could factor how much time was spent total. To start, I found two conflicting lists of complete games released for the original PlayStation along with inaccurate release date information. I merged the two and found some more inaccuracies within that new list. I then used two separate data-based websites (Moby Games and the PlayStation DataCenter) to cross check and validate info. I then took all that data and read through old issues of EGM, Game Informer, GamePro, GameFan, Game Players and more to be a 3rd source of validation for release dates and details. Everything I now have is as accurate as it can be, at this point. For fun, I also included Sony's SCUS identifier with each game... just because.
Now, is there a chance I still missed something? Sure. I hope I didn't, but if I did, I'd love to know about it so I can correct and/or update my data and be as complete as I can be. I know I didn't miss NBA ShootOut 99, because that game doesn't exist. It was cancelled just weeks before release and you can technically find a playable build of it, but it wasn't ever officially in the wild. It was one of the last NBA games SISA/989 Studios made before Killer Games took over developing for NBA ShootOut 2001. That's info you'll have at your fingertips if you get a copy of this book.
I have a question, what do I do?
Reach out to me here on Kickstarter or find me on social media. Twitter and Instagram I am @darrenhupke, Facebook you can search for Darren Hupke. I think that's it, really. You can leave a comment on this project page, as well. I will address or answer any questions coming my way as quickly as I can.

748,895327641,"As someone who has recently started a fine arts career I have experienced the ups and downs of trying to make it in the art world. It is when you get that one big approval that makes all of the rejection notices worthwhile. That is where I am at this moment. My submission of a exhibit proposal was accepted by the Cleveland Botanical Gardens for a show in their gallery space. I am being asked to hold an exhibit during their ""Big Spring"" event which will take place from March 21st through April 27th , 2015. The kicker is they would really like me to display my most recent work of extreme close-ups of butterfly wings which I do not have printed out. 
So I am almost there. I have the images ready to be printed. I have the venue lined up to host the exhibit. I just need your help to have my artwork printed out so I can hold an awesome exhibit. 
I have switched from photo paper to having my photographs printed as aluminum metal prints. This is a process in which the printing company uses a special photo paper to reverse print the image I give them. They place it on a specially coated sheet of aluminum and then it is heated up and pressed together, fusing the photographic image directly into the aluminum. The image is in the aluminum, not sitting on it. This makes it very durable, water proof, scratch resistant, and with a very long archival duration.
The only downside for using metal prints for a large show is that they are much more expensive to have printed out than traditional photo paper prints. However, the added benefits of metal prints mentioned above far outweigh the added expense. This is the reason for presenting you with this fundraiser.

10  8 x 12 macro insect framed metal prints = $ 600.00
10  20 x 30 macro butterfly wing framed metal prints = $ 1,800.00

749,1238173614,"WE'VE INTRODUCED A STRETCH GOAL WITH BONUS REWARDS!
Since every dollar raised through Kickstarter will help to make this project a success we're introducing a stretch goal of $25,000.
How does a stretch goal work?   If we're able to reach our stretch goal of $25,000, every backer that has pledged more than $24, will receive a bonus reward! This will apply to BOTH existing backers and new backers! This is our way of saying thank you for such a successful campaign.
     WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED?
MISHAP! Brewing Company didn’t always look like this. We were once named after a local creek, and people came through our doors knowing we offered well-devised, unique craft beers that had a story to tell. We are the little guy—the home-grown, local favorite that refused to quit when the big guy came to town. Today, we are still offering the same great-tasting beer and communal gathering place—but this time, our name pays homage to the occasional “whoops!” moments and happy mistakes that have made us who we are.
Want to learn more about the backstory of our name change? Here's some of the coverage: Buffalo Bulletin Story - Wyoming Magazine Story - Casper Star Tribune Story 
** For those new to KickStarter, you are able to manage your reward and change it. We will be adding new reward packages to allow you to bundle multiple products. After the campaign ends, you will be asked to send us your address and sizing. This information must be received by December 14th in order to have it produced for Christmas delivery. Thanks!! **
Our brewery was originally kick-started on this very platform 4 short years ago, and we're back to enlist the help of our friends and neighbors so we can continue brewing under a new name. See our original project here: click this.
 WHERE WILL YOUR FUNDING GO?
Simply put, it's covering the cost to relaunch our operation under a new name. There are so many costs associated with changing the name of an existing business including: lawyers, bankers, designers, documentation, new pints and growlers, updated signs and letterhead, website, printed kegs, printed apparel, and other merchandise.  With your funding, you get sweet new brew gear and we get to keep doing what we do best - make really damn good beer.
WHY KICKSTARTER?
You supported us before, and we thought this would be the best platform for us to launch and promote our new name with our friends and neighbors. We couldn't have done it without you the first time, and we are humbly asking for your help again.
Remember, Kickstarter is an all or nothing funding mechanism.  If we fall short of our $20,000 goal in 30 days, you aren't charged and we also get nothing. BUT, if we go over our goal, we will roll out some sweet stretch rewards. Getting to $20,000 would be ideal, but extra funds will be used to cover the cost of the things we list above and produce all of the new merchandise.
MORE ABOUT US
The brewery started as a dream over 7 years ago, back when we were creating our craft as small batch home brews in our garage.  In the fall of 2011, our team sat down and began to turn the dream into reality and brewery began to take shape. We leased a historic building in downtown Buffalo just a block from the local landmark stream, Clear Creek.  We put deposits down on shiny new equipment and threw caution to the wind. 
Community support has been incredible, as word (and taste) got out, everything began to move from a dream to reality.  Now, as we continue to grow, we look forward to distributing our craft beer regionally.

751,911438885,"Hello! My name is Will Eskridge. I'm a working artist here in Athens, GA and I'm building my Art Studio/Gallery.
I've been making art in some form ever since I was kid. One of my earliest and fondest memories is of me fingerpainting in pre-school. Over the years, I have painted/made art in various non-dedicated spaces. Closets, basements, bedrooms and kitchens. The time has come to build a dedicated studio for which I can work, exhibit and store my art. My goals for this project:
Goal # 1: Finish building my art studio in order to have an appropriate place to work, store and exhibit my art projects.
Goal # 2: Make the space available from time to time as an exhibit space for fellow artists and friends.
Upon completion of the studio, I will have a Grand Opening Reception featuring all the work I created as rewards for your funding. The reception will be a fun filled night with food, drinks and entertainment. The event will be filmed and will be available to view online for backers that cannot attend. All backers are exclusively invited!
The funds are strictly for the materials and labor to finish building the studio. Any extra funding beyond the initial $3500 will be donated to Athens Canine Rescue.
At this time, I have the foundation and flooring system built. The next step in construction is the final step and includes putting up the four walls, doors, windows, roof, paint and trim. It's the biggest step and most expensive. I've made a lot of headway already and I just need this last push to finish it up so I can make art like a madman, shave in my bathroom again and LeeLoo can use her tail as a play toy for the cats instead of a paintbrush!
""Hello, Doc? Yeah, Eskridge here. I just dipped my paintbrush in my coffee and took a gulp of turpentine"" results of painting in the kitchen...

752,946976369,"The Story
Bogalusa is a narrative short film following Jeremiah, a young veteran, who returns to his hometown and tries to reconnect with his 8-year-old daughter, Lindsay. He struggles to rebuild his life in Louisiana, one of the poorest states in the USA with limited employment options, and to overcome his feelings of abandonment and loss.
Veterans are often viewed as strong and confident men, who've courageously protected their country and now deserve to rest. However, at home they face new challenges: the necessity to find a meaningful direction in life and to re-establish connections with people who have gotten used to living without them. It calls for an even greater courage - to be vulnerable. 
Our team
Bogalusa is a short thesis film produced by students of Brooklyn College. Collectively we have worked on over fifty films, some of which screened at Berlinale Talents, Cannes Young Director Festival, USA Film Festival, Buffalo International Film Festival, FirstGlance, New York Short Film Festival, Hollywood International Film Festival and Austin Web Fest, among others.

Jadzia is a MFA candidate at Brooklyn College's Barry R. Feirstein Graduate School of Cinema. While at Feirstein, she has been able to work on dozens of short films, music videos, television shows and commercials nationwide. Most recently, Jadzia was selected as the cinematographer on Half Life, a television series created with the help of the New York City Mayor’s Office of Media and Entertainment, airing on NYC Media.

Currently, Elizabeth is finishing up her MFA in Producing at Brooklyn College Feirstein Graduate School of Cinema and works freelance in film and as a tenured Adjunct Lecturer at The Fashion Institute of Technology. 
Richard Levin, producer
Richard, a young and aspiring filmmaker, started working as a junior producer for a film production company based in Frankfurt and Berlin focused on advertising. After almost three years he left his hometown in order to pursue an MFA in film producing at the Feirstein Graduate School of Cinema with a concentration on narrative storytelling, long and short. His works were screened at the Berlinale Film Festival’s Hessen Talents in 2014 and 2015. Over the course of seven years he has produced nearly 50 different projects varying from commercials, music videos, short films and features to webisodes. His international background and experience enables him to think outside the box and implement techniques and strategies to bring a project to its highest possible outcome.
Director’s statement from Ksenia Tolmazin
As the mother of an 8-year-old daughter, I want to make films where young girls can claim their agency, even in the presence of marines. The retired veteran is able to reconnect to his daughter only when he becomes vulnerable and equal, even though it only lasts for a few moments. Despite the father’s absence in her life, there is still hope for them to connect in their own way. This story is about fatherhood without a traditional link to a mother, a figure who is intentionally left out of the frame.
Another theme we touch upon is the socio-economic conditions in America. Louisiana is one of the poorest states in the US, and some of its residents have very limited options; for many of them joining the army is the best solution. But when veterans come back home to dying towns, they can feel abandoned, lost and purposeless. However, there is a place for love in any dysfunctional family, in any dying town.
  Why we need your support
We received a $10,000 grant from the New York Mayor's Office of Film and Television, and an additional $6,000 through private donors. 
We're coming to Kickstarter to raise another $10,000 to cover travel to Louisiana and provide housing for ourcrew members, as well as to pay the local talent for their work. Part of the funds raised will allow us to rent the film equipment and hire local crew members in Louisiana. The film production also involves risks associated with shooting around alligators, on moving vehicles and in the bayou waters. To guarantee safety of our cast and crew additional expenses are required.

753,65875184,"Let’s face it: Traditional dress shirts suck.  
Your dresser is filled with shirts that are made using old technology and even older designs. They trap your sweat, causing you to look bad and feel uncomfortable. Prone to stains, your shirts make you avoid everyday activities that are enjoyable. On top of all that, none of those shirts reflect who you are. Boring, boring, bad.
We designed our Collarfree Future premium dress shirts for optimal comfort and we added all the necessary features to let you accelerate your dynamic life. It's a product for essentialists who want to go through their day without the worry of their clothing. Your dress shirt will reflect your values of sustainability, paying fair wages, and improving the quality of your life through what you wear.
1) Temperature Regulating: Using technology that NASA uses in space suits, our fabric controls your body temperature.
Our shirt keeps your skin happy, at the temperature it should be. The difference is noticeable and can change your day. Our fabric uses Phase-Change Materials (PCMs) to pull heat away from your body and actually store it in the shirt - like a battery. We call this micro encapsulating heat cells. This gives our shirts the ability to release the heat back to you when you return to the AC of your house or office. 
You can zoom into the fibers. This is where the micro encapsulated heat cells are.
2) Stain Resistant: No more coffee stains, wine stains and sweat stains. You are moving fast, reaching your ever-growing goals. You should not be slowed down by stains.
3) Moisture Management: With fabric 18 times more breathable than normal shirting, our shirts were engineered to wick the moisture away from you to control your sweat. Whether you are presenting to the board, out for cocktails, or dining with the queen, we have you covered. 
4) Full Body Movement Unlocked: Your dynamic life needs your movements to remain unrestricted. The shirt will support you while you take the thousands of movements that fill your day. 
4-way stretch allows for unrestricted movement.
5) Wrinkle Resistant: Rest easy and travel easier knowing that your shirt is wrinkle resistant. Plus, we do not use toxic chemical coatings to achieve wrinkle resistance, so you can feel confident that the shirt is much more sustainable than your normal shirts. Live without irons. 
The wrinkle resistance is in the knit itself. Live with a bit more ease.
6) Machine Washable and Dryable: No more dry cleaning. It's 2020, dry cleaning should not be a concern. Plus we don't like the chemicals that dry cleaning services use. 
Care: Machine wash cold. Tumble dry low.
Hear from our Founder, Chad Heegaard on how Cheegs came to be.
PLAY

1) Collar Free: We found optimal comfort to be collarless so we got rid of the collar. Let your neck breathe, look amazing in a suit, do not wear ties, and do not conform. Our style allows you to be seen through the crowd. You were not born to fit in.  
2) Buttonless Look: In our search for optimal comfort, we wanted a sleek look. We made the buttons invisible. Using high quality recycled snap buttons, our shirt makes it easier than ever to snap in and out of comfort. 
3) Superior Fit: Cheegs is a human centered company and we design our shirts to work with you, not against you. Our fitted shirts are designed to be versatile. Tucked or untucked, no matter the occasion. 
1) The Environmentally Conscious Minimalist: You prefer quality over quantity and understand the negative impacts of fast fashion but do not know what to do.
2) The Comfort Connoisseur: You look for comfort above all else. You can spot innovation and appreciate clothing made from space fabric designed for optimal comfort.
3) The Essentialist: You are an essentialist who does not want to worry about stains, sweats, discomfort, and wrinkles. You want to go through your day with more ease.
4) The Principled Leader:  You don't remember the last time you wore a tie but yet your closet is filled with neck restricting collared shirts. You know you were not born to fit in.
5) The Supportive Enthusiast: You love supporting small businesses who want to change the world.
Our matching masks look slick so you can look the part, and keep people safe around you!
As part of our ongoing effort to have a positive impact we are including comfortable matching masks with each of our dress shirts. We believe it is our responsibility to look out for, help and support one another. We hope that this is just one of many small gestures that we can make during this time.
Discover our size guide. The ultimate shirt experience starts with the fit. At Cheegs, we offer two carefully designed styles to help our customers find an ideal match. Measurements are in inches.  
Our Classic fit is a more relaxed cut and gives more room in the body and arms.
Our Slim fit shirts are made to be fitted for a more custom made, tailored feel.
Neck: Measure around the base of your neck, just below your Adam’s apple. Hold one finger under the tape measurer to ensure a comfortable fit.
Sleeve: Place your hand on your hip, have someone measure from the center back of your neck along your shoulder and elbow to your wrist. If you do not have someone to help you, take a shirt that fits well in the sleeve and measure it in the same way.
Chest: Measure your chest around the widest part of your chest and back, typically 1” below your armpits. Take a breath in to make sure you have room and the shirt is not too constricting.
Waist: This will be different than the waist measurement you use to buy pants. Stand naturally in a relaxed position and measure around your waist at your belly button.
*Shirt length is not a body measurement, but the measurement of the actual shirt, from the center back of the neck.
We are proud to partner with a progressive leader in the areas of quality and sustainability in Taiwan. The company follows the labor act in Taiwan and goes above and beyond. Employees have free lunches, snacks, and beverages provided daily. They have paid vacation too, of course.  Their understanding of the importance of sustainability can be shown through their Oeko-Tex certificate. This means the manufacturing process complies with the conditions of non-polluting air, non-polluting water, waste disposal and noise reduction. We are lucky to have found such amazing partners.
These are the technical designs from our first couple prototypes. Fun to see how it has evolved.

“DANCE IN THE USA”
A Tribute to the Music that Made All Americans Move their Feet
Friday, August 17, 2012, 8:30 PM
At Ford Amphitheatre in Hollywood
Pacific Ballet Dance Theatre, formerly known as the Media City Ballet,
recently changed its name to reflect its growth from its Burbank roots
(Los Angeles, CA) June 25, 2012 – Pacific Ballet Dance Theatre (PBDT), formerly known as the Media City Ballet Company since its formation in 2001 in Burbank, brings Dance in the USA to the Ford Amphitheatre on Friday, August 17, 2012, 8:30 p.m. Known for its preservation of ballet’s aesthetic and standards of excellence created and established by the dancers and choreographers of the Ballet Russe and the development of new work that draws on the creative talents of contemporary choreographers and composers, PBDT has chosen to branch out from their traditional European roots to pay homage to the American experience with an explosive dance and music retrospective.
Dance in the USA employs a compilation of works by iconic musical artists such as Aaron Copland, Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman, to name a few. This exciting retrospective shows how American music influenced dance, moving from decade to decade. It starts with a  Rodeo and Hoedown and then moves to the Cakewalk with Ragtime and the Charleston. We'll listen to music that made Ellington take an A-train into Harlem and we'll dance to a live pianist on stage as we Swing and Boogie Woogie in the ‘40s. The twist and shouts of the 50s will make us rock around the clock with a hound dog as the beat generation snaps it's fingers.  We then step into the 60s where there will be dancing in the streets with my guy to the sounds of Detroit as a blind man sees a pretty woman.  As the Summer wind blows through the Ford we'll do it our way as dancer/singer Chris Trousdale sings and dances as Joe stands by the bar. Soon you will want to jump onto the stage with our dancers as we step in line into the 1970s with Disco music. The 80s will show you why it will always love you like a lucky star as you feel like a superstar.
This new work, the vision of PBDT’s artistic director Natasha Middleton, utilizes American music as a foundation to present the variety and evolution of dance in a style similar in manner to that of the Ballet Russe. Male dancers share equal billing with female dancers and are coached theatrically to re-enact the personality of each era. The Ballet Russe style trains dancers to fully utilize their bodies athletically and theatrically. Copland’s “Rodeo” was composed for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. The choreographers’ strong connection to ballet will provide an authentic portrayal of the folk style to the audience. This association gives each dance a very sincere yet unforced quality allowing the audience to relate and appreciate the feel of the time.
PBDT attracts first-class talent from around the world, including Armenia, Asia, Russia, and Spain, with dancers who have previously worked with such companies as American Ballet Theatre, Armenian National Opera Ballet, the Bolshoi Theatre Ballet, the Kirov Opera and Ballet Company, the Korean National Ballet, and the Chicago Ballet. In addition, PBDT has worked with and developed many talented local dancers. Over 30 professional and company dancers will perform in Dance in the USA, many of whom have their own professional careers with acting, dancing, singing and choreography and can be seen dancing and acting on TV, music videos, and feature films. Featured dancers include Chris Trousdale, who also sings during the performance. Trousdale was a member of the popular boy band Dream Street and is in the new Disney show “Shake it Up” and is currently recording a dance/pop CD; Alexander Fost from “So You Think You Can Dance;” and Allan McCormick who has just come off of performing in “La Rêve” in Las Vegas as a dancer, acrobat and aerialist.
“When the audience watches this particular show, I think they are going to have a really good time going through all the eras. They’re going to be feeling how fun it has been from the rodeo days all the way through to the millennium,” explains Natasha Middleton, PBDT’s artistic director.
Tickets start at $15-$35 and $12 for full-time students with ID and children 12 and under. VIP packages start at $65 and include premium seating and a pre-performance reception. Tickets are available at www.FordTheatres.org or (323) 461-3673 (for non-visual media (323) GO 1-FORD). For groups of 8 or more, please call (323) 769-2147.

Hello, my name is Natascha von Hirschhausen. While I was studying fashion design at Kunsthochschule Berlin Weißensee, I got the chance to travel to Bangladesh with ""Local-International"". I was in Dhaka for one week, where everything is incredibly full and loud. After this experience, coming to the workshop of ""Living Blue"" in Rangpur was literally a breath of fresh air. 
To see the amazing handcraft, that is performed by the artisans and the calm, respectful atmosphere charmed me right away. The excellence in handcraft and the self organized fair trade organization showed the strength and skill of these people in an enchanting manner. I spend the most wonderful hours working and experimenting with the artisans, seeing the village and their way of life.
When Mishael got in touch with me after I founded my ethical fashion label ""Natascha von Hirschhausen"" and asked, if I would be willing to collaborate with the artisans of ""Living Blue"" I felt teleported back in time and space to the calm, skillful people I got to know on the production site. Of course I was more than happy to start working on a new collection with them. 
""I am honored to work with these amazing, strong artisans now.""
Our journey from Bangladesh to Fashion Week Berlin
THE PRODUCTION 
The workshop of Living Blue in Bangladesh helps to sustain the unique handcraft and the life of the people on the countryside in Bangladesh. By working eye to eye with our artisans we preserve the one of a kind handcraft and make it accessible to the world. We strongly believe that the best way of development assistance is paying a fair price to our artisans. 
The whole production is about fair trade where the artisans not only get a fair wage and democratically manage and run their own businesses, but also have total control over profits. The surplus generated by these various social enterprises contribute to the general well-being of local communities and help to create sustainable social, cultural and economic life.
Our collection is proudly made in Bangladesh

All the indigo used for dyeing purposes in this textile collec­tion has been produced in Bangladesh and is of the highest quality. 
Our collaboration is about tapping the value of this renewable resource in the existing micro-ecology. Natural dyes contribute to more environmentally conscientious production systems, as well as sustainable local communities. Plus the finished garment, which you wear on your skin, will not contain any oil-based chemistry.
Indigo production can be integrated into the agricultural cycle and does not have to replace food, rather it can be expanded and complement existing cropping systems and contribute to increased yields. 
Indigo production in Bangladesh
OUR PHILOSOPHY
We strongly believe the best way of development assistance is paying a fair price to our artisans, that create one of a kind handcraft. Empowering the people and their skills, by providing our costumer with perfect, one of a kind garments, is our main goal.
Natural dyes, compostable fibers and one of a kind handcraft combined with innovative designs is our way of showing, that garments can be fair, eco-friendly and fashionable.
The future is about mindful innovation combined with traditional handcraft skills, renewable resources and high quality fibers. This adds up to the perfect product. This is what we stand for.
For her future driven thinking Natascha got nominated for the ""Bundespreis Ecodesign"" in 2016 and 2017. ""Bundespreis Ecodesign"" is an award by the german government acknowledging ecological and innovative design.
Nomination for ""Natascha von Hirschhausen"" in category ""Produkt"" - we will know more on 27th of November
  THE HANDCRAFT
The brand LIVING BLUE stands for high quality, hand-made products, made by artisans in Bangladesh, based on optimum technical recall. The key technique lies in natural dyes, as well as Shibori and Kantha. 
Shibori is a special way of dyeing the fabric to get lively, one of a kind patterns. First of all the whole fabric piece is stitched through and through. Then you pull the threads to put pressure on certain spots. Then you dye the whole piece. After that you extract the threads and get a unique lively pattern, since the dye could not reach where the threads were pulled.

THE OUTFITS ONE BY ONE
For this first collaboration we created three outfits inspired by water - the cradle of life - in the shape of ice, steam and the ocean.
""As the designer I love to wear this outfit, because it is chic, elegant and comfortable. This pant suit gives me the chance to show business wear in an easy, professional and modern way.""
This outfit is inspired by the graphicness of ice. The clear lines make this pant suit a unique, handcrafted companion for modern business. 
""Ice"" combines a modern day pant suit, which is made of pure, hand spun cotton, with a one of a kind silk blouse, that has a handcrafted Shibori pattern. All pieces are dyed naturally by the artisans of Living Blue with Indigo, that is grown locally and produced fair. 
GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT ""ICE""
Blazer and pants have pockets. 
The pants have an elastic band closure. 
The silk blouse is finished with french seams, giving it the best quality. 
All items should be cold washed by hand to secure the longevity.
Thanks to innovative no-waste patterns, these items do not cause waste.
""This is the perfect summer outfit. It is light, chic, airy and elegant. In different combinations the pieces can be everything from day to evening wear.""
Our ""steam"" is inspired by the airy clouds of mist. The light and flowing silk embodies the ease of steam. Wrap pants and jacket are made of a silk and cotton blend, which has a hand sewn hem. They are also purely dyed naturally with Myrobalan fruit, which is locally sourced in Bangladesh. 
Our ""steam"" blouse made of pure silk is also dyed naturally with Myrobalan fruit, which is locally sourced and has a hand stitched pattern in the front. This exceptional handcraft takes about two weeks to hand sew, by one of our artisans in Bangladesh and embodies the steam clouds.
GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT ""STEAM""
The wrap pants have pockets. 
The pants are size variable, since they are to be wrapped around the body - as is the jacket. Jacket and pants have a hand stitched hem. 
The silk blouse is finished with french seams, giving it the best quality. 
An extra button on the blouse secures the bra from showing.
Thanks to innovative no-waste patterns, these items do not cause waste.
""Ocean is made to be an elegant one of a kind evening outfit. These unique silk pieces can be worn to any evening event. Plus the skirt can be matched with a t-shirt and become the perfect companion for the summer time.""
This outfit is inspired by the deep sea. Dark green is shimmering with blue on a softly glowing silk. 
The Shibori handcraft creates this lively but subtle pattern on the draped blouse. The colours are dyed naturally with Pomgranate and Indigo, which is sourced locally in Bangladesh.
GENERAL INORMATION ABOUT ""OCEAN""
The straight black skirt has a slit in the front.
Draped silk blouse with shibori pattern has a detail on the shoulder.
All items should be cold washed by hand to secure the longevity.
Thanks to innovative no-waste patterns, these items do not cause waste.
How can we make this happen?

758,1323303646,"Hi there! I'm Kristin, the founder of Seamly.co. We encourage women to engage with their clothing -- learn where it came from, who made it, and why that matters to people and planet.
A few months ago, our community co-created this amazing sweatshirt, dubbed the ""Moto Sweatshirt."" We swapped design ideas, voted on colors and details, and collectively created the raddest sweatshirt ever. 
But, we need your help to create it. We're a small company, trying to meet fabric minimums for this AMAZING, (seriously) warm, Canadian-knitted fleece. We need to raise at least $10,000 before we can order all of the fabric needed to make the Moto Sweatshirt. 
REWARDS
The Seamly.co Tee  |  We created this tee from scratch, here in Colorado, using a rayon/lycra fabric knitted in the USA. They're SUPER comfy, durable, and are the perfect length for shorts or leggings. See our sizing chart here.
THE MOTO SWEATSHIRT  |  It looks sharp. It feels warm. It's a sweatshirt that can be worn anywhere without shame. Cuffs on the sleeves and waist to keep the cold out, molded zippers on the pockets and front, cowl neck that can be worn two ways. Sewn with durability and longevity in mind, right here in Colorado. See our sizing chart here. 
SIZES: S, M, L, XL
VIEW OUR LOOKBOOK
AND, FOR EVERYONE  |  ALL of our backers will get to see the Moto Sweatshirt come to life, through a short film showcasing our people and manufacturing. It's our way of including you in the process, and sharing our deep appreciation for made-in-the-USA.
To learn more about us and see what we do, check out our online home, Seamly.co.

759,127069085,"Hi there! I’m Lisa, author and psychotherapist, and I am launching my second book on Kickstarter and I am hoping that you will help me help you!
In our fast-paced, always-checking-our-phones modern world that’s full of pings and dings and distractions, we are on sensory overload. Add in a global pandemic and we are all experiencing what I share with my psychotherapy clients as “soul exhaustion.” Our souls are tired.  We are burnt out. We look around and are like “where’s the hope?” Our own inner light – can easily feel like it’s hardly a flicker.
Yet we know we aren’t meant to live this way! This is no way to live!
So what can we do? We need soul breaks throughout our day to come back home to ourselves and find our joy again. Sounds great right? But I bet your second thought was “so how do I do get from here to there?”
Well, let me introduce you to my second book: Your Light is Rising: Kindling the Courage of Your Soul.

Your Light is Rising is filled with short, sacred poetry, practices, and reflections that follow the rhythm the day to nourish your soul, soothe your nervous system, and inspire you to listen within to the wisdom of your soul – to heal that soul exhaustion – and inspire you to say YES to the wisdom within YOU in micro moments throughout the day!

Dawn calls forth hope to blossom in your body and soul, morning invites you to practice courage, midday gently challenges you to redefine strength, afternoon asks you to plant seeds of compassion, and evening readies you for a restful sleep with soothing words of peace.
This will be a book that you can open up at any moment in your day -- for a soul break … where you can breathe and reconnect to YOU – your divine wisdom….with inspiration that’s like honey for your soul.
Instead of inundating our senses with mindless social media that is just there to get us to click more, stay longer, and stay zoned out, this book will take you out of the online world and into YOUR inner landscape to kindle the light within you!
I have the book completely written, but I need your help to bring it to print. By backing this project you will be helping me get the book professionally designed, edited, and printed – and into your hands where it belongs!
While the book is the main reward for backers (hey, it’s why you are here!) check out all of the rewards including joining me for an online Zoom poetry reading with sharing and Q&A or have your name printed in in the acknowledgements in every copy of the book.
I’ve written Your Light is Rising because we are all meant to listen to the wildness of our souls, not just the pings and dings on our phones while zoning out on the couch.  I have filled Your Light is Rising with soulful poetry and body-centered reflections and practices that you can easily do in your everyday life….so instead of soul exhaustion you have soul exhilaration, instead of being in “fight or flight” all the time, you build your capacity for “soften and soothe” more often. Doesn’t that sound like what you need? It’s what we ALL need right now! 

So click that green “back this project” button and come and kindle your inner courage so your light can shine, so hope blossoms, and so peace settles in our souls and in our world.
Oh, and just so you know, after you select your reward level you will have the chance to ""add on"" to your pledge.  The two add ons available are extra personalized copies of Your Light is Rising and signed copies of my first book, Gems of Delight.

Thanks so much!
Lisa

760,1702200845,"For the past two years, we have been spending all of our free time and funds to build out what we consider to be a pretty cool little coffee bar.
A Damn Fine Coffee Bar, if you will.
It's a modest space - about 800 square feet - but as residents of the neighborhood, we can attest that this tiny shop is going to go a long way! As the closest coffee shop in any direction is at least a mile away, our shop will be an oasis in an otherwise barren coffee desert. Located at 3317 W Armitage in the southwest corner of Logan Square - Damn Fine Coffee Bar will offer its patrons something a little different. In addition to the amazing coffee we'll be serving from our anchor roaster - Halfwit - we will also be offering manually brewed coffees from featured roasters from around the country!
The goal is to provide our customers with consistently great coffee while offering an exciting seasonal coffee menu from Halfwit and our guest roasters. Every month we hope to introduce our customers to brands and roasts that they (or we) may have otherwise never been able to try. Additionally, we hope to offer flights and cuppings as we transition between roasters every month. And of course we will be selling bags of Halfwit beans as well as beans from our featured roasters.
Damn Fine Coffee Bar | 3317 W Armitage
But it's not all about fancy coffee.
Damn Fine Coffee Bar is a neighborhood spot that hopes to appeal to every type of coffee drinker. Meaning - if you want a pour-over from a limited quantity single-origin batch, we've got you covered. Conversely, if you want a great drip brewed cup of coffee that you can cream and sugar to your taste, we can do that too. And If you want a latte or cappuccino made with local ethically sourced milk - we've got that covered as well.
Chemex Glamour Shot
What's the space like?
We looked at about 2 dozen spaces in total but there was something magical about the abandoned beauty salon at 3317 W Armitage. It didn’t hurt that we would have great neighbors (Ground Control, Scofflaw, Sink | Swim, Best Intentions, Go Tavern, La Estrella and the Busy Beaver Button Company to name a few). And to be completely transparent, a couple of us live in the neighborhood - so selfishly we REALLY wanted a shop near by.
Make no mistake - the place was a mess. A God-awful mess. But once we started peeling back the layers - we found some really nice features. A (less than perfect) tin ceiling was hiding behind some rotten drop ceiling. A beautiful brick wall was masked by some gross drywall. And the red tinted concrete floor was unveiled after we popped up that tile.
Damn Fine - PRE build-out
Regarding the buildout - we tried to use as much of the existing materials as possible. So a lot of brick, wood, concrete and tile. It's not going to be overly designed - nor will it be super hodge-podged. We're going for a minimal / comfortable vibe offering communal AND personal seating (custom built by our pals over at C&C Woodwork Chicago). We're hoping our customers find it to be a great place to work, socialize or just relax.
Ultimately it would have been easier to be in a cookie cutter storefront on the ground floor of a condo building, but that just isn't who we are.
A really lack luster sneak peek
Why Kickstarter?
First and foremost we are going to open regardless of the Kickstarter's success... We're so close we can smell it (the beans of course)! So even if you can’t pledge - please come check us out late June / early July!
That being said - we are doing this campaign for a few reasons. The first is a bit of a ""coming out"". A lot of speculation has been going on regarding the space and what exactly is going into that storefront at 3317 W Armitage. So, we wanted to make sure YOU were the first to know.
Kickstarter really is such a great way to let all our friends, family and potential customers know what we are doing - and it gives them the opportunity to take advantage of it. We know that people have been WAITING for a shop to open up in the neighborhood. We also know that it's going to do pretty well (especially considering the lack of options) so we figured why not hook up our early supporters with some discounted coffee and limited edition merchandise?
Limited Damn Fine T's!
As far as the funds are concerned, we're at the point where we need to fine tune the build-out.  We've done most of the heavy lifting but we need to get our fixtures, cups, plates, decor and signage in place.  We're also hoping to use these funds to help with initial payroll and staffing.  
Look at all the goodies!
So that's what we're doing. We're pre-selling some coffee, offering up some limited edition t-shirts and mugs and hopefully going to generate some funds to operate at full capacity out of the gate.
We've got packages at every level - so if you have the means to offer even $5 for the cause - we're totally grateful!
So if you think you'll be frequenting the shop - this is a no-brainer. If you're on the fence - maybe this will help get you over to the neighborhood! Or maybe you're just super cool and want to support an independent business. Whatever your reason - we really appreciate the support and we hope to see you in the shop - enjoying a Damn Fine cup of coffee!
THANK YOU!
We'd like to give a shout out to all the folks who have helped us out along the way - especially Sarah Wood, Tim Pabalan, Mike O'Hara, Adam White, David Roth, Jonathan Brown, and Taylor Littrel."

If you own or know of more opportunities like this please share and pass along as I have a passion for mid-century modern design and exploration.
After the photographs are made prints will be printed, matted and delivered. For commissioned work you will receive all files on a USB presented in a professional tin. Lastly, a small fine art coffee table book with be created containing all public photographs from the project."

Nuestras metas futuras 
La comunidad de habla hispana en el mundo es siempre más numerosa, preparada y exigente. Según las estadísticas oficiales más recientes, los hispanos en Estados Unidos representan el 17,6 % de la población con un total de 56,6 millones. Cada día crece, entre ellos, el número de quien cursa estudios universitarios, post universitarios y ocupa importantes cargos en los diversos campos profesionales.
ViceVersa Magazine quiere expandirse y ser la voz de todos.
Juntos podemos lograrlo, juntos podemos demostrar el valor agregado que representa nuestro bagaje cultural, juntos podemos difundir el talento y la excelencia de nuestra gente.
Entre los proyectos que queremos realizar en los próximos meses y para los cuales te pedimos la ayuda están:
1. Una revista impresa trimestral de colección
2. La organización de eventos con panelistas de muy alto perfil, que inviten a la reflexión, el análisis y el debate. Ya realizamos el primero, en colaboración con el Departamento de Educación Continua y Programas Públicos de The Cooper Union, sobre Sátira Política y Libertad de Prensa en América Latina. Gracias a nuestros panelistas: Enrisco (Cuba), Bonil (Ecuador), Feggo (México), Rayma Suprani, Elisa Tótaro, Juan Andrés Ravell (Venezuela), pudimos promover una reflexión sobre la difícil situación en la cual trabajan muchos de nuestros comunicadores.
   Our future goals
The Spanish-speaking community in the world is growing exponentially and it is increasingly more educated and demanding. Just in the United States and according to the latest official statistics, Hispanics/Latinos represent 17.6% of the population, totaling 56.6 million people. Among them, the number of Hispanics/Latinos who go to college, achieve post-graduate degrees, and hold important positions in various professional fields, is also growing exponentially.
ViceVersa Magazine wants to continue growing so as to provide a voice for everyone.
Together, we can achieve this goal. Together, we can prove that our cultural diversity and its contributions are invaluable. Together, we can further disseminate the inspiring stories of young and established Latinos.
With your help, the projects we want to develop in the next months are:
1. A collectable quarterly printed magazine. 
2. Organizing events with renown guest speakers who will encourage reflection, analysis and debate. We’ve recently organized our first such event on Political Satire and Freedom of Speech in Latin America, in collaboration with the Department of Continuing Education and Public Programs at The Cooper Union, about. Thanks to our distinguished guest speakers: Enrisco (Cuba), Bonil (Ecuador), Feggo (Mexico), Rayma Suprani, Elisa Totaro, Juan Andrés Ravell (Venezuela), we promoted a rich discussion and reflection on the difficult situation in which many journalists work in Latin America.
¿Por qué lo hacemos? Porque...  
Creemos en quien se quema el estómago a punta de litros de café para estar despierto y crear, para quien cuelga la toga y se come la manzana, para quien le devuelve a América Latina lo bailado en cada página, lienzo, partitura, cámara o menú.
Creemos que la cultura, todo lo puede.
Creemos en el principio físico de que la energía no se crea ni se destruye, se transforma, y por eso nuestro trabajo consiste en transformar la nostalgia o el desprendimiento en la punta del lápiz.
Creemos en el español, idioma que tiene el mejor sabor a casa, el más delicioso olor a tierra propia, el más sorprendente juego de palabras y la calidez de un apurruño, cual madre que nos espera en aeropuerto.
Creemos en nosotros como un único pueblo que día a día enseña al mundo la fuerza irreverente de la ironía, el valor del ritmo y la peligrosidad de la poesía.
Si tu también crees en lo mismo, únete a ViceVersa Magazine, úsala como tu megáfono. Ayúdala a crecer.
Why do we do it? Because…
We believe in those who drink gallons of coffee to stay awake and create, in those who hang their caps and gowns and are ready to devour the Big Apple, in those who give back to Latin America everything they have gotten through each page, canvas, sheet of music, shot, and dish they make.
We believe that everything can be achieved through culture.
We believe that energy can neither be created nor destroyed; rather, it transforms from one form to another. Therefore, our work consists of transforming nostalgia and homesickness through the ink of our pens and brushes.
We believe in the Spanish language, its taste of home, evoking the smell of our land, its most amazing possibilities of wordplay, and its warmth, like that of a mother’s hug at the airport.
We believe that we belong to a unique community, which day to day teaches the world the strength of irony, the value of rhythm and the danger of poetry.
If you also believe that community, join ViceVersa Magazine, use it as your megaphone and help us grow.

765,1826314431,"My desire as an artist has always been to create my best work and have it be accessible to a wide range of people. My working process has favored consistent themes explored over multiple paintings. Because of this, I have enjoyed making paintings on a smaller scale and having them be more cost effective for collectors. 100 Trees is a natural echo of that process.
Sample Tree Painting in its Frame
   My subject matter for these paintings will be a single, monumental tree, painted in water media on a 5x7 panel. The finished paintings will be framed in an elegant black frame that hangs easily on a wall or sits as comfortably on a table. 
Ready to Work
 Starting in April, on a rolling release, I will upload finished paintings as they are produced and backers will have a chance to claim them on a first come, first served basis. If a lot of people express interest in a particular painting, I will produce variations of that theme and the resulting series of 100 paintings will become a shifting vision of artistic growth. Each piece will be ultimately unique, bold and one of a kind. Backers will also have the chance to follow along with blog posts, process videos and other tidbits as this series unfolds.
Sample Webpage for Choosing Paintings and Bonus Material
 In addition, when the 100 paintings are finished, I will ask backers to vote for their favorite piece of the entire group and the winning painting will be turned into a high quality, limited edition, hand signed and numbered giclee print. This 5x7 print will be available in both an unframed and framed variety.
Sample Print
 Thank you for your support and I am incredibly excited to see how this project unfolds.
Sample 3 Framed Paintings
Timetable:
February - Start painting with expectation of approximately 6-8 paintings per week. Begin uploading pieces with periodic reminders for backers to check available works. Begin shipping paintings to backers as they are claimed.
May - With all the work finished, tally votes for the favorite painting.
June - Deliver prints as final reward

NEW BEGINNINGS IN A TIME OF GLOBAL CRISIS !
THE LAUNCHING OF A NEW NAME & THE BIRTH OF A NEW PERSONA !
“COLETTE LUMIÈRE” (2001-2020) IS NOW “COLETTE DE LA VICTOIRE” !
HER “LABORATOIRE LUMIÈRE” IS NOW “VICTORY OF THE PEOPLE” !
VICTORY OF THE PEOPLE’S FIRST MISSION:
To help save and conserve a historic work of art: Colette’s Living Environment (1972-83).
CONTRIBUTORS OF A HUNDRED DOLLARS OR MORE WILL BE REWARDED WITH A HAND SIGNED, LIMITED EDITION C-PRINT OF 150 FROM COLETTE’S LIVING ENVIRONMENT !  

Colette is a pioneering artist whose vast and enduring body of work has both innovated and defied the categories of installation, performance, photography, and painting from the early 70s through the present. Beginning with her self-transformations and use of personas, in which she would embody historical female heroines in striking tableaux vivants, Colette’s allegorical performances have explored gender cliches, self-commodified sexuality, and the power of beauty as they coexist in the private and public realm. Her enfant terrible street-painting performances, for which she was frequently arrested, were a direct precursor to the likes of Keith Haring; her staged photographs & references to kitsch  have  had an undeniable effect on artists from Cindy Sherman to Jeff Koons; and her singular coquettish and blithe aesthetic has perennially surfaced within mainstream visual culture since the 80s.
Colette, Living Doll in Living Environment, 1978
 She has performed at legendary nightlife spaces such as the Mudd Club, Studio 54, The Palladium, and Danceteria (she created an installation for the club’s debut in 1980 with her latest motto “Fuck Art Lets Dance""), as well as designed the set and costumes for the Berlin Opera in 1985. While being exhibited in museums around the world, she embraced a conceptual commercialism through her “Reverse Pop” persona Justine (1978-82), who led the hit band Justine and the Victorian Punks (recently rereleased by DFA) and collaborated with Fiorucci on a mythic clothing line.
Using storefront windows, the streets, her home, art institutions, as well as unorthodox spaces equally as sites to be activated, Colette has shown an ambivalence to the hierarchies of the artworld. “At the core of Colette’s work is a nomadic spirit,” wrote art historian Jonathan Crary, “an openness to any media, material, or cultural network as a means of circulating images or ideas … an enduring concern to speak to multiple audiences, large and small, elite culture and mass culture.” 
Colette as Justine of the Colette is Dead Co. in the windows of K&Ö, Graz, Austria, 1979, promoting her new LP “Beautiful Dreamer” by Justine & the Victorian Punks (at that time the LP that was being promoted did not yet exist!)
Although Colette’s altered photographs, kitsch sculptures, and avant-garde performances have been widely exhibited in museums and published to great critical acclaim over the last decades Colette has always responded to the crass commercialization of art by creating works that are difficult to package and market. Nowhere was this more fully realized than in her “Living Environment,” a continually evolving artwork started in 1972 in which Colette transformed her Lower Manhattan loft into an “inner sculpture,” with herself as a living sculpture within it.  A “grotto of fantasy,” the previously dilapidated ceilings and walls were enveloped with boles of ruched silks and satins, mixed media light boxes inset into the walls like luminous reliquaries, concealed lighting, mirrors, and cascading ropes. Published in endless magazines, from Artforum to The National Enquirer, and in publications from the art history textbook “Art in Our Times” by Peter Selz (1981, Abrams Books) to the well-known travel guide“Seeing the Real New York“ by Gabriele Von Arnim (1982, Dumont), Colette’s baroque boudoir and sanctuary salon was referred to as one of New York City’s “Living National Treasures.”  
PLAY

Trailer for Colette’s video “Justine & the Boys” with an ensemble cast starring Jeff Koons and Richard Prince (Shot by Robert Polidori in her Living Environment), 1979  – available as an exclusive streaming link to backers who pledge $15 or more to this Kickstarter. 
In 1982, the late Leo Castelli arranged for this installation to be reconstructed at the Museum of Modern Art Stockholm and to be acquired as part of the museum’s permanent collection. Due to a strange twist of fate this was not realized. In 1983, the environment was dismantled, and its wall fragments and artifacts put into storage. Due to ongoing storage tribulations that have now become unmanageable, Colette’s Living Environment and other large-scale works are in great danger of disappearing.
This Kickstarter, managed by her angelic team ""People of Victory,"" will fund the continued storing of the Living Environment and some of Colette’s other major large-scale works. It is The People of Victory‘s first project! Their next mission is to  begin conservation of the Living Environment and to find it a permanent home in a museum or other art venue's collection !

THE EXPERTS ON WHY LIVING ENVIRONMENT MUST BE PRESERVED:
""I have been told that Colette's environment–and it took ten years for it to grow to what it is now–is in danger of disappearing due to the total lack of support from museums and institutions. This would be a real tragedy. It would deprive New York of one of its last poetical spots. I cannot believe that New Yorkers would allow this to happen. I refuse to think that they could be blind to art and deaf to the harmony of love. For love has nested in Colette's apartment.”
-     Arturo Schwartz, Politi Monogram, 1981
""Colette is perhaps the only person who has reached the objective sought by the artists who look for the integration of life and are. She defines both identically as her own living space.""
-     Erica Billeter, Kunsthaus Zurich,1979
""Colette 's artistic efforts have birthed a generation of creative minds who are hellbent on breaking art's boundaries- and whether they acknowledge that Colette is the mother of their universe makes no difference because her body of work is often too elusive and ever changing to pay homage to.”
-     Akeem Duncan, Quiet Lunch Mag, 2014.
""A true original, Colette has entered her fantasies to create a phenomona that's art, fashion, theater and attitude."" 
-     Jeffrey Deitch, Politi Monograph, 1981 
Colette, Real Dream, The Clocktower Gallery, New York, 1975
""The Making of Olympia"" performance at the opening night of the retrospective ""Colette - 10 Years of Work,"" Kunstverein Munster, Germany, 1981
MORE ABOUT COLETTE:
Colette’s artwork is in the collections of the Guggenheim, NY, MOCA, LA, The Brooklyn Museum, NY, Bar Harbor Museum of Art, LA, The Aldrich Museum, CT, F.I.U. Museum, Miami, The Museum Ludwig, Cologne, The Wolfsburg Museum, Wolfsburg, Germany, and The Berlinische Gallery, Berlin. In addition to these museums she has presented her work at MoMA PS1, NY, The New Museum, NY, The Grey Art Gallery, NY, The Musee D'art Moderne, Lausanne, The Neue Gallery, Vienna, The Museum of Contemporary Art Houston, TX, The Berlin Kunstverein, The Munich Kunstverein, The Munster Kunstverein, the Museum of Modern Art, Finland, and the Musee National De Montreal, among many others.
In 2006 Colette was the recipient of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation. In 1984 she was invited by DAAD to live in Berlin. She has also received grants from CAPS (1975), National Endowment for the Arts (1976/1985), Lothringerstrasse Atelier, Munich (1986), Pollock-Krasner Foundation (2004),  New York Academy of Art (2007), Marie Walsh Sharpe Art Foundation (2007), Joan Mitchell Foundation (2013), and Warhol Foundation (2013).
Over the last several decades Colette has created different personas, which draw on her own life as a vehicle for creating performances, artworks, and large-scale installations. In 1978 she staged her own death at the Whitney Museum and resurrected as Justine of the Colette is Dead Co. (1978-82). Labeled a “Reverse Pop” artist, her first living persona Justine commented on the contradictions of art and commerce through the creation of products inspired by Colette’s look and vision, and by posing as a rock star and as the executor of her former self’s estate. Mata Hari & the Stolen Potatoes (1984-5) became her new muse after moving to Berlin, a city of great mystery and intrigue when the wall was still up. She morphed into  the Countess Reichenbach (1986-89) during  her stay in Munich, where the great King Ludwig once reigned. In the 90’s, NYC became once again Colette’s permanent headquarters. She  renamed  her Pearl St atelier the House of Olympia and the period was inspired by the eighteen century with the rule of creating Art that Elevated the Spirit. Lumiere (2001-2020) was Colette’s response to 9/11.  Displacement and uncertainty were recurring themes, as well  as advocating for the need to become lighter and return to the essential in all aspects of life.

Now, amidst the pandemic and Colette’s ongoing storage tribulations, Colette de la Victoire has been conceived! A figure determined to triumph in a time of darkness, she once again finds herself in the midst of a new birth.

Dancers Mindy Upin, Tiana Fridley, Jenny Gram, Lane Halperin, and Brittany Sylwestrak with contributors Katherine Roarty and Klara Beyeler, create a balletic pallet in structure and appearance using embellished facial expressions and theatrical prose as a romantic technique to showcase a woman’s vulnerability and vulgarity at once.

768,803872799,"WHO WE ARE
We're a group of young film makers at Norwich University of the Arts with a passion for story telling. This will be our second drama made while studying film and moving image production.  
THE STORY
Farren, a compassionate young carer, maintains the domestic responsibilities within the household; tasks that Willow, his poorly mother cannot. Willow relies on Farren as her primary care giver, with him often returning home from school early. We meet Farren beginning to make preparations for his mother’s birthday; using the little money he has saved to get her a gift.
WHY WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT!
For Farren to build a world of flora to aid his mother's mental health, we want to use real flowers in abundance to really create a sense of freshness within the filming space. The flowers would be sourced locally from Norwich Market to support local producers and as a way of the team showing support for such a fine city! 
We need to turn an entire house into a place of domesticity with the evidence of medical equipment thats tells the story of why Farren is in his situation- caring for Willow, his mum that suffers with Transient Ischemic Attacks. 
We'd love Farren's story to reach other audiences further than our own personal distribution. We're looking to submit to festivals during the summer, in the hope that we get to share the production we make, but festivals aren't cheap- with each submission costing easily £50! "

When we moved into our current location at 1203 Camden we knew we had our work cut out for us. We were taking over a building that was never meant to be a theater and turned it into two. Yep. Our building was a lab! That's right! It has ugly white and green linoleum flooring. We want to put down a new floor and paint the plain white walls a nice warm tan color. We would also like to paint the outside and do a nice mural to let everyone know we ARE A THEATER!
Now it’s time to give our little corner of downtown another makeover.
We ask for your help to give our theater a few much-needed changes: replace the floors in the lobby and hallway, replace the ceiling tiles and light bulbs, get an external sign for the theater, and give the outside of our building paint job. Help us make our space more inviting and welcoming to our audiences!
With your generous donations we will be able to do all of this - and hopefully more!

  The Problem 
 How CHULA Will Help
Film Synopsis
Chula is a drama about a young African woman living with bipolar disorder in the Washington D.C. area, played by Ethiopian-American actress Selamawit Worku. The film touches upon her upbringing and subsequent rise to fame which is tainted by her mental illness and a strict father; One whose inability to distinguish between discipline and emotional abuse leaves scars that follow Chula into adulthood. To cope with the stress of her illness and rising fame, Chula begins to abuse drugs and alcohol. Chula's relationships, including her relationship with her boyfriend (played by Nigerian actor Obum Ezekwem) suffers, culminating in Chula losing all that she values most; yet in the end, a glimmer of hope is found.
The Producer's Inspiration for CHULA
Hello, my name is Ledet and I have served as a Psychiatric Nurse for over a decade in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area. After traveling to a number of African countries where I witnessed the burden of mental illness, I could no longer ignore the disparities that exist in both the African diaspora and the continent regarding mental illness. I decided that it was important to create something to address the ways that mental illness is stigmatized in our community and in doing so, empower those affected, provide awareness, and strive towards better solutions.  This manifested itself in the film, CHULA.
A patient at a mental health facility 60km outside of Addis is chained to a beam. This is often how patients are treated.
  Ledet reconnecting with two patients who have progressed over the last two years
We’re offering funders the opportunity to play a role in raising awareness of an issue affecting millions of Africans around the world. Mental illness still remains a taboo subject within minority communities. Many Africans, and members of the African diaspora, do not seek mental care due to the perceived stigma and when they do seek help, it is often too late.

Thank you for taking time to look at our Kickstarter page, it's a project we really believe in and hope you can join us in making it a reality.
TAME is a short film staring CAGGIE DUNLOP and LAURE STOCKLEY. The initial idea came from a frustration at the types of roles the two actresses were being offered and a desire to portray three dimensional rounded characters that suffer from the same faults and flaws as their male counterparts.
It's not that these roles don't exist entirely, it's just that there's less of them. 
Working with award winning director DAVID PETCH the two actresses started to explore themes of gender, sexuality and friendship. Through writing and acting workshops we developed the characters first and then built the story around them. 
An unusual approach to screenwriting but in this case it felt right, we want to make a film where people care about the characters, where they can relate and connect with them.
WHY KICKSTARTER?
We're opting to use Kickstarter as it provides filmmakers and actors the unique opportunity to be in control of the creative process. We want to make a film that doesn't conform to the usual gender stereotypes and we don't want to compromise our vision. 
We also want to battle preconceptions about what role an actor can or should play. One of our lead actresses Caggie is probably best know for appearing in the TV show Made in Chelsea. Although she's proud of her achievements in the show it shouldn't be something that defines her career. The kind of roles she's offered as an actress often reflect the stigma that reality television carries. TAME is a break from this. 
WHERE YOUR MONEY GOES.
Although none of our 'above the line talent' such as our actors or director are taking a fee we do need still need a budget. We have to pay for our crew, locations and equipment and we need to feed people on set. 
We'll be working with top of the range equipment such as the Arri Alexa camera, prime lenses and editing on an AVID. You may know what all of this is or it might sound like a foreign language. All it means is that we'll have the ability to make an incredible looking film. Although the best equipment in the world means nothing without having the right people to use it.
Luckily we're working with some of the top Heads of Department in the industry. Our Director of Photography, Production Designer, Editor are all working for a fraction of their usual rates but we do still need to cover some of their expenses.
We want to be 100% transparent with you, our investors so that's why we're also sending a simplified copy of our line budget to everyone who invests. We want you to see exactly where your money's going and also thought it might be of interest to any aspiring filmmakers out there.

773,1933205948,"Glad you asked. Chippo is our very own invention: a patent pending, mind-blowing mash-up of golf and traditional backyard games. We like to call Chippo the glorious lovechild of golf and cornhole (the popular bean bag toss game). We’ve combined the old fashioned, beer-slugging, tailgate-dominating, sunshine-basking goodness of games like cornhole with the gentlemanly, giddiness-inducing, side-betting beauty of golf. Chippo is the only backyard game where you can work over your buddies, while working on your short game. Sound good? Well, we are ready to bring Chippo to beaches, backyards, tailgates, gym classes and golf clubhouses all over these great United States of America...but we need your help!
    We’ve done a lot so far to get Chippo to this point. We've started a company; done a bunch of research; built and tested countless prototypes; obtained legal protection by filing for patents and trademarks; chosen a trusted manufacturing partner; perfected our prototypes; finalized the awesome design of Chippo; found a trusted, efficient and experienced storage/order fulfillment/shipping partner; and built an in-depth business plan and financial model...to name a few things. Now, we need your help in order to fund our first large order from the manufacturer. Kickstarter offers an amazing platform to connect Chippo with other like-minded and passionate golf enthusiasts and backyard game gurus. By backing Chippo, you’ll be supporting young inventors/entrepreneurs and joining the growing herd of Chippopotamuses...But also: Can you imagine being the first one of your friends to roll up to the beach, backyard, tailgate or clubhouse with Chippo? That’s the stuff legends are made of.
    Each Chippo set includes two target boards.
Each board measures 40"" x 24"" x 1.4"" and weighs just under 10 lbs.
Quality artificial turf covers the surface of each board, mimicking the feel of a real green and making for some sick spins and bounces.
Each board includes three strategically placed holes for scoring.
Netting is attached to each hole to catch scoring shots, leaving no confusion over the tally and preventing fist fights.
The legs fold under for easy storage and transportation.
There is a compartment to store the mats built into the underside of each board. 
Each Chippo set includes two chipping mats.
Our mats are made of quality artificial turf attached to heavy rubber so it doesn't move when you hit the ball.
The mats also enable you to play Chippo on any surface.
Here, we name a few surfaces on which one can play Chippo: sand at the beach, grass in a backyard or park, asphalt in a parking lot or driveway, the patio at the clubhouse, carpet at the office, tile in your bathroom, cheese or barbecue spare ribs (not sure which one is true) on the surface of the moon.
Each Chippo set includes six balls.
The balls are made of high quality, high density foam.
They travel 1/3 the distance of a regular golf ball but feel very similar off the club.
These balls are dense and balanced for true spin, trajectory and accuracy...
And soft enough that they will not dent car doors, break windows or noses, and won't bounce and roll like crazy. 
Safe to play with anyone, anywhere.
Like all great and beautiful things, playing Chippo is pretty simple: 

Step One: Set up the boards as depicted above.
Step Two: Find three friends (or highly skilled pets) and start chipping! 

Chippo is easy enough for non-golfers, and pros can move the boards back for a more challenging game. 
Gameplay is reminiscent of cornhole, washers or horseshoes, but with some cool new twists. Flip a coin to start, winners go first from there on out. You take three shots in a row at the target board and tally your total score like-a-this:

1 point: Just hit the board on a fly.
3 points: Drain your shot in the larger center hole. 
5 points: Send the ball to its home in either top corner hole. 
2x points: If you're a surgeon with a sixty degree wedge, bounce your shot off the chipping mat for double (2, 6 or 10) points. Promptly yell ""Mashed Potatoes!"" 

Your opponent standing next to you goes next. The player with the highest total score wins that “hole” for his/her team. The players on the other side then battle it out for ""hole"" #2, and so on. Play an 18 “hole” match. Settle ties with a sudden death playoff - intense! You can drink beer, heckle your friends and gamble while doing this. Life is good. Keep in mind, these are the standard Chippo Match Play Rules but, like golf, there are many different ways to keep score while playing Chippo such as Stroke Play and Nassau. We’ll have a full list with all the different scoring options soon.
  History books are strewn with great and prescient inventors. Men who were able to see into the future, beyond the boundaries of their own time and place, toward a version of the world that was better, more perfect, more beautiful. Men like Edison, Franklin, Tesla, Jobs. Brendan and Matt, the co-founders of Chippo Golf LLC, have one thing in common with these men: Brendan and Matt are also men. Other than that, they likely have very little in common with those other men. Brendan and Matt are somewhat intelligent, mediocre looking, washed up athletes, who happened to have a great idea (Chippo - a game that combines golf and cornhole - why doesn’t this already exist!?) and decided to man-up and make it happen! They are both avid golfers, intensely competitive backyard gamers, and both incredibly bad at both golf and backyard games. Brendan is a former collegiate athlete, with an MBA, two kids, a heart of gold, a receding hairline and ten years of experience in finance. Matt is a little older with slightly more hair (though an awkward percentage of it is gray given his age), two dogs with a total of seven legs, one kid on the way and over ten years of experience in marketing and design...and he can still do a kick-flip on his skateboard - whatever that means. Chippo is their first entrepreneurial venture together. They'd love it if you'd consider joining them on their mission to bring golf and backyard game infused fun to the world.
As if this baby hippo learning to swim isn't rewarding enough...

We'll be brewing with a 1 BBL system which we're in the process of purchasing. Our next step is is to sign the lease and order the remaining equipment so we can apply for our Federal, State and Town licensing. We were lucky enough to find a great location within 1.6 miles of our home and think you'll love it there as much as we do. 
The preliminary floor plans
 Below is a list of the handful of things we need to purchase and renovations we'll need to do on the warehouse. Right now our project is self-funded, so with your help, we hope to get the renovation under way.

775,1603798132,"I have always written. After my daughter was killed by a drunk driver in 2007, I started to panic that when I died, her entire life, which I carried in my memories, would be gone. She would be forgotten. In a panic to record every single one I could, I started to write obsessively. This also gave my mind something to focus on during those first horribly painful months. My writing changed from one of recording the past to surviving the present. I wrote poems to release the grief, I penned letters to my dead daughter. I spilled my emotions and thoughts onto the page, trying to find the answers in between the words. Attempting to make the unimaginable make sense. I ranted and raged. Slowly the sentences stopped carrying the weight of my anger and started to make way for the healing.  Along the way, I have learned more about myself, my daughter, and about the truth in others than I had imagined. The journey is cyclical, and I pass a stage in my grief, and thinking I have overcome it, and there it is again. Waiting on the horizon, for me to meet it again. I don't have all the answers. This book is very personal to me. Selfishly, it is a way to get my daughter's name into as many heads as I can. She isn't flesh and blood and laughter anymore. She is made of bits of dreams, memories, photos, and she lives when someone thinks of or says her name. I have shared my writing in very limited ways, to a few people, and I have been told I should publish, because my words resonate with those who have lost a child. I don't have a degree, I am not a trained writer. My words are merely those of a mother who has had to say good bye to a precious child."

first look... NEW logo!
 With your help we will be able to complete our current product development phase and get our product out by early next year.
YOUR MONEY will go towards:
1) Brewing and tasting equipment, including 10 large glass bubblers, a heated production case (we're building it in the photo just below), two kegs, a CO2 system, a custom water filtration system, and various growlers, bottles and labels.
2) Ingredients and supplies, including organic black tea, green tea and yerba mate, organic evaporated cane juice and turbinado, raspberries, ginger, hops, wood chips, and other herbs and spices.
3) Some remaining licensing fees and business certifications, including the $800 CA LLC tax and additional training and certifications for the team.
4) The gorgeous logo of the meditating, levitating rabbit and all those killer rewards we're offering!
5) Tastings and focus group events that we will be hosting later this year. Please stay tuned for more and then come participate!  Your feedback and participation will make us great.
---  
What We've Accomplished So Far:  We've already set-up the basics, like the LLC, the website, the business model and the plan.  We've also created a slew of promising prototypes and have identified our basic process.  We've also confirmed that there is a huge (untapped) demand for this product.  Now we are focusing on a much larger product development and testing phase.
Action Plan:  By later this year, we plan to have 12 strategic variations on our first core formula, about 72 gallons total.  These variations will be tasted and evaluated at a series of tastings and focus groups.  With your help, along with the help of our most discerning and market-savvy friends, we will dial in on the optimal formula for our first release.  Concurrently, we will continue to develop our business model and plan, enter competitions, and attract additional capital.  We'll make the jump to commercial production by early next year and get our life-changing product to market by spring.
Commitments:  Our long-term plans include a carbon-negative production and distribution set-up, (solar panels, energy-savvy systems, water conservation, and lots of plant life), a gorgeous light-filled taproom and outdoor area, and a strong social and animal friendly role in the community.  Expansion beyond the Bay Area will depend on a locally-owned, entrepreneurial business model, creating fun, rewarding lifestyles for go-getters in places like Austin, LA and Seattle.  And we will continually advance the craft of probiotic alcohol.
PLEASE CONTRIBUTE!
YOUR PARTICIPATION in our fundraisers and focus groups will make us that much stronger.
YOUR SHARING of this campaign (and what we're up to in general) will open new doors!  So please share with abandon!  That's how the magic really happens.  :-)

INSIDE VIEW:  One of our core commitments is to promote and foster responsible water.  After all, we are in California, and our product is almost all water!  On the most basic level, that means filtering our municipal water supply efficiently and effectively.  That's the most responsible practice we know of!
Our first step in that direction was to create a customized water filtration system.  It's specifically designed to remove exactly what we need it to remove, with no water wasted.  Won't you love knowing that the water in your kombucha beer is brilliant?  You bet!
Here is our first humble system, and here's to the difference we'll make in the long run.  Your support here is support for great water!

780,776630875,"    Ich bin zurzeit sehr glücklich über die vielversprechende und positive Entwicklung der Kunst, und zwar die Rückkehr zum Realismus. Jahr für Jahr gewinnt diese Kunstrichtung wieder mehr Begeisterte, auch auf den Leinwänden der berühmten Künstler unserer Zeit sieht man zunehmend realistische Darstellungen. Vor allem die Künstler der Europa und der USA arbeiten im realistischen Stil. Ich finde es sehr faszinierend und auch überraschend, da die Tendenz des letzten Jahrhunderts immer weiter in die abstrakte Kunst abdriftete und der Realismus immer an Bedeutung verlor. Aber auch das ist der Grund für die Rückkehr des Realismus in die Galerien und Ateliers, die Übersättigung des Marktes mit Abstraktion. Jetzt ist der Realismus modern und innovativ, auch die Kunstsammler der ganzen Welt greifen immer häufiger zu den im realistischen Stil gemalten Kunstwerken. Trotz der hartnäckigen Kritik mancher Kunstkritiker: die Kunst entwickelt sich nach eigenen, der Gesellschaft unbekannten Regeln, nimmt den eigenen Lauf und lässt wieder auferstehen oder in der Bedeutungslosigkeit versinken, ohne, dass die Kritiker oder Kenner einen Einfluss darauf nehmen können. Die Kunst wird nur durch die Künstler erschaffen, nur sie entscheiden, was aktuell, modern und angesagt ist. Man kann die Kunst in keine Rahmen zwingen, und die Künstler allein entscheiden, ob sie einen Pinsel schwingen oder eine Performance erstellen, ob Abstrakte Kunst oder Realismus – die Künstler entscheiden, was gesehen werden muss. Und jede Richtung hat ihre Daseinsberechtigung, in der Vergangenheit und der modernen Gesellschaft.
 Das Projekt wird mir die Chance geben, die Bildreihe zum Thema der Tiere und der Mythologie  zum malen. Den Vorgang meiner Arbeit möchte ich mit eine Camera aufnehmen so sollen spannende Videos entstehen. Anschließend  werde ich eine Ausstellung organisieren.

Our mission particularly rings true in our brand new piece WannaBe, to be revealed this May!
The Season
DAMAGEDANCE Spring Season
World premiere of WannaBe
May 3-4, 2014
Manhattan Movement and Arts Center
248 West 60th Street, NYC
The Inspiration
WannaBe plays upon masculinity versus femininity, and exposes expectations of gender identity. This solo is designed to be performed by a female or a male dancer, interchangeably. Inspiration is drawn from MGM films of 1940s and 1950s such as Singin' in the Rain and Easter Parade. The way a viewer connects with the lead characters, regardless of the viewer's gender, sparks the interest of Taylor. Especially during this period in time, gender roles were prominently portrayed in films like these. Personally, Taylor feels a stronger self-identity within the male characters played by Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly, as opposed to the leading ladies. Even when watching these movies as a child, she felt conflicted that she identified with the male figures way of moving, which was not expected of her gender.
The Goal
DAMAGEDANCE's new piece strives to deliver honest, dynamic, and genuinely thought-provoking art.  Not only is the company working with the dancers to build WannaBe--we are collaborating with our DD family to produce the most unique product possible. WannaBe will be presenting new choreography, new music, and new costumes!

I noticed unlike all the appointment and medications photography and going in to a zone that felt right was actually helping. Then I just thought to my self ""I wonder if my photos would be good enough to catch people's attention I called up a local little art store to talk about carrying a bit of the photos I took I ended up actually selling a lot of my shots on canvas and just small prints it was a nice feeling that people were taking a liking to my stuff. Then one day in 2014 I left my gear in a friends car well we ran in to a restaurant to grab some food and when we returned to the car the window was smashed and every thing was gone. Iv since been unable to replace it because I am currently attending trios college for game design and technology's all the money that was saved up to replace the gear had to go in to tuition cost so it's still on the back burner till I am able to save up again which is why I am here today asking for help so I can get back out there and hopefully start shooting again to help cope with things and see if there are still people out there that would take a liking to my shots with a web site that I will be creating along with a few social media accounts when I get started again to help spread my work across and get noticed around the world instead of just locally

We are El Paso's Longest Running Community Theatre going on 51 years.  The building that we are in has been ours since 1964.  The building itself is 14 years older than that and has seen only a handful of major makeovers. 
 This was the first major one. It has since seen a few minor ones such as a roof resealing a few back, emergency exits added in, and many superficial changes such as paint jobs.
All things tend to wear out over tie, especially things that see a lot of use.  Our lights are used constantly, day in and day out. We are still using stage lights from the 1960s. Little by little, they have been giving out so that as of now, our working lights are less than half the stage lights that we actually have.  We not only need new lights, but new wiring as well.  This is going to require a HUGE undertaking.  We need to bring in a professional electrician and basically gut everything out.  
As a non-profit organization, what we make in ticket sales goes towards the show royalties, our utilities,insurance,  costumes, sets, programs, and regular maintenance items such as cleaning supplies, office supplies, lightbulbs, etc.  Being able to set aside a little money at a time to replace the lights hasn't been possible because community theatre in El Paso has its times of growth and its times of struggle, but nothing consistent.
We would sincerely like to continue providing entertainment to the El Paso/Las Cruces (and beyond!) area for many more years to come, but without lights, it is hard to continue on.
We would also like to come into the 21st century and replace our old, dying lights with the newer, more energy-efficient LED lights.  Not only does this save the theatre money on electricity costs, but the lights are much cooler onstage so that our actors don't melt!
We have been working hard at renovating the lobby, concessions area, and outside.  As you can see, we've been doing quite well with our brick campaign to help beautify our outside area.  Not only do the bricks keep the area weed free and make it look nice and clean, our patrons will have a permanent spot in our theatre history!"

The bold designs of Axis Mundi Games and the neoclassical virtuosity of CA Sculpts have merged to bring forth a boutique product designed for the most demanding collectors.
Death Goddess Izanami is a model that focuses on emotions as no model in the industry has done before. The sad majesty and woeful glory of a tormented goddess, the divine terror and eternal anguish of the departed, mere phantasms of their former conscience... all brought to life by a sculpture devised to match the style and the strength of neoclassical statues as never dared before.
As a surprise for the campaign launch, Progenitor God Izanagi has arrived! Izanami's husband and brother has manifested in all his mighty, progenitor of the new generation of gods and ordainer of the universe.

The models are designed to be incredibly detailed and we are pushing our efforts to bring every detail to the highest point of clarity that is humanly possible!
Death Goddess Izanami has been 3D printed by one of the best artisans in the EU in high quality resin to ensure it can be cast smoothly and in great detail.
*Mana photo depicts a 1:10 example to show what can be done with the STL file. The resin model you can gain as reward for backing is in 54mm scale.

Death Goddess Izanami is part of the Sankokushin: Five Sacrifices project, the upcoming board game developed by Axis Mundi Games. Death Goddess Izanami campaign inaugurates the Sankokushin resin line, named Fukashi Sekai 不可視世界 (Invisible World), that we intend to develop for years to come with more and more models.
Sankokushin: Five Sacrifices is a solo-cooperative campaign game set in a fictional version of medieval Japan planned for Kickstarter in 2021.

Over the last few years I've collected some together, running a Kickstarter just over a year ago that created a book of Yorkshire tales. This delivered ahead of schedule and is now available to buy
""Yorkshire"" book
Since then, I've collected some more Yorkshire tales, managed to source a rare copy of Ammon Wrigley's book of Folklore / tales from Saddleworth (which I transcribed and shared), and did a mini-kickstarter recently for a language update of some Lincolnshire ""Legends of the Carrs"".
Saddleworth Book
This project is collecting together a group of Lancashire folk and fairy tales, similar to the Yorkshire collection I did previously. There are between 40 and 50 tales (I'm still working my way through some old newspapers as well as deciding exactly what to include), that will come out at a book roughly 200 pages long. My rough list so far is at the bottom of the page!
The target is set so it will cover most of the costs of production, campaign costs, printing, and distribution. If we make significantly more than the target, I could get a small contribution towards my time, but not at the target level! 
The main reward is the book of Lancashire tales (either PDF or paperback). The early bird rewards include a copy of ""Saddleworth Superstitions and Folk Customs"" as a bonus (transcribed and printed by me), and I've also included the option to get a copy of the Yorkshire folk tales book as well. The ""Library Gift"" reward level is two copies of the Lancashire book, which can either both sent to one address, or the second copy can be sent to a library of your choice (no additional P&P charged).
NEW: All the physical rewards now include a 48 page notebook, as an extra / bonus reward. They will have plain, high quality paper inside (I use a fountain pen and it writes beautifully on this paper) and either a dragon or giant on the front cover with a bit of folklore related text on the back, selected at random when I pack the rewards. The cover is a thick ""velvet touch"" laminated card.
notebooks
I've been deliberately pessimistic with the lead times, so I'm confident that we'll deliver early rather than late. I'm currently working on finishing off the book, so as soon as we hit the target we'll get started on the publication / printing process and be ready to go to print as soon as possible.

A recent comment from a satisfied customer:
""Mark, I am blown away!!!! I got your BR sampler yesterday and have played it non stop for 2 days in my media room inviting anyone that wants to listen to 5.1 soundtracks in 24/96. True THX reproduction.  Some of the tracks make me weak in the knees.  I was going to bring it to a local movie theater and play it and get some sales for you.  Is that OK? As you know people pass judgment on Audio when they have never listened to real DVDHD and Blueray 124/96 in full THX is is stunning and my jaw and tongue are still dirty from licking the floor.  Great Compilation of some of your best work  Very much appreciated.  You have been and always will be my reference standard until someones Tops your Skills.  The imaging in 5.1 is breath taking.  I will pass the word. Cheers and thanks for making me  realize what a Audiophile should be!!""

Welcome
A User Guide to Streaming, Downloads, and Personal Audio explains and explores three of the most important recent trends in high-end audio: streaming, high-resolution downloads, and personal audio — and additional related topics! The distribution and consumption of recorded music was forever transformed when it broke free of physical media in the 1990s. While many in the audiophile community still cherish their turntables, vinyl LPs, optical disc players, CD/DVD/BD discs, and even reel-to-reel tapes and decks, the digitization of music delivers greater fidelity, new modes of listening, portability, and the opportunity to listen to any song, anywhere, at any time, at the highest quality levels! Music's new normal is a major shift from traditional listening and requires a reexamination of equipment, content, and quality. This book breaks it all down for you with easy to understand, non-technical, explanations, example systems, and plenty of illustrations. 
My name is Mark Waldrep. I suspect some of you are already familiar with my work through my record company, the award-winning AIX Records, high-resolution music catalog, my over 1200 articles at RealHD-Audio.com, writing at Audiophile Review, or my previous book, which was successfully funded on Kickstarter in 2016. Music and Audio: A User Guide To Better Sound, is 880-pages long, comes with a demonstration Blu-ray disc (or file downloads), and has been recognized as the ""gold standard"" reference book on high-end audio. If you missed out on the first KS campaign, you can get both of my books as part of this campaign. The Absolute Sound's Andrew Quintet wrote, ""Mark Waldrep Knows What He's Doing!"" 
In the new book, I'll compare and contrast some of the most popular streaming music services — Tidal, Spotify, Qobuz, Deezer, Pandora, Amazon Music HD, Apple Music, and even the Neil Young Archive — and determine whether they deliver real high-resolution streaming or not! Many audiophiles prefer to ""own"" their music but purchasing and playing high-resolution music downloads is very different than picking a CD or vinyl LP off the shelf and playing it. What are the facts behind digital music downloads, are all files the same, and does recording provenance play a significant role in delivering fidelity? What role does ""hi-res"" audio play in the fidelity of streaming or downloaded music? 
High-resolution digital downloads began with iTrax.com back in the fall of 2007. Other services quickly followed. HDtracks, Onkyo Music, SuperHiRez.com, HiResAudio.com, and others make available a wide catalog of albums at 192 kHz/24-bit — and ever higher! Does it matter? Is it worth spending $24.95 on a high-resolution digital transfer of an analog album from 1971?
During a sabbatical I was granted in the fall of 2019, I designed and initiated the HD-Audio Challenge II. The goal of the survey was to determine whether audiophiles could reliably pick a native high-resolution audio recording over a Red Book or compact disc downconversion. Almost 500 people responded and my research was accepted by the Audio Engineering Society (AES) for presentation at their 2020 Fall Convention.
The availability of high quality files and streaming audio has brought networked audio to the audiophile world. The book will explore the necessary hardware and software components required to set up a NAS and make suggestions regarding the best players to use with your digital music collection. We'll discuss the advantages and disadvantages of Roon, Amarra, Audirvana, and other playback platforms.
Finally, we'll examine the world of personal music delivery from in ear monitors to high end headphones and immersive sound bars to surround automotive systems. The reproduction of high-fidelity audio is no longer the exclusive domain of well heeled audiophiles, limited to in home dedicated system setups, or bound to physical formats and large devices. Music has been set free! 
A User Guide to Streaming, Downloads, and Personal Audio will educate, clarify, and demonstrate how you can enhance your listening experience…simply and without spending a whole lot of money. The focus is on getting accurate information and achieving dramatic improvements in fidelity.
A User Guide to Streaming, Downloads, and Personal Audio brings these new and very important aspects of the audiophile hobby into focus. Like many of you, I've been embraced the transition from physical media to the the brave new digital age with all of its complexity and variations. The new book explores topics that I’ve learned and contributed to over the past decade. I'm not professional reviewer or journalist for major trade magazines or websites although I am asked to contribute to these outlets regularly. I write about what I know and what I want to know more about — and that you want to know about as well.

I have been a musician/composer, professional audio engineer, record producer, and university professor for over 40 years. My career spanned the analog era when 2"" - 16 or 24 track multichannel decks were standard to the sophisticated digital systems used for production and reproduction today. The constant drive for higher fidelity and more efficient ways to distribute music have transformed the methods of producing AND releasing music to the public. There are innovative new technologies that can deliver immersive, HiFi sound to headphones and sound bars.
Mark Waldrep at Abbey Road Studios - the studio where the Beatles recorded!
Music and audio have dominated my life ever since I was a teenager. When Beatlemania swept across the country, I was one of thousands that took up the guitar, joined a band to seek fame and fortune as a rock star. But my future didn’t put me in front of a microphone. I found my place on the other side of the studio glass…I turned my love and knowledge of music and audio recording into a successful career as a recording engineer and music producer.
I studied architecture at the University of Michigan before dropping out and heading west to California. I followed my heart to see if music and audio could support me. Thankfully, with a lot of hard work and a fair amount of luck, they have.
More than 40 years later, I now own a state-of-the-art, multi-room recording and post production facility in Los Angeles, operate a high-end audiophile label AIX Records, a hi-res music download site iTrax, and have written a blog at RealHD-Audio since April 2013. I finished my academic education at UCLA in 1986 with a Ph.D. in Music Composition but also graduated with degrees in Computer Science and Art.
My production company AIX Media Group was responsible for the first DVD-Video titles released in the United States back in March of 1997 and the first DVD-Audio title three years later. In the subsequent few years, AIX grew to over 50 employees churning out DVDs for the likes of New Line Cinema, CBS, Morgan Creek, and a whole bunch of record companies. We did projects for The Rolling Stones, Britney Spears, The Backstreet Boys, Kiss, Tool, The Allman Brothers, and hundreds of others.
With the introduction of the DVD-Audio format in 2000, I started recording and releasing new high-resolution recordings. Twenty years later, the AIX Records catalog is one of the largest collections of native high-resolution music … albums that were actually recorded using high-res equipment. I’ve been encouraged by the awards, positive reviews, and continued sales of our catalog of DVD-Audio/Video discs, Blu-rays, and high-res music downloads. Andrew Quint, one of the senior editors of The Absolute Sound Magazine, commented in a feature article, “…the multi-channel audio, emanating from five B&W 801 loudspeakers, is quite simply the most realistic and involving instance of recorded sound I can recall, from any source format"".
The new book is still in the writing phase so no reviews are currently available. However, the response to my first book, also crowdsourced on Kickstarter, was universally positive. Here is just some of the feedback I received:
""This is a staggeringly extensive but balanced and insightful work of outstanding merit. I would not say it will become a standard in its field but THE GOLD STANDARD.""
Gary Reber - Publisher/Editor
""This is the first book that I've come across that lays out so much technical and practical audio knowledge in such an approachable manner. Positively outstanding!""
Carlo La Rosa - Senior Editor | Secrets of Home Theater and High Fidelity
""If you only purchase one reference book on high-end audio, Music and Audio: A User Guide To Better Sound is the clear winner!""
Jerry Del Colliano - Home Theater Review
""You've created what I now consider the 'Bible' of high-end audio.""
Gene DellaSala - Audioholics
I started a daily blog in April of 2013 at RealHD-Audio.com. What began with less a few dozen readers has blossomed into one most read sites focusing on high-resolution audio and music. The site has technical information, interviews, equipment reviews, high-res music analyses, commentary, profiles on high profile equipment designers, guest editorials, and show reports. Today, the site reaches over 5000 readers everyday. Individuals from around the globe write to express their support and describe the site in glowing terms.

""Absolutely the best article I’ve read; what ever happened to the saying  'Pay Peanuts, Get Monkeys'. I’ve just turned 60 and my thoughts were that ALL of my knowledge over 30 years in providing mission critical communication systems in the industry would now count for something. Ha, providing I get it for free, it’s accepted. Your posts are a highlight on my mornings!! Thanks.""

""Thanks a lot for all your work. I love and recommend your book whenever I can. Bundled with the results of the HD Audio Challenge your book is by far the best resource out there to face the realities of audio reproduction and keep the mysticism away that so many audiophiles seem to have bought into. Best regards, Jens""
""Let me take the opportunity to comment briefly: I love your book! Really seems like the 'audio bible'. It’s a big book so of course I didn’t finish it yet - I am a hobbyist audiophile so I’m in no hurry. As an electrical engineer (edu in high voltage power, but working with motion control automation last +25 years) it always surprised me to see people obsessed with old analog tech like tape and LPs when the CD is clearly so much better (not to mention high-res PCM). However I thought to myself “are those cable people on to something?”. Sooo nice to see you bring common sense and science into the equation. Really also love your explanations and experience from the professional recording environment. I was mildly shocked to learn how little quality you are allowed to produce for the high volume labels."" Palle"

You may already know me from instagram, where I'm semi-famous for my dramatic Disney Karaoke insta-stories. 
I'm a graphic designer passionate about all things nerdy, feminist, and bookish.
This is my second Kickstarter campaign.  I successfully launched a range of Feminist-Nerd enamel pins earlier this year (see the project here).
This shirt will NOT be available anywhere else once this campaign is finished. This is your ONLY chance to get it!
The funds will go towards the production of the shirts, packaging + shipping, and associated fees. 
Remember that Kickstarter will not charge you until the campaign is finished and fully funded. 
When I unveiled this design paying homage to the leading ladies of the MCU, I was inundated with requests to turn it into a shirt!
Here's a close up look... (note: background will not be printed on the shirts)
From left to right, we have: Maria Hill, Black Widow, Scarlet Witch, Captain Marvel, Valkyrie, Peggy Carter, Shuri, Gamora, and Wasp.
I'm working with a local screenprinter + digital apparel printer to ensure you get the best quality shirt for the most economical price. I've road-tested these myself and can confirm they are comfortable, easy to care for, and the colours look fantastic.
ABOUT THE PRINTING
- They  use eco-friendly, biodegradable inks which adhere to strict industry standards. 
- They recommend washing inside-out with cold water and then air-drying on a coat hanger to ensure the print lasts the longest possible!
- On white garments the ink almost goes into the fabric and so the print feels very soft to touch.
ABOUT THE SHIRT
- 150 g/m2 (141 g/m2 in White) – 100% Cotton Preshrunk Jersey Knit
- Seamless double needle 1.27cm rib knit collar
- Side seam construction with stylish tapered fit
- Deluxe 30’s Softstyle yarn
- Double-needle sleeves and bottom hem
- Tapered neck and shoulders
SHIRT SIZING

It is very challenging to market art, and to try to sell a piece of your heart and soul to the world. Artists often feel forced to be a jack of all trades, while sometimes sacrificing our more personal artistic inspirations. I've learned throughout the years that the business side of the art world is a vital aspect, and unfortunately the creative side is another entirely. I've also learned, that I am not good at doing both simultaneously, which has led me to this idea of going public with a plea for help.
I believe this is a breakout year for me as an artist. I've been an art teacher for almost 20 years, and the inspiration I get from my students is astounding. I hope to inspire and make my students proud.
I've earned the opportunity to show at Spectrum Miami during Miami's art week. It's the push I needed to have the courage to put myself and my art work out there for the world to see... To broaden my horizons and do what I was put on this earth to do. 
I hope that by connecting with art collectors, gallery directors and art institutions and by finally being able to share my labor of love with the world, my art will have a greater purpose. If this endeavor is successful, it will provide the catapult for me to be able to support philanthropic art entities, such as ""Artists for a Cause"" and ""Women Supporting the Arts"" in the future. 
Although the opportunity is outstanding, as a teacher, funding it on my own is nearly impossible. Please join me and Team MGMoriginals in helping me reach my goals!

797,855343077,"We Built A Better Mouse Trap... Introducing The HumBug
After three years in the making we are proud to introduce the HumBug UltraSonic pest repeller device. Designed for greater coverage distance due to our high output xt-33 transducer. Designed to repel most household pests.
Just plug your HumBug into a wall outlet anywhere you have an insect problem in your house and watch the HumBug go to work!






Safe For Humans & Household Pets!
The Humbug operates at 32khz-55khz creating auditory stress in most pests driving them away. Humans don't hear above 20khz with the exception being children hearing as high as 30khz making the HumBug silent and harmless. Cats & dogs hear frequencies between 22khz-25khz making it safe for your household pets.
Here is a partial list of the pests that hear the frequencies of the HumBug:
Mosquitoes
Fleas
House Fly
Spiders
Cockroaches
Ants
Grasshoppers
Mice
Rats
Bats






Built To Work In Your Country
Talking with team of engineers we insisted that the Humbug was capable of working in almost every country.  All you have to do is back our project and based on the country we are shipping to we will make sure you have the correct plug type to work in your country. See Image below for available socket types. So where does the HumBug work? 
United States
Canada
Mexico
Japan
Europe
South America
Asia
Russia
United Kingdom
Ireland
Australia
New Zealand
China
Argentina & more



Easy To Install & Economical To Operate
Just plug it into any existing wall socket and watch it go to work. You can expect to see results in as little as 7 days. The cost to operate each unit is approximately 20 cents USD per month when using it 24 hours a day. The total electrical draw on each unit is less than 2 watts.

What People Actually Say About The Ultrasonic Pest Repeller
We relied heavily on feedback from actual users and made changes based on what they had to say. We are pleased to have reached a perfect 5 star rating from the actual users based on our final design.
 Philip - I've noticed a reduction in the amount of flies in my place.
 Eddy - I was told it would take a week to see any results but I saw the results start in only two days!
 Dale - No bug problems since I installed the repellers, very pleased.
 Amanda - I highly recommend this product. The squirrel living in my wall was gone in less than a week and has not been back.
 Grace - The mosquito problem is my house was out of hand. I installed one in each room and... problem solved. I told several of my friends to watch for your launch!
 Diana - I had one room in my house that seemed to have more ants than my backyard. I installed the ultrasonic repeller and a few days later I saw the ant population start to diminish. Happy to let you know that ten days after the install my ant problem is no more.
 Byron - Can't even hear the thing working, glad there is a light to let me know it is powered up. It has not bothered my cat or two dogs and the insects are gone.












 The HumBug Pest Repeller Is Built To Last
At the heart of the HumBug is our XT-33 extended range transducer which is designed to push our ultrasonic signal farther than the competition. Built of quality materials and components we are convinced that it's the best electronic pest repeller on the market. So convinced that we offer a 5 year no questions asked return policy. We are proud of our product and just as proud to stand behind it.






A Superior Product From A Simple Sketch
Three years ago we set out to design a great looking and superior performing pest repeller... and to think that the initial design was created on a restaurant napkin!
The initial design was changed and modified over the three years until we finalized the look and then set out to make the ultrasonic pest repeller... the HumBug was born!"
798,307176437,"A few years ago I visited an Art Gallery here in The Netherlands that to my great surprise had about 30 paintings of my late grandfather Louis Jacob Hartz on exhibition and for sale. 
Knowing that about 200 paintings were stolen by the Germans during the Second World War, I was truly very excited by this find. 
I want to use the money raised by this project to start buying the paintings, have them cleaned and restored. Also I would like to start a foundation in his name and start organizing small exhibitions.

When a transgender couple finds an abandoned baby their first instinct is to take the baby to the police station. Ridiculed and humiliated, they are turned away. The couple decides to raise the child as their own. For society to accept this family, one of the couple decides to live as a man.
This movie, based on true events, follows their lives and exposes the hypocrisies of society as well as the struggles and humiliations the family, and the child in particular, faces.
WHY THIS STORY?
Transgender people have been part of Indian culture for several centuries. However, they have been seen as an object of ridicule over the last several years now. Transgender people are ostracised from society, but they are expected to be productive. They are not provided an education, but expected to find jobs. When it comes to movies, they are always used in comedy, but never as the protagonist.

WHY KICKSTARTER?
The Director and the star of the film have tried several times to raise money to get this story made into a movie. Universally, on hearing the story, the producers are moved to tears but, they fear, commercially, due to prejudice of the viewing public, that this film will not be a box office success. This story needs to be told. The lives of transgender people, despite all that society imposes on them, can be rich, fulfilling and interesting. The only way to get mainstream attention to the lives of, and the difficulties faced by, transgender people is through film.

From the bestselling author of Storms of Malhadocomes a new historical novel delving into a captivating element of Galveston’s past: the world of prostitution.

Nobody comes to a brothel seeking a true story. But you will want to learn the truth about Aimée Bonnard, the best-paid woman in Galveston. Formerly known as Yvonne LaCroix, Aimée arrives on the Island in the summer of 1898. She’s looking for work in a high-end brothel, but she is also outrunning the consequences of a deadly night in New Orleans – a night in which a rival prostitute lost her life. Mistress of deception, Aimée charms and entices her way into an existence of extravagance and adventure in one of the most exclusive brothels of Galveston. But does the life of a high-end prostitute offer as much freedom as Aimée craves? 

Befriending artists, architects, merchants, and gamblers, as well as a modest but kind-hearted doctor, Aimée falls in love with Galveston Island and discovers aspects of her own personality that surprise her. As a talented courtesan, her glory days are only just beginning. But a different Aimée surfaces, one that wants things that could stand in the way of her professional success, including allowing herself to fall in love. Meanwhile the past is closing in on her and Aimée will have to choose between the protection of a despotic madam and the uncertainty of taking matters into her own hands.

This book idea was prompted by requests from readers: readers who love Galveston Island, readers who loved Storms of Malhado, readers who specifically asked me to write the story of a Galveston prostitute. I sat down with this project during the lockdown in April 2020, and the story practically wrote itself. The Glory Days of Aimée Bonnard wanted to come to life more than any other of my six previous novels. The story told itself, it cose its own path (Aimée surprised me by resisting some of the plans I'd made for her, and she will surprise you too!) and by pushing me to write and edit at a pace I've never before experienced, it put me into an unprecedented predicament: After publishing Storms of Malhado to rave reviews in March 2020, this strange year will be the year in which I publish two books!
Putting forth a quality product as an independently published author involves tons of work and also a serious financial committment. Having a book professionally edited is not cheap - and not something an author should scrimp on! Formatting and creating a professional cover come at their own cost. The biggest hurdle, however, in today's oversaturated book market is advertising. Even an exceptional book will get lost in a dark corner of the internet if an author doesn't have a successful advertising strategy and is not willing to commit the resources to bring the book to the attention of readers, reviewers, journalists, and bloggers who will spread the word! Yes, word of mouth ultimately prevails when readers love a book, but creating the initial buzz requires time, effort, and money. 
During the pandemic, aside from writing this story, I have spent countless hours learning how to properly market a book. Storms of Malhado is beloved by readers and has garnered more attention than any of my previous novels because I've put in more time and money than ever before in order to market it. I need your help to take this to the next level with The Glory Days of Aimée Bonnard. I've learned how to use Amazon keyword ads (but they're not cheap!). I've learned how to use Canva to create compelling visuals (again, not cheap but so worth it!). I've connected with book bloggers and influencers that appeal to my key audience and sent them copies of the book. I've learned that giving away 2,000 ebooks makes a big difference but that one can't do so without paying for advertising (and I've learned which advertisers do wonders with getting free books in front of well-suited readers). I've learned that reviews are fundamental, but that people are unwilling to write them, and that there are quality services (not free) that help find volunteer reviewers willing to review in exchange for a free book. I've learned so much more and am still learning. But for me to make The Gory Days of Aimée Bonnard a success I need your help!
You are both the fuel behind this project as well as part of the buzz I need to create around it. Seven is a lucky number and with the experience of my previous six books behind me I know that this time around I can apply everything I've learned and give this new book the release it deserves. 

I plan to publish the book on December 21st 2020. It will be available both as an ebook and as a paperback. 

Here is a breakdown of my budget to make this happen:
Professional editing: $1,176
Professional Formatting: $250
Professional Help with Cover Design: $150
Paperback copies given to book bloggers, influencers, journalists: $270 (these average to about $9 each including shipping)
Paperbacks sent to key readers: $90
An introduction chapter written by a beloved historian who wrote a best-selling book on prostitution in Galveston: $500 ($1 a word for 500 words)
Amazon ads for the first month: $100
Review Service (matches book with volunteer reviewers, one does not pay for reviews): $50
Goodreads Giveaway ($119) + 3 books: $146
Advertising for free ebook campaign: $300
Total Cost: $3032

The manuscript has already undergone the professional editing process. I am currently putting the final touches on it. Next step: professional formatting. This book is almost ready to go! 
In addition to helping make my dream come true and making my readers happy, the success of this book can help several small businesses on Galveston Island - businesses I like to partner with in selling paperback copies, businesses who benefit from yet another element that adds to the mystique of Galveston and its appeal to those who love to explore its history.

803,955938907,"Mari Meade Dance Collective/ MMDC is a NYC based contemporary dance company that creates vibrant communities on and off stage. 
From Mari:
We have been working on this new piece since the summer of 2018. The spring prior, I decided to focus on telling a story about the journey of two sisters following the death of their mother. We've been lucky enough to have the opportunity to explore this idea over the past year, particularly through summer rehearsals at City University of New York (CUNY) Dance Initiative (CDI) at York College and a residency at University of North Carolina School of the Arts (UNCSA). During that time we had ample rehearsal space to begin building experimental creatures the sisters may encounter along their journey - like a three headed spitting monster. (Yes, gross, but also pretty cool.) I also researched outside of the studio and spent the rest of the summer sketching potential inspiration, character development, and sets; reading epic journey (or Nostos) novels; and researching The Hero's Journey through the lens of Joesph Campbell and others. Art Director Marc Witmer has also been collaborating with me for months, creating initial sketches, attending inspiring exhibits in New York, and working to create a world fitting for the sister's journey. This piece, like much of our work, includes text and acting, as well as dance that is highly physical and rhythmic in nature. With the help of dramaturges and theatre experts Melissa Gawlowski, Ben Yannette, and Maia Alexander, MMDC is hoping to bring the script, physical theatre, and movement together in an unprecedented manner.
We are currently still in process. We are constantly writing and rewriting, creating and recreating, sketching and erasing. Through these layers of building, we hope to create an epic world- both earthly and supernatural, about love and loss, relationships both personal and professional - with exaggerated characters that elicit a physical reaction from our audience- a gasp, a laugh, or simply a lean forward in your seat. This piece is a reflection of our own paths through the medium we love (dance), in that magical place we call home (the theatre), with our NYC family (MMDC). We invite you to take the leap of faith from the audience chair, and become a participant by directly supporting MMDC and our newest work through your generous donation.
This work (yes, still currently untitled...if you donate the whole $3375 you get naming rights, how about that?) premieres as part of Triskelion Art's 2019 Spring Season. June 6th, 7th, and 8th. This will be our second evening length work, and our third season being presented by Triskelion Arts. 
A bit more about Mari Meade Dance Collective / MMDC:

804,756870088,"Hello, my name is Amy Manson and I have been a potter for 12 years. I have lived in Leesburg, Virginia for 9 years and have outgrown my home pottery studio. I am raising funds to move to shared retail/studio space where I will continue to make my ceramic works of art, sell my work, and instruct others in the love and art of clay.
Here's my story:
My passion is working with clay - a soft malleable substance - throwing, forming, and urging it into an object of both beauty and function. An object, which can be admired, touched, held, and used in daily life. This process and transformation of the soft clay into a hard and beautiful object meant to be seen, used, passed along, maybe even eventually broken and given back to the earth seems to mirror personal growth and transformation. I use mid-range fired stoneware and porcelain in my work and enjoy glaze colors and themes, which can be found in nature. I try to incorporate a combination of family, prayer, meditation, nature, and the creation of pottery into every single day of my life as part of my own personal growth and transformation. It gives me great insight and joy to create a one of a kind piece of artwork. I hope others enjoy viewing and utilizing the pottery as much as I enjoyed making it!
  I am an avid cook and have been experimenting the past few year with various forms of bake-ware, serving pieces, and other items that enhance the culinary experience. I have been making pieces to become part of your daily life as well as pieces that become part of your traditions and celebrations! I look forward to sharing my latest functional and decorative creations with you.   
I have been a studio potter for 12 years and display and sell my work in various galleries in South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. I have taught most recently at The Cooley Gallery in Leesburg  and create my work (and recipes) at my home studio in Leesburg, Virginia. To learn more about my work please visit my website:  Http://www.amymansonpottery.com
A little more about me: 
I sell my pottery to an established Loudoun county clientele and online throughout the Country. I regularly work on commission pottery pieces as well as wholesale orders. I have been teaching adult and children’s programming in Loudoun County for 9 years and previously in Charlotte, NC. I have worked to become a highly respected artist and instructor in the community. I have a large patronage and sell pottery in all sections of the county, from wineries and vineyards, to galleries, art shows, fairs and direct sales. Over the years I have also also built a loyal and amazingly talented following of students who have returned again and again, for continued instruction. I have been fortunate to have been featured in local newspapers and magazines, as well as regional and statewide publications. I am also a mom of two amazing daughters, a wife to a very patient fellow, and pack leader to a 12 year old golden retriever, and a 7 year old Husky/Shepard mix. 
Here's the plan:
I have outgrown my home studio and am moving to a shared studio space in central Leesburg. I will be making this space my personal studio, and teaching space.  I realized about a year ago, I simply cannot add more hours to my days, so I need to work smarter. I want to consolidate my business into one location! 
I have been a contract teacher for several community art schools in the area. I have cherished my time at these studios, but spend a lot of time on the road from one to another, back and forth to unload the kilns, etc. Again, in hopes of consolidating the different aspects of my business into one space, I am excited to pursue my own studio.
This studio will be a destination studio and teaching space. It will be a great place to find a one of a kind piece of pottery, Jewelry, and art in the gallery space. As a working art studio, visitors will be able to view art being made daily. Adult and children’s ceramics and art education will be a major emphasis. In addition, The Studio will be a destination on The Western Loudoun Artists Studio Tour and on the Loudoun Artisan Trail. The studio will provide small intimate classes, professional instruction, and kiln firing services. It will be a active community art environment that will encourage tourism, online sales, drop in traffic and custom order pick up. Classes and instruction will be provided on an ongoing weekly schedule, as well as 1-time events, and private summer instruction for children 
I am crowd funding through KickStarter as a ""Pre-sale"" of some of my top selling items. The Pre-sale will help with the start up costs of the studio: Shelving, Tables, Kiln installation, and new equipment.
Thank you for your time and interest, Please drop by to say hello and see the new digs if you are in the area!!"

806,787552413,"About 10 years ago, McKinsey and Company, through its Minneapolis office, began working closely with several prominent leaders to identify opportunities to positively impact economic growth.  It, through one of its directors, was instrumental in establishing The Itasca Project ""an employer-led civic alliance whose members are drawn together by an interest in new and better ways to address regional issues that impact economic competitiveness and quality of life in the Minneapolis-St. Paul region. Its 50-plus participants are primarily private-sector CEOs. The group also includes a number of public and nonprofit leaders, including the governor of Minnesota, the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul, the chair of the Metropolitan Council, the leaders of the University of Minnesota and MNSCU and leaders of major foundations.""  McKinsey and Company provided staff support to the Itasca Project, and the Itasca Project's previous executive director was on loan from McKinsey and Company.
At least two present Minnesota State Colleges and Universities (MNSCU) Trustees were affiliated with the Itasca Project prior to appointment to the MNSCU Board.  Secondary Education in Minnesota was clearly on The Itasca Project's radar:
""In 2011, the Itasca Project launched a task force to identify strategies for higher education in Minnesota to drive long-term, sustainable economic growth and prosperity. The work is being led by a team of 12 leaders from business, nonprofit, and higher education institutions. An advisory group of 40 business and community leaders provided input and guidance. With the help of this group, we completed a Higher Ed Strategy for Minnesota then launched three resulting initiatives: Workforce Alignment (ensuring we have the skilled workers we need to meet the future economic needs), Collaboration (developing collaborations within higher education to optimize system-wide assets and efficiency) and Research & Innovation (establish partnerships to foster and strengthen an ecosystem of research and innovation). Read: Higher Education Partnerships for Prosperity. ""
Much of the research was provided by McKinsey and Company.
Incidentally, in a 2010 presentation to the National Governor's Association, McKinsey provided a presentation which revealed that significant projects were underway to overhaul secondary education in several states, including Minnesota.  The problem?  Too many employers had positions which remained unfilled due to 'skills gaps'.  The cause?  The longstanding independence of higher education led too many people into a liberal arts education.  The solution?  Tying higher education funding to fulfilling industry needs and shifting funding away from the liberal arts into industrial skills.
Chancellor Rosenstone became MNSCU Chancellor in 2011 and immediately began the process of ""Charting the Future"".  This process utilized nearly all of the same McKinsey and Company research which was previously provided to The Itasca Project.  Unsurprisingly, the Charting the Future report and the Higher Education Partnerships for Prosperity documents are essentially interchangeable.  
The draft Charting the Future report was presented in 2013, precisely when South Central College, Mankato and Faribault MN was in the search process for a new president.  A national headhunting firm with significant McKinsey connections found Dr. Anette Parker, whose previous employment was with AMTEC, a consortium of American Automotive Manufactures and the Tennessee Community and Technical College System.  Nearly simultaneously with Dr. Parker's appointment as President of SCC, AMTEC was featured in a McKinsey publication as an example of closely aligning educational programs to the needs of industry.
Dr. Parker, upon appointment to the college, immediately removed nearly all of the prior administration and began to severely modify programs within SCC without consultation with faculty, staff, students, or the community.  Rather, she increased her budget significantly, insulated administration from faculty, removed administration who objected to the treatment of faculty, and actively intimidated, bullied, and harassed students and faculty who questioned the direction of the school and the spending habits of the administration.  'The train is leaving the station.  Get on or get left behind', she said.  The problem is, no one knows where this train is headed.
McKinsey and Company was paid $2,000,000.00 to assist in the 'implementation' of Charting the Future.  Documents received thus far strongly support the suggestion that Charting the Future is being implemented on a small scale at South Central College prior to it being spread system-wide.
We are here seeking answers.  What will MNSCU look like when Charting the Future is implemented?  These documents exist.  
We are obtaining documents pursuant to a freedom of information request, and will be reviewing these documents to determine what the justification is for the significant systemic modifications that are being imposed seemingly without how this implementation impairs students' college experience and opportunity.  We will be presenting these documents to the public for review, and will be collecting the stories of what this implementation means. We hope to provide a series of stories and supporting documentation which will enhance public discourse about the future of education in Minnesota, and ultimately, the U.S. as a whole. 
It is time for an open, honest dialogue, based upon truth, and not imposed from outsiders who seemingly know better than we ourselves what our communities need from a college that provides an 'extraordinary education'.  Please join us."

I remember the day of my last exam when I finished my journalism masters course in Italy with a dissertation on Japanese “hikikomori"". After passing my exam, an examiner told me: ""I suggest you don’t focus too much on Japan, it’s not a country we’ll hear about that much in the near future”. That day was March 3, 2011. A week later, on Friday 11 March 2011, the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami destroyed the north-eastern coasts of Japan, subsequently causing the meltdown of three nuclear reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. Japan needed to be reported on more than before and since then I have continued/I have never stopped reporting from the area.
Otsuchi, Japan
And today?
THE PROJECT
In 2016, Japan will commemorate the 5th anniversary of the 3.11 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. Damage to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Fukushima caused a nuclear crisis that Japan is still struggling with. After an initial rush to clean and rebuild the most affected areas, the process slowed down last year when many problems emerged. Among them was disinformation about the nuclear risk and its consequences, by both the government and local media, as well as the significant number of refugees still living in temporary shelters, mostly consisting of shipping containers.
Traveling from Tokyo to the northeastern part of Japan the project will focus on the coastal life 5 years after the quake, on the rebuilding process and on the measures taken to prevent further tsunamis. Also, it will cover the issue of radioactive waste management and reprocessing. The project aim at observing the challenges and difficulties that local communities are facing while trying to live with the fear of radioactivity in those affected territories. The goal is to analyze the reconstruction process of villages obliterated by the tsunami, comparing the current situation with the Japanese government's initial promises of a return to normality.

808,1552588436,"What is Cue?
Cue is a collaborative dance project, which will premiere as an evening length performance this May. Working with musician Ryan Hommel, Claire Maurey, the founder of The Movery, and fellow dancers have choreographed an arrangement of movement compositions, which along with improvisation create Cue. The dancers will perform on their own individual stages, measuring four by four feet.The choreographed movement is broken into sections, each with a unifying feeling and theme. In between these sections the dancers will improvise movement exploring the comforts of home. The sections thus become a task, similar to everyday tasks like work, which take us away from our home. 
The project will be performed in three different locations around the Pioneer Valley, in Massachusetts. The first performance will be at our resident theater at East Street Dance Center, in Hadley, on May 8th at 8:00 PM. Our second performance is at the Sun Studio, in Florence, on May 9th at 8:00 PM and lastly, on May 17th the show will be performed outside in Northampton at 5:00 PM.
Why fund this project?
As a choreographer I am thrilled to be working collaboratively with a number of different artist. All of the artists I am working with have donated their time, craft and creativity to the project. In order to sustain our work as artists and collaborators we have to find ways to make and raise money.
In order to fulfill our vision for the piece we would also like to raise money for costumes, lighting, curtains, flowers, a photographer, chairs, theater space and future shows!
Who collaborated in creating Cue?
Claire Maurey is the choreographer and founder of The Movery. Claire is a Mainer who loves to move and be outdoors. She trained at the National Ballet School, in Toronto, and then went on to dance with the National Ballet of Canada and the Leipzig Ballet. Leaving the profession, Claire decided to pursue life beyond ballet. Through farming and baking she's found her way back to dance. Having found a home in the Pioneer Valley Claire has found her passion for dance revived. She now teaches ballet and contemporary dance at East Street Ballet. 
Ryan Hommel is a musical staple in the Pioneer Valley. Whether it’s playing with jazz/fusion heavyweights like Alan Evans (Soulive) and Beau Sasser (Alan Evans Trio) at Bishop’s Lounge, or at The Iron Horse or The Parlor Room with world-class singer/songwriters and bands such as The Sweetback Sisters, Heather Maloney, Seth Glier and Stephen Kellogg; Ryan continues to create with some of the greatest success stories to come out of the Western Mass music scene.

809,766152737,"A modular speaker, with a party mood, synchronized lights, and several addons, for every time of the day!
One speaker several configurations! change your light with an easy plug and play with USB addons.
Bluetooth speakers and disco balls are generally used to create a party mood. However, the music and lights are always out of sync, the disco ball simply emits the same light patterns around the room. Of course, there is an option of creating a light show using DMX-controlled lighting, but such a system is costly, fixed to a room, and overly complex.
To enjoy a party at home, some people resorted to using Bluetooth speakers and then manually moving the disco balls to enhance the mood.

We wanted to solve this problem by combining existing technology to create a speaker built to get the party started.


AI Robotic Arm 
The robot arm interprets audio input in real-time to generate movements based on rhythm and beat. This creates dynamic movements of the disco ball.

Mic Sense
The MicSense disco light increases variations and randomizations of the light pattern, further enhancing the mood as the disco ball moves

Portable
Partier is portable, so you can bring your party anywhere you want. Audio input is easy with any Bluetooth-enabled smartphone, so you can listen to your favorite tunes wherever you are.

USB Head
The standard disco ball attaches to the robot arm via a USB port. The port can also power modular add-on. This opens up countless possibilities for users to customize their speakers with other USB modules.


Partier interprets Bluetooth audio input from on the fly to move the robot arm to the rhythm and beat of the music that the speaker plays. The speaker analyzes the audio input and uses a special algorithm to move its robot arm.
The arm has a movement range of 270° vertically and 360° horizontally. As the arm dances to the music, the light from the disco ball dances in the surroundings to create dynamic lighting and mood.
The disco ball uses MicSense technology with a built-in microphone that detects surrounding sounds and changes its light pattern based on sound input. This gives the lighting effect of the dancing speaker an additional dimension, making it more dynamic and further enhancing the mood.
This effect is particularly pronounced when listening to slower music. A standard disco ball would generate light that blinks to a repetitive pattern, thus causing the light to feel disjointed when the beat slows down. The use of the MicSense disco light makes slow music more enjoyable.

The dancing speaker is portable. It has a battery life of 10 hours on a full charge and speaker mode, more than enough juice to keep the party going. The speaker uses Bluetooth 4.2 connectivity, allowing it to have high audio quality and play audio from it over a longer distance. Move around the party while playing music from your phone in your pocket!
The robot arm takes on modular accessories via a USB port. The default accessory is the disco ball. We chose to use a USB port so that our users can unleash their creativity and extend the speaker with other USB accessories.
Besides the disco ball, we are developing three other modular lights: Mood Light, Star Light, and Flame Light. We would love to hear what interesting ideas you have! We have seen concepts for a mosquito repellent module, fan module and other novel ideas.
Mood Light
With the Mood Light module, Partier gives a gentle ambient light that is perfect for relaxing. The light comes with a steady mode, and a pulse mode where cycles through four colors with a slow, calming pulse.

  The cozy mood light makes a good companion for kids, especially those that are afraid of the dark. Play a lullaby or a bedtime story with Partier and watch them drift off to dreamland under the soothing mood light.

 Adults love the mood light too. They are ideal for relaxing. The mood light also creates a romantic ambiance when you want to slow down and get intimate with the special someone.
 Star Light 
Put the Starlight module on Partier and turn your kid’s room into a starry sky. Fuel their imagination and generate hours of fun playing under the stars. Camp under the stars in their bedroom. Or become a space pirate surfing through the galaxy. With the Star Mood, imagination is the limit. And kids have unlimited imagination.

 Go a step further and play songs to further enhance the mood. Fancy being under the stars with Star Wars tunes playing in the background? Of course, the Star Mood also works well with lullabies or bedtime stories.
Flame Light
We take the mood light a step further with the Flame Light module. The light imitates the look of fire for that extra coziness and romantic mood. The flame flickers and dances like a real flame to help you relax with your favorite tunes.
Enjoy the comfort of a flame light without the dangers of a fire hazard.

The dancing speaker has LED lights all around the speaker's body that lights up based on the music. This further enhances the lighting effect and boosts the mood at a party, create a romantic ambiance if you want, and most importantly, use it wherever you are.

810,1201043963,"A dramatic crime series based on the real life events of Michael Gambino and his experiences growing up in Las Vegas. Michael was born and raised in Las Vegas; his childhood was filled with great times but also experienced some traumatic events because of his fathers’ history of working with the Italian Mafia. Although Michael had limited contact with these individuals, his childhood experiences gave him insight on what would eventually become his reality, running a crew of under age kids that operated the most successful ring of illegal activities for approximately 6 years. These activities began with the production of fake id’s for his high school friends which ultimately turned into his crew and slowly grew into a nationwide operation that developed into much more than what had ever been intended. After several years of drug running, illegal nightclub operations, international travel, credit card fraud, and wild nights with exotic dancers, they received pressure from local and federal law enforcement, Michael and his crew was able to make a clean exit and conform, somewhat to society. These stories closely represent the actual events that took place during their time."

Cornwall. To make the most of this opportunity I have launched this Kickstarter campaign to support me whilst in Cornwall.
Whilst the goal has been reached additional funds will be used to frame and prepare works for exhibition.
 thankyou for your support!
Studios where I will work this autumn
The reason why it is important for me to spend time in St Ives this autumn is to bring to creation a series of paintings 'Magic Metals and Megaliths'. The project involves walking ancient footpaths and routes of pilgrimage around the peninsula seeking out sea tales, tin mines, wreck sites, scared wells and megaliths. I will for the first month be drawing and painting outside directly from the landscape. I will use historical documents alongside myths and (fictitious) Cornish tales to create the new works. Working with the method that I have developed over many years, I will collect and collage primary research to produce scenes of magical realism that I will then paint.
 
The kick starter works in that when people invest in the project by pledging money I will send them an original art work or a print from St Ives.

Autumn in Cornwall holds great appeal for me since most tourists will have left and the coastal weather will be at its most dramatic, potentially making for excellent painting atmosphere!
I am looking to raise at least 2500 euros to contribute to the purchase of travel tickets, art materials and transportation of works.
I have included a variety of rewards so you can pledge as little or as much as you like. Every reward will be unique to my time in St Ives. These paintings and prints are limited to the duration of the campaign. I have included special rewards for those patrons able to visit me in St Ives, I hope you can join me on the adventure!

812,1708212109,"Beautiful girls look at you from fantastic photo pictures by Alexandr Furdui…
 How do they look in real life? Curious?
They will appease your curiosity!
 This project was created for revealing a natural beauty of models, who are posing for fantasy style photo pictures.
Sexy girls will show themselves for what they are in real life, without the fantastic costumes and accessories, with minimal retouching.
 You can also see changing the appearance of models in the process of creating photo pictures to illustrate the mystical tale. Changes, based on photographer's vision.
Photos that you will see are only slightly processed to maximally preserve the naturalness and natural beauty of the models.
Photo pictures and illustrations on the contrary will greatly drawn art photographer, to correspond to the artistic vision of the image of the author. Here tale characters can be faintly similar, and maybe do not look like models, who posed for the creation of this image. This fact will only increase the interest of viewers to the natural photos of models - it is always interesting to compare original image and fantastic one.
  Alexander Furdui – photographer, artist and decorator . He worked with one of the world's most famous erotic magazines - PENTHOUSE , worked in the show-business and advertising, participated in international exhibitions.
   Alexander works in two opposite styles - light and dark. But the favorite - style imitating old paintings of the Renaissance.
 Sometimes photographer creates ""aerial"" photos in a light style.
  Now he is working on illustrations for the Fantasy book - a mystical fairy tale for adults, in which the beautiful girls - the Amazon, the Priestess, Fairies - reveals the secrets of the Universe, supernatural mystery, parallel worlds, and of course our ""manifestation"" of the world.
    Alexander creates the costumes and accessories for the fairy-tale characters:
    For sure you agree with us - in these costumes our models looks incredibly beautiful !!! Militancy and tender, erotic and at the same time inaccessible ... Your help, dear sponsors, your support will help to continue creating such beautiful photos, and thousands of readers will be able to enjoy sexy Amazons girls pictures!
To live ... yes, just to live ... Alexander is forced to shoot the wedding. Of course it's fine - giving happiness to the newlyweds and their families, but it is only a few dozen people !!! And this takes valuable time and wasted talent of the photographer ...
 And you, dear sponsors, now decide the fate of these wonderful pictures !!! By sponsoring work of Alexander, you hereby release the photographer from having to spend precious time on the shooting minor personal orders (wedding photos).
And I sure you'll agree that the talent of Alexander, should be use in more ambitious projects, his fantastic photo pictures will bring aesthetic pleasure to a lot more people who will enjoy the beautiful Amazons!
Please help Alexandr finish his Fantastic book he has been working for 3 years so he can show it to you!
 The finished book will be a beautiful representation of both - the art of photography and the beauty of Amazons girls, hard bound with museum-quality high-resolution prints to show the finest detail of every single exquisite shot!
 While Alexandr working on the illustrations for his mystical tale, he makes a large number of pictures, which no one will ever see ... - it's sad. But on this project you will see beautiful girls, models, posing for pictures in the process, as well as after the main shooting - just doing erotic photos, shoot for fun. And of course, you will see the result of their main work - photo pictures and calendars in style Fantasy.
    Now we want introduce to you our sexy models:
- The main model is – Kira.
              • Second one is - Zara.
           • And meet – Arnida

814,427471697,"There's no doubt that Morris Offspring is a massive part of the lives of those involved in it. It is huge, it is unyielding, it is exhausting and it is addictive. Whether watching or dancing, it's more than a morris team, it's a furnace of emotion, creativity and power. 
Nevertheless, Morris Offspring's exhilarating, exciting, beautiful journey is almost at an end.  One final project - The Furnace - a collaboration with Faustus is underway and we passionately believe the importance of filming and documenting this last project.  
We were successful in obtaining Arts Council England funding, which has enabled a tour of UK venues for these two innovative groups. This Kickstarter project is about making the most of that funding and ensuring that the legacy it creates is maximised. 
A reoccurring issue for morris dancers is negative public attitude towards morris, something often reinforced by the media! Then again, how can the media know to portray it otherwise if evidence is not regularly provided? Much of the media has a set idea of morris dance, and while true in places, it is not the only shape of it and we would like Morris Offspring's legacy to counter that image. 
My Kickstarter project allows us to professionally film The Furnace and create a series of 2-3 mini-films that capture the spirit of Offspring ‘behind the scenes’: an insight into our methods, approach and personalities. 
I am particularly proud of the quality of artwork and photography associated with Offspring and would like to find a way to exhibit this. If we manage to exceed the target, then we can build on the publicity surrounding the project, and also create a permanent online exhibition of photos and film. 
Over the last ten years with masses of support from team members past and present, friends and family, Morris Offspring have made some remarkable achievements. 
From the very first performance, Flame, commissioned by Sidmouth International Festival for which Laurel gathered 12 dancers and enlisted Chris Wood & The English Acoustic Collective in 2003 - to 2004's repeat performance with an emerging Spiers and Boden. On English Ground was to 2006's 10-day tour of UK Arts Centres and appearance on the BBC2 Culture Show - not to mention a standing ovation for the appearance at Cropredy with the Morris On band. Amazing times. After a second show, Rising, there was a period of downtime while seemingly everyone had children then the team reemerged with a completely new line up of young dancers for 2011's colossal Arts Council England and PRSF funded spectacular event, Must Come Down bringing 36 young morris dancers from England, America and Canada together with musicians including Jackie Oates and storyteller Debs Newbold. The performance had that same electrifying vibe that the first show back in 2003 had - but for a whole new set of dancers, musicians and audience. The dancers decided to reform Morris Offspring and cram as much in as possible before the return trip to the USA.  So we've written fiendish new material, we've danced to a 200-piece community choir at the South Bank and journeyed to Ulverston and Sheffield. We even taught morris to conference delegates for WWF! All of this would have been impossible without unwavering support from the English Folk Dance and Song Society (and my Mum & Dad). 
Nevertheless, the workload and the finances are unsustainable where there is no option for full-time touring and 2013 sees the final outing for Morris Offspring. Your support in helping us capture these last days on film and photo for those who were unable to see the live work will be invaluable. We are aware that not everyone in the morris world values our work, we are also aware of the huge impact we have had on others, and indeed on how many people outside 'the scene' view morris. 
If there's one thing we've learnt on this incredible journey, it's that Morris is a survivor, a true dance of the people that will never be tamed and will always bring a heady mix of joy and embarrassment wherever it goes. We hope we've struck a good balance between these two vital life forces and sincerely hope we capture the best moments of both on this one last massive trip."

The Black and White Wool Trenchcoat; 8 Coats in 1
Soversa...So Versatile. The new premium high street womenswear clothing  brand, launching in July 2020. A brand concept that provides a unique and innovative clothing solution, through timeless, quality and modern fashion pieces that would add and compliment the customer’s current  wardrobe. A concept idea that was born over 10 years ago from the Founders London College of Fashion Graduate Collection; a concept that now feels the perfect time to launch.
The range will start with a women’s outerwear range, based on the  multi wear feature, allowing one jacket to be worn in a variety of  different ways through the use of clever pattern cutting, fastenings and  layering, in a stylish and discreet manner.
The Multifunctional Trenchcoat is the brainchild of this concept and will be the first product, made in traditional cotton twill and also wool for the launch of the Autumn/Winter Collection. 
Soversa goes against the grain and the normalities of the fashion  industry – it is not about fast fashion, throwaway trends, catwalk copies or designer labels. It is a brand that wants to be loved, worn and invested into by the customer. Styles that can be used over and over again, season after season and personalised over seasons, so it remains  a wardrobe cherished staple and go-to item.
We HATE waste. Pure and simple. In this quickly evolving world where the Climate Crisis is on all of our minds daily, it is crucial that we play a key role in ensuring our products are long lasting and good quality with minimal impact on the planet.
Did you know that many designer labels produce thousands of meters of fabric and some of it is never used so sits unused to waste whilst they produce new fabrics every season? What we do here at Soversa is we utilise excess high quality fabrics and we make our collections from them - meaning you get a fantastic high quality product made from fabrics that could have ended up in landfill polluting our planet further!
By creating a product that can be styled in 8 different ways, we are ensuring that you, the consumer can still have the luxury of different styling whilst minimising your fashion purchases and global textile waste footprint and we believe that is the future of fashion!

Sophie is the Founder behind the brand and has over 10 years experience in the fashion industry, after studying at the renowned London College of Fashion, studying Product Design Development for the Fashion Industry, gaining a First Class BA Honours Degree.
Sophie went on to work for a range of brands on the high street and at brand level, both supplier and retail side, gaining a 360 understanding of the retail business and manufacturing industry, learning how they operate, successes and failures, all of which has led  Sophie to launch Soversa. Alongside this Sophie is a Short Courses Design Tutor at the London College of Fashion, teaching Fashion Design  and Introduction to Fashion courses out of school term time.
The brainchild of the concept started with the Trenchcoat, however we have many ideas to evolve this concept through other products in the range, not necessarily having a physical functional feature, but  every piece in the collection will be versatile.
A lot of love, care and attention has been invested into the company and with a little help, we are aiming to launch the brand to market in July 2020; the scale and collection will depend on how much we raise. 
We are passionate about our brand and concept, however to make the best  impact in the saturated and struggling fashion industry, we want to test the market and build a community of backers and supporters who can help shape the brand and collection and continue with our launch for July  2020. Kickstarter feels the perfect platform to do this.

816,1655700101,"Right in the middle of New York's ever-energetic East Village neighborhood lies Jimmy's No 43, a craft beer pub located in a subterranean space which was once a Ukrainian supper club. Head down the hallway behind the bar and you will find the Back Room where many a play has been workshopped, comedians had their first stage experience, and playwrights see their work first come to life.
Owner Jimmy Carbone is a man with a big heart. He cares about locally grown food products, (most of the menu is locally sourced from small farmers) finely crafted beers, (Jimmy created the Good Beer Seal) and the health of the arts in his community. So much so that in 2005 and 2009, Jimmy was recipient of the title “Local Hero” from NYC Arts. Today, he serves on boards of all types, but beyond this he knows the arts need a space to workshop and grow their work. 
For the past seven years, Jimmy has worked with local arts organizations to give them space in the Back Room to grow their work and their audiences. Most of this is given as an in-kind donation, knowing the needs of the arts and their small budgets. Groups like Rising Phoenix Repertory, ESPA Primary Stages Program, id Theater have held workshops of new productions in the space. The quality of the work is tremendous, and great performers-- including Reggie Watts and Ben Walker-- have spent some time on the small stage of the Back Room. 
These committed artists deserve to have a better facility to work, and Jimmy's No 43 does not have the cash to make those improvements- especially after dealing with the loss of revenue from Sandy and the post-storm recuperation period. 
We need your help to pay for upgrades for the room: 
1) Sound System: speakers, sound board, general A/V capabilities
2) Lighting: and running more electricity to the back room to make that possible
3) Deep Clean: the room needs to be cleaned, walls painted, floors buffed and then maintained!
4) Heating and Cooling: both sides of the coin need to be improved
5) Ongoing Operating Costs: cost of electricity, managing the calendar, and other things

817,512193647,"About the Exhibit: Operation Frame
The name of the exhibit is ""Operation Frame"" because, quite frankly, I need frames. The market in Brazil is brutal for emerging visual artists and I almost went broke preparing and framing the paintings for my last exhibit. I simply can't do that again, so I need your help to make this exhibit break even at the very least.
I need these frames to give the exhibit a professional look. This exhibit is important because it will be in the city center of Curitiba, Brazil, close to the city's most important art fair during a busy time of year, in February - just before Carnival. 
But it's not all about the phyisical frames because each of these paintings are also snapshots in time. For me, artistically, this is an important concept because it means that we can freeze - or frame - the world to help us remember that place in that moment in time, or maybe to help us hold that dream in place for when we arrive in the future. 
So by framing these paintings, I’m not only talking about the actual frames, but our imaginations as well. If you look at a painting of bottles, where does that take you? How about one of flowers or one of Barcelona? My hope is to create an exhibit that stops time for people, and what better way to do that than to have all the paintings framed.
Barcelona Rooftops
What I'm Asking:
I am asking for your support to help with framing and other hanging supplies to make this exhibit more professional. I need help with six or seven frames, which are expensive and beyond my financial means. Without your help I will not be able to frame these or exhibit these paintings.
Una Vista de Ardales
What You Get:
What do you get out of this? Obviously the artistic rewards as a result of your pledges (from contribution recognition to reusable greeting cards to postcards from Brasil (with Brazilian stamps!) to original artwork to commissioned paintings), but it's more than that. You get the opportunity to help an emerging artist get his name out there and show his work. All too often the world asks artists of all types to work for free: Kickstarter campaigns such as this help to break those expectations and allow artists to create more freely and, to be blunt, put food on the table and pay rent.
Several of the to-be exhibited pieces are available as rewards here on Kickstarter. You can see those in this blurb. The rest will be available for purchase at the exhibit.
Study of Bottles
About Me:
These are expressionist paintings painted by me, Greg Mason Burns, and were created during my time in Curitiba, Brazil. 
I am a painter who uses bold colors to create expressive paintings. My artistic inspiration is Ernest Hemingway, thus my paintings are declarative in nature. Brazil has many contrasts in it's culture, and these have greatly influenced my emotions and, thus, my art.
I originally left my job in healthcare finance in Boston to pursue my more natural creative side. My first landing spot was in Chile (without knowing a word of Spanish), but I met a girl from Brazil and followed her there (without knowing a word of Portuguese), which is where I currently live (I can order a beer in Portuguese now). I am originally from Bar Harbor, Maine, and am a graduate of both the University of Maine and the University of Edinburgh.

Untitled Abstract #3"
818,1994562630,"Male nudity has been hiding in the dark for too long.  It is often seen as taboo and no where near as popular in modern photography as the female nude.
Google the word NUDE and you will find thousands of images of nude women but very few men. And when you do find nude men it is usually in the form of pornographic material. It is very hard to find artistic or even just non pornographic male nude images.
I'm looking to break this trend with a series of images dedicated to the male nude in all his glory. Most importantly I will not be photographing a model. This will be a real person with real emotions and real character. Shoots will take place at real locations and will not involve elaborate studio set ups. Follow me on this journey of discovery as I look to lift the veil of secrecy over male nudity and the impact it has on contemporary photography."

My name is Camilla Isola, aka RAE, I am a London based dance artist looking for funds to create a new contemporary dance piece which will be performed on the 14th of January at Resolution 2017 at The Place in London.

Have you ever heard about Resolution?

Well, if not, Resolution is a world renowned dance platform, which gives young choreographers and companies the possibility to show their work in a triple bill night. 
For this occasion I decided to create a brand new piece, Unravel, le Bolero, in collaboration with 11 male and female dancers from Laban, The Place and Rambert. The work interrogates on what drives humans to seek for body contact, sometimes delicate others rough.
Set in a dark place, a house room, a club, a night city landscape, they dance on the notes of a contemporary version of Bolero. Unaware someone is looking, they tangle together losing control while the music and the lights gradually expose the scene.

Who is RAE Dance Collective?

820,442104134,"The Camden Neighborhood of North Minneapolis, specifically the area between 42nd and 53rd on Lyndale Ave owes much of its roots to the lumber industry. From the 1880 until 1930, Camden produced more lumber then anywhere else in the world. With the decline of pine in the northern regions of Minnesota, the industry shifted in the area and the story of the Camden sawmills is all but a distant memory for the community.
C.A. SMITH Early 1900's
 My project serves to provide local business around Camden with unique photos of its history with a emphasis on past and present photos of existing businesses and structures from similar vantage points. Some of the ideas I have are blended photos going from B&W to color, people: then and now and how the landscape has changed in and around Weber Park. 
Here's a good example of what I hope my end product to look like in the businesses
Here's some examples of some of the structures I might use.
Bell Boarding House in the past.
and in the Present!
 I'm hoping to capture much better current pictures, so please don't judge the results off these examples!
I plan to capture at least 15 different structures and vantage points over the course of 2015 and intend on completion to be around September with hopes of the final project being displayed in businesses this coming Fall 2015
If this project is successful, I plan to also raise funds for a museum in the streets around the Camden Historic Lumber District (C.H.i.L.D.)
I plan to use funds for a decent DSLR camera upgrade, enlargements,cost of historical photos

My name is John Withee, and I am the creator of the Construction Paper Tarot deck. I'm a poet, artist, and writer from the improbable little town of Kalamazoo, and most of my public work is curated at The Cucumber Boat (fb, insta, .com)

My interest in tarot came to me many years ago, and has been an indispensable meditation practice for me, not just for transformative moments, but living day by day as well. Since then, Construction Paper Tarot has been used for readings by folks just like you in many countries across the world. Awesome!
In 2014 I visited an artist collective that had specialized in mosaics in the 1990's. I was impressed and wanted to learn how to do it myself, but spent the following years returning to grad school for poetry. I finally have time to focus on this project!

I like to look at Mosaic Tarot as intergenerational communication. I want my art to be able to speak to someone fifty or a hundred years into the future without losing its ielevancy. I want future viewers of Mosaic Tarot to be able to tap into an ancient wisdom for the unimaginable challenges that lie ahead.
If you’re anything like me, you’ve probably spent some time wondering about how such a small person can make a difference in such a big world. For me, that starts right here with my friends and neighbors in Kalamazoo! There are plenty of people who need help and assistance right in my backyard. So to that end, 10% of the sales of these original mosaics will be donated to our local YWCA, where my best friend is a crisis volunteer. Further donations from the project will benefit Urban Alliance, the Tree of Life School, the future Edison Chapel, and many more organizations that fight back directly against poverty and foster community among people in immediate need in the city that I love so much. You are going to be able to watch your donation to this kickstarter grow and grow into something that is locally transformative in so many different ways.
So what is it already?! Let me tell you.
I am creating 78 individual mosaics from an estimated 400,000 individually broken, chosen, placed, mortared, grouted and cleaned pieces of broken glazed ceramic tile. About 2/3rds of them will be fifteen square feet in size; the rest, smaller or larger, depending on a number of factors, such as need for greater detail or particular significance. Ultimately the project may reach a maximum of 2,932 square feet, being composed of somewhere between 152-196 15-square-foot panels.  Those decisions are mostly dependent on time constraints.  I want to make them as detailed as I can -- but I *also* want to make sure *you* get your decks sooner rather than later!
As part of my artistic process, I smash tiles with a hammer. It is important to me that each piece is “repurposed from a moment of chaos,” something that happens to people from time to time. 
Ultimately, much of the project is going to make and early victory lap in September of 2020 when the project will be painfully and carefully moved up to Grand Rapids for ArtPrize, and decks will print and ship shortly after.  But there are going to be a lot of fun stops along the way!
I can’t do this alone. In addition to this Kickstarter, I am pursuing avenues with local grants, and there are even more ways to get involved with this project that you’ll want to check out at thecucumberboat.com! 
In the past, I have included kickstarter backers in decision-making processes, such as the layout and design of the cards you will receive. So climb aboard, poke around, and let’s make this ambitious and beautiful project to life!
There have already been many people who have thrown essential support behind this project over the years, primarily Mike Braganini for guidance on the medium, Sarah Harber for building the website, and many more – and I want you to be a part of it! "

WHAT'S THE IDEA?
The idea is simple: we grow as artists when we are confronted with new perspectives, new ideas, new ways of creating.  And when artists grow, that effect is compounded into the community because it encourages and inspires others to push their own boundaries.
Julie and Charlotte met in Paris in 2015 and collaborated on a shoot together.  Since then, they've kept in touch and have been discussing project ideas.  This residency project will allow them to work together again in a structured way that allows them to combine their different approaches to self-portraiture and to explore ideas of intimacy, space, and to share each other's inner worlds with all of you.
For 2 weeks, in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, Julie and Charlotte will explore ideas and create a unique series of self-portraits and duos that will challenge each other's boundaries and styles.
Julie and Charlotte's similar but unique self-portrait styles.
Who is Julie?  Who is Charlotte?
Julie Laurin: Fine art photographer who has worked mostly in Ottawa and Montreal.  She specializes in creative shoots, theatre and performing arts photography as well as self-portraiture.  Julie has a wacky world - she explores the beauty in the grotesque, the pain in the everyday, the passion in the banal.
Charlotte Forest: Primarily a theatre actress and director in Paris, Charlotte took up photography in 2010, mainly doing set photography but also producing a large body of work in self-portraiture.  Charlotte lets us into her world in an intimate, almost voyeuristic way.  Her world is delicate and silent, raw and introspective.  She explores sex, love, loneliness, pain, distance and closeness.
In a way, Julie and Charlotte have two very different styles.  And yet, they tend to explore the same topics.  The work they produce individually reaches into your ribcage - the work they will produce together will touch your heart.
A comparison of Julie and Charlotte's exploration of self-portraiture with others.
The Residency: Creation
During the 2 week residency, Julie and Charlotte will endeavour to produce an entire body of work that will revolve around an agreed-to theme.  They will also keep a journal with random ideas, thoughts, sketches and storyboards.  
The entire process will be shared with you on Facebook!
The Residency: Exhibition
The series produced by this residency will be on display at a big exhibition of Julie's work in Montreal in August 2017.  There are also plans to exhibit this work in Paris.
The series will also be on display on a special page on julielaurin.com
Quel est le concept? 
L’idée est simple : c’est en nous confrontant à de nouvelles façons de penser, de créer, que nous grandissons en tant qu’artistes. Et lorsque l’artiste grandit, s’enrichit, c’est toute sa communauté qui en bénéficie, en encourageant et inspirant d’autres encore à repousser leurs limites. Julie et Charlotte se sont rencontrées à Paris en 2015, ce qui fut l’occasion d’un shooting photo. Depuis elles ont gardé contact et se parlent régulièrement de leurs idées, envies et projets. 
Cette résidence sera l’occasion pour elles de retravailler ensemble sur un projet qui leur tient à cœur à toutes les deux. Elles pourront s’inspirer l’une de l’autre, comparer, combiner, recréer leurs façons d’appréhender l’autoportrait et jouer avec les notions d’intimité, d’espace … et de vous inviter dans leur monde intérieur. Pendant ces deux semaines à Ottawa en Ontario au Canada, Julie et Charlotte vont créer une série d’autoportraits et de duos qui leur permettra de repousser leurs propres limites et d’explorer de nouveaux styles. 
Qui sont Julie et Charlotte? 
Julie : Photographe Fine art, elle travaille essentiellement à Ottawa et Montréal. Elle est spécialisée dans la photo d’art et les autoportraits, mais photographie également du théâtre et du spectacle vivant. Julie a un univers un peu dingue, elle aime trouver la beauté dans le grotesque, la douleur dans le tous les jours, la passion dans le banal. 
Charlotte : Actrice et metteure en scène à Paris, Charlotte a commencé la photographie en 2010. Beaucoup photographe plateau, elle produit également un grand nombre d’autoportraits. Charlotte nous laisse entrer dans son monde de manière presque intime et voyeur. Son monde est délicat et secret, brut et introspectif. Elle explore l’amour, le sexe, la solitude, la douleur, la distance et l’intimité. 
D’une certaine manière Julie et Charlotte ont deux styles différents et pourtant elles se retrouvent sur les mêmes thèmes. Ce qu’elles produisent chacune de leur côté touchent un point sensible, alors imaginez ce qu’elles vont faire ensemble.
La résidence : Création 
Pendant cette résidence de deux semaines Julie et Charlotte vont produire un ensemble d’œuvre autour d’un thème prédéfini. Elles tiendront également un carnet de bord de leur aventure avec les différentes idées, pensées, croquis et storyboards. Tout cela sera bien évidemment partagé avec vous sur Facebook ! 
La résidence : L’exposition 
La série qui résultera de cette résidence fera partie de l’exposition de Julie à Montréal en Aout 2017. Et il est déjà question d’exposer ce travail à Paris. La série sera visible également sur une page spéciale sur julielaurin.com

From the mean streets of New York to far-flung colonies of the future, cities are centers of adventure, conflict, and battle.  Cities are where wars are started, fought, and ended! 
After the success of the first Monster Scenery Kickstarter featuring trees, hills, and other natural scenery, Monster Fight Club is ready to present its second Monster Scenery campaign: modular city buildings!  
There’s no paper or cardboard here - every wall is sturdy, tempered hardboard. Every wall is full color on both sides, with tough UV-cured inks that will look good for years to come. 
Want to see Sophie & John put together and take apart a few buildings? Check it out:
PLAY

The walls fit snugly into detailed plastic corners, so you can assemble, disassemble, and reassemble your buildings quickly and easily. Their strength also means you can stack them to make multi-level buildings with playable balconies and roofs.  
If you want to take your games inside the buildings, have no fear!  The roofs and floors are removable to create lots of playable interior spaces: perfect for roleplaying games and skirmish miniature games!


 To see everything that comes in the Metropolis Pack Click Here
To see everything that comes in the Trees and Hills Pack Click Here
Each bundle includes enough sculpted plastic corners and connectors to assemble the buildings as shown.  The corner connectors work with all wall sizes, so you can mix and match walls from different styles and sizes. Each bundle is available in one of three styles: classic brick, modern concrete, or industrial steel. All the walls in a bundle will be the same style. 
The windows are all the same size and are removable. You can move windows between different styles.  
Each building wall features two stories of windows and measures about 5.5""(140mm) tall.  The buildings in each bundle also include a removable interior floor.  The small walls are about 5.5"" (140mm) wide, the medium walls are about 8.5"" (220mm) wide, and the large walls are about 11.75"" (300mm) wide. 
For example, the medium square building in the City Block Bundle is 8.5"" wide x  8.5"" deep x 5.5"" tall.  In metric, that's 22cm wide x 22cm deep x 14cm tall. The medium skyscraper pictured above is made from three of those buildings, stacked on each other.  It has the same size footprint, but is over 16"" (42cm) tall!   
The more bundles you have in your collection, the more options you’ll have for building your unique city!
The buildings are the core of the Monster Metropolis Building System, but we also have lots of great sculpted details you can add to your city: signs, fences, dumpsters, and lots more! Pick which ones you'd like and add their value to your pledge amount. You can also choose add-ons during the pledge manager, after the campaign.
Individual buildings are also available. If you want to buy only Add-ons and/or individual buildings, choose the “Scouting Mission” pledge level, for the total value of everything you’d like in your pledge. 
Each individual building is two stories and about 5.5"" (140mm) tall. When buying buildings individually, you can choose the style for each building separately.
Sidewalks & Signs Add-on Set (building not included)
Full-color sidewalks wrap around your buildings to tie them into any gaming surface. Each sidewalk set comes with 14 sidewalk corner pieces, in three different sizes.  You can combine the sidewalk corners to surround any size Monster Metropolis building.  
This Add-On set also includes 10 signs, with connectors to attach them to your buildings' walls.
Chain-link Fences set - now with bonus Steel Drum!
Each Chain-link Fences Add-on includes ten sections of fencing, plus enough connectors to make a fence four feet (120cm) long!  Chain-link fences are great additions to battlefields since they block movement without impeding shooting.  Each set comes with a spool of barbed wire which can be coiled and placed on top of your fences, or used separately.  The spool is also a detailed piece of scenery, appropriate for 28-32mm figures. 
Chain-link fences surround overgrown city lots
The Reinforced Fences add-on includes six sections of reinforced fencing, fortified with solid materials and two door sections. With the included connectors, you'll have enough to make over two feet (72 cm) of reinforced fencing. The Reinforced Fences look great mixed with the Chain-link fences. Each set also comes with a spool of barbed wire which can be coiled and placed on top of your fences, or used separately. The spool is a detailed piece of scenery, appropriate for 28-32mm figures.
Fire Escape and Ladders (building not included)

Don’t have a jump-pack? Left your grappling hooks at home? What better way to move up to the next level than with few sets of stairs! Each stairs add-on includes four sets of stairs, with enough platforms and connectors to add exterior stairs to a four-story building.  Each set also includes 4 ladders. Each ladder spans two building stories (one wall piece). Ladders can also be combined to span taller buildings. Every floor and roof includes a pop-out section where you can add a set of stairs. 
Brick building shown with fire escapes and ladders
Industrial Cargo Add-on Set (figure not included)
The Industrial Cargo Add-on includes 7 Pallets, 16 Barrels (8 of each type), and 16 Boxes.  The barrels are tall enough for a 28-32mm figure to take cover behind without fully blocking their line of sight.  Cargo pallets make great objectives too!

The Graffiti Walls includes five new walls: 2 small, 2 medium, and 1 long. Each wall is illustrated with urban street art on both sides. Each set also includes five plastic building corners, so you'll have enough to expand your city. Graffiti Wall add-ons are available for all three building styles: brick, concrete, and industrial.
City Streets set - now includes free Power Conduit!
The City Streets set includes 4 Street Lights, 2 bus stops with movable benches, 8 protective bollards, a drop box, and 3 terminals.  The terminals make great objectives and get serve as public data terminals,  modern ATMs, or sci-fi access points. The bigger your city, the more of these you'll need to fill out your city's sidewalks!

Vents & Ducts Add-on Set (figure not included)
A key character in countless action movies, this set of vents and ducts looks good running horizontally or vertically on your buildings' walls.  It also looks great and provides cover when placed on the rooftops.  Each set includes 28 pieces: 14 straight, 6 connectors, and 6 corners. Combined, it's over 4 feet (120cm) long!
Pipe System Add-On Set (figure not included)
Each Pipe System add-on includes two long pipes, two short pipes, three corner bends, and enough connectors to attach all the pipes.   Add more detail to your industrial buildings and give your figures extra places to climb and take cover.  They also look great used separately, running closer to the ground. 

Includes 21 pieces - Figure not Included

Desperate times sometimes call for desperate measures: like taking cover in a dumpster full of trash! The Alley Garbage set includes 2 Dumpsters with removable trash-inserts, four different discarded tire pieces, 2 single garbage bags, a triple garbage bag, and 3 trash cans with removable lids.

Monster Fight Club Bring Their Metropolis Terrain to Kickstarter
For this campaign, we’re going to be doing the bulk of the manufacturing ourselves, in the US, which will reduce shipping times and avoid delays. 
All orders will be shipped directly from our offices in the USA. This allows us to offer affordable, $20 flat-rate shipping with the contiguous 48 states. That's roughly the cost to ship one Building Bundle. If you're getting more than one bundle, you're saving money on shipping.  All other orders will be charged actual shipping costs to their location, including all non-US addresses, Alaska, Hawaii, and other overseas US addresses.
Keep in mind, these buildings are made from dense, durable hardboard and a box full of them is heavy.  International shipping is going to be relatively expensive. 
These are shipped from the US and you'll be responsible for any import taxes or duties. If you have questions about international shipping costs, please email us: info@monsterfightclub.com.
Due to the size of the rewards and the risk of bounce back, we cannot ship to PO Boxes either domestically or internationally.
Note On 3D Files 
We’ve gotten lots of requests for STLs since launching our original scenery Kickstarter.  We weren’t originally intending to release our 3D files, but the recent global pandemic has changed our minds.  These days, international shipping is slowed, gamers are spending more time at home, and more people are exploring 3D printing. If releasing the 3D files allows more people around the world to enjoy the scenery we’ve proudly made, that’s a win in our books!  
All our 3D pieces are designed for 3D printing.  If your pledge includes digital files, you should receive the files within 30 days of the end of the Kickstarter. You’ll be getting the same files we’ve used.  All the STL files will be water-tight and tested on our in-house Form3 printer.  Supports vary from machine to machine; files will be provided without supports. Some larger pieces may not fit onto smaller print beds.  These files were designed with resin printing in mind, but should work on FDM printers (but we haven’t test-printed every piece on a FDM machine).
Monster Fight Club is a close-knit team of hobby industry veterans whose purpose is to evolve tabletop gaming through fun and unique board game experiences; innovative accessories, terrain and models for tabletop role-playing games and wargaming; and creating distinctive pop culture collectibles.
The team behind Monster Fight Club includes many former staff members of Gale Force Nine, including its founder, John Kovaleski. Other staffers and designers have worked for companies such as Games Workshop, EA, and Digital Domain. We have been innovating tabletop terrain for well over a decade; we know how to make and mass-produce awesome looking terrain that will bring your games table to life!
REFUND POLICY  We can refund you within 14 days of the campaign’s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that’s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can’t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we’ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.  
All refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.  
This project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.  
TERMS AND CONDITIONS  By pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials, and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active. 
 If you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via e-mail to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8-week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and may lead to project delays which could impact your fellow backers. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.  
If you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. Again, we regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.  If you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project.
3D FILE AGREEMENT  By downloading any digital files, Monster Fight Club (MFC) grants you a non-transferable, non-exclusive, license to use the provided STL Files for your personal, non-commercial use.  Further, by downloading the files, you agree to the terms below.  
1) You may not share, sell, rent, sub-license, host, transfer, assign, or otherwise distribute the MFC files, or any derivative works made from the MFC files.  
2) MFC retains all intellectual property rights, of all files. This includes, but is not limited to, copyrights, patents, and trademarks.  
3) The files may not be used in any commercial way.  
4) MFC reserves the right to modify or discontinue the files at any time.  
5) MFC cannot guarantee the provided files will work on your specific machinery and may not be able to provide support.  
6) MFC reserves the right to modify these terms."

They have incredibly dumb, boring solar panels! But, they do have electronic circuits inside each one that makes millisecond decisions and each one can store FREE energy from the sun! The LED galaxies turn on at just the right time every night, and turn off again in the morning.
Please don't drive or park on these
See? They’re just like Solar FREAKING Roadways… they have solar panels, they have LED lights, they have electronics, but you don’t drive, walk, or park on them. They stand many feet over your head to capture all of the sun’s energy!
Mesmerized enemy combatants
MILITARY APPLICATIONS
Imagine hundreds of Solar FREAKING Galaxies parachuting down over enemy lines. Boring drills come out of the bottom and drive into the ground (or solid rock) while the parachute is quietly sucked back inside. The top opens up and lights up its LED galaxy lights up. The enemy is mesmerized and confused... must have a closer look. Are those real galaxies? Wham! A net flys out and captures them!  A sensor inside detects enemy capture and a built in rocket ignites taking the enemy combatants off to POW camps and gently drops them down where our troops can lock them up where they belong!
PIPE DREAMS
Reduce greenhouse gasses?  Power the nation?  Military applications?  Pipe dreams you say? Well, yes and no. I do need to buy some more pipes. 10 foot ones to be exact.  And all the rest?  One step at a time.  I brought this incredible technology to Burning Man 2013 as an Honorarium installation under the covert name “Star Stuff.” They were enjoyed by very many people. I heard a lot of ""awesome"" and ""trippy"" and ""where are the bathrooms?""
Meet you at the galaxies!
SOLAR AND HUMAN POWER
Some of these galaxy poles also had solar and human powered devices.  One was a snowball with a solar powered video from the view of a train engineer driving through snow.  Just something to bring the hot desert heat down a degree. Another was a human powered jukebox, with a dynamo crank to generate the electricity to power the electronics, and several 3D viewers with cranks to power the back lights.
Solar and Human Powered Devices
REDUCE, REUSE, RECYCLE
After brought my installation home I heeded the mantra, “reduce, reuse, recycle” and took all of my Galaxies apart. I recycled all of the big heavy ¾” ground stakes, the inner metal structural EMT pipes, and the outer PVC pipes, selling them at pennies on the dollar. I also recycled the brand new rotary hammer I used to drive the stakes into the ground and the tool to pull them back out. I still had the solar panels, lights, and frames left to recycle.
Lonely galaxy frames waiting to be recycled
SOLAR FREAKING ROADWAYS!
Then I heard about Solar FREAKING Roadways and their the plan to replace every road, freeway, and parking lot surface in America with solar powered, LED enabled glass paving panels.  What an inspiration!  Was that just art I created for Burning Man 2013? Or was it the beginning of something more?
BRINGING THEM BACK
I want to bring my Solar FREAKING Galaxies back to Burning Man for 2014 and I need your help!  This is one step toward... toward... something.  Last year, Burning Man. This year, well... Burning Man again. But next year? The whole United States of America? The World? Who can say?  I'm not thinking of paving all roads and freeways with glass I do think displaying working solar systems to 70,000 people might inspire some to think of possibilities for reducing greenhouse gasses.
REBUILDING
I still have the tops frames, the solar panels, and LED lights. I just have to turn them back into galaxies again! That's the creative and fun part. I recycled the inner metal pipes, heavy ground stakes and stake puller to Lockewood Acres Organic Farms. But they have graciously decided to loan the ones they haven't used back to me for the 2014 event! Thanks, Ben!
I still need to buy new outer pipes and a tool to drive the stakes into the ground.  And, last year a tire blew out on my way to Black Rock City, so I need a new 2 new tires.  I’m also building a little seating area in the center of the galaxy forest.  I need pipes, paint, gas to transport the project there, hardware, and other miscellaneous stuff so I can get Solar FREAKING Galaxies back to Burning Man 2014… and maybe, beyond.
Next stop... ???
If I make my goal I will at least be able to get 25 galaxy poles built and transported.   Me and my helpers are gifting many hours building, transporting, setting up and taking down.  If I can stretch it to twice that much I should be able to get close to the 50 I had last year.
Risks and Challenges"
827,882859620,"We want to make your day easier, your workout better, your ideas brighter. We want to deliver the very best protein drink on the market, one that is miles ahead of anyone else in terms of quality ingredients and truly healthful nutrition. 
Introducing Smooth Oats & Protein, the cleanest and most natural protein drink ever.
YOUR PROTEIN DRINK NEEDS A DETOX 
Protein drinks on the market today are loaded with preservatives, additives, and synthetic flavors. And they often contain high levels of heavy metals, such as cadmium, lead, and arsenic. 
Organic drinks that are supposed to be healthy for you may be just the opposite. Most of organic soy and rice protein is imported from China, where up to one fifth of fields are estimated to be contaminated with heavy metals. 
WHY ALL THOSE CHEMICALS?
We've been programmed to look at calories first. Manufacturers know this, and they replace natural ingredients with artificial. Artificial ingredients are also much cheaper, and can make the product look more appealing both in color and texture, and extend its shelf live.
Chemicals may be a great solution for the food industry, but not for us.
SMOOTH OATS & PROTEIN, THE CLEANEST AND MOST NATURAL PROTEIN DRINK
With the help of doctors, nutritionists and consumers, we’ve created Smooth Oats & Protein, the cleanest and most natural vegan protein drink available. Smooth Oats & Protein offers the best of leading-edge nutrition science combined with an uncompromising commitment to quality the natural way. And a passion for real food that tastes great. 
Smooth Oats & Protein is made from all natural ingredients, with nothing artificial added. 
It's lactose-free and soy-free, has no preservatives or GMOs.
WE HARNESSED THE HUNGER-CURBING POWER OF OATS
Smooth Oats & Protein is based on 20 years of research on how to capture the hunger-curbing power of oats. 
Have you noticed that after eating a bowl of oatmeal you don’t feel hungry for hours? That’s the soluble fiber in oats, called beta glucan, in action.
The soluble fiber in oats is one of nature’s miracles. It helps lower cholesterol, balance blood sugar levels, and keep hunger on hold making you feel full and satisfied.
Because oats help balance blood sugar levels, you're able to stick to healthy eating throughout the day and stave off those sweet cravings. 
A SIMPLE BLEND OF A FEW NATURAL INGREDIENTS YOU CAN PRONOUNCE
Real food is supposed to taste good. And real food is made from real ingredients. 
Smooth Oats & Protein is made from whole grain oats and pea protein, lightly sweetened with agave nectar, for a low glycemic index overall. That means you avoid the unhealthy spike-and-crash cycles that lead to hunger pangs, binging, and sluggishness.
We are very particular about where our ingredients come from. Our oats are grown by family farmers in Scandinavia, where there’s less pollution and a greater commitment to traditional farming methods. Recent study by EFSA analyzing more than 77 000 food samples concluded that 70.8% of foods produced in Finland are free from pesticide residuals.
The organic pea protein comes from France and is the cleanest available.
Smooth Oats & Protein contains no GMOs, no preservatives or additives. Just the pure goodness of whole grain oats and pea protein.
THE GENTLE, DELICIOUSLY SATISFYING PROTEIN DRINK BEFORE AND AFTER WORKOUT 
Let’s get real about protein. We’re not Olympic athletes. What we need is a balanced, clean, and delicious protein drink that will sustain us through a busy day and workout.
Too much protein will store in our bodies as fat, and can even harm our kidneys. That’s why our drink is balanced with just the right amount of protein.
THE SMOOTH TEAM
We are athletes and foodies, busy moms and dads, chocolate lovers, dedicated workers, and creative obsessives. We have a background in, you guessed it, natural foods, and creating brands and advertising for global companies. We are passionate about natural foods and beverages, as well as active in the GMO-Free movement, supporting natural methods of farming that produce cleaner, more flavorful foods.
OAT DRINK, INTERRUPTED
In 2011 we launched Simpli, the first vegan oat-smoothie on the US market. In just 18 months, Simpli OatShake won three major industry awards and got into 2000 stores, including Whole Foods, Wegmans, Mollie Stones, and the likes.  
Our European manufacturer had other plans. They stopped supplying and sold the factory, with devastating consequences to our business in the United States.
However, consumers were still asking for the product two years later, so we know there's demand for delicious nondairy oat drinks. 
For the past two years we've been working on an improved recipe and process, and found a committed co-packer in the United States.
RAISING FUNDS FOR THE FIRST PRODUCTION RUN 
We have the recipe, and we've sourced the ingredients. We know how to make, package, market, and distribute this fantastic and much-needed new product. Now we just have to get the engine revved up, and we are asking for your help.
We are raising money to pay for the first production run. You can help us make this healthy and delicious drink available to distributors (and you!) by November 2015. 
Every dollar counts and brings us closer to achieving our goal. Your support is essential for this drink to reach the marketplace. Your support also signals to the US food industry that its time for healthier, more natural choices.

We made it! Megan and I are so thankful for all of your generous contributions. We've been hard at work building the show and we can't wait to share it with you.
Although we've reached our goal please still consider making a contribution. We are hoping to raise some additional funds to do things like: hire a lighting designer, hire additional performers, pay our stage manager more than a pittance, buy materials for scenic elements, and countless other things that have come up in our rehearsal process.
We hope to see you at the show in September. Tickets are now available here.

A Dance Theater Duet.
Megan and Mason met in 2011 and started working together for the first time in 2012. They knew it was a match made in heaven when, at their first rehearsal, they spent 3 hours pretending they were Gremlins giving a mansion tour. This is Mason's first evening-length work in Philadelphia, and his first time self-producing. This is Megan's first time co-creating a piece. Megan thinks it's dance. Mason thinks it's theater. They both can't wait to share it with you. 
About MMMM.
Transforming into a variety of scientists, gurus, animals, plants, and minerals, Megan and Mason go out of their minds and into the unknown to investigate human consciousness. Mining the Mine of the Mind for Minderals is what happens when dance, theater, neuroscience, and spirituality collide in a TED talk gone wild format. Can you dig it?
MMMM draws from the work of scientists, philosophers, and spiritual teachers like:
Marco Iacoboni, Jill Bolte Taylor, Antonio DaMasio, V.S. Ramachandran, Daniel Dennet, Alva Noë, Eckhart Tolle, Chögyam Trungpa, Pema Chödrön, and many more.
It has been influenced by Megan and Mason's shared practice of improvisational dance, their unusual sense of humor, and obsession with shifting physical and mental states.
The performance will feature visual design by Ryan W. Kelly and sound design by Michael Kiley.
What we need.
We are asking for your help to raise $3500. The money would cover all of the costs of the production including the Philadelphia Fringe Festival fee, renting the Jolie Laide Gallery for rehearsals and performance, posters and cards, insurance, paying our stage manager, and collaborating artists.

830,120768934,"HELP US STRETCH! If Pens Plus Pals can reach a total fo 150 backers, custom pencils will be added to the first stationery set for ALL levels of P+P supporters!
As any good tween of the mid-90’s, I remember reading my Teen Beat magazine and eagerly cutting out the mail-in advert for a pen pal. The anticipation of waiting to receive the identity of my pen pal was almost as excruciating as waiting to find out if Nickelodeon was going to take over my school (they never did). I'd spend hours crafting the perfect letters to my new friends from exotic places like Akron and Lubbock!
Who wouldn't want to be my friend?
Introducing: Pens Plus Pals
At its most basic level, Pens Plus Pals aims to provide that same thrill to its Pen-Members by matching pen pals across the world. P+P will tailor a match to suit your correspondence goals, whether you want conversation topics to focus on current events, new perspectives, mentorship, kid-friendly content, spirituality, romance, or let us play P+P ""roulette"" and see what pen pal fate awaits you!
Inclusions, please:
For our Yearly Pen Members, there are also great Pen Perks to receive along the way, including killer stationery sets and pencil case, P+P apparel, and more!
  Upon signing up for P+P, these packs will be (surprise) mailed to our Pen Members along with the reveal of the ""Pen Name"" of the pen pal with whom you've been matched and their address. From there, well, start writing - your exciting P+P experience begins! 
Themed stationery sent every quarter!
We will also provide you with quarterly gift packs filled with ""surprise and delight"" to keep your creative juices flowing.
Special delivery!
Is this for me?
If you're craving an excuse to unplug from our overexposed world of mass posts on Snap-Gram-Insta-Face-Tube, P+P is for you. Don't get me wrong, there’s a ton of value in these platforms but they shouldn’t be a replacement for or at the expense of writing traditions. End your reliance on the backspace button, spend 10 minutes on airplane mode, and let's challenge ourselves to compose thoughts and ideas on paper with the goal of creating authentic connection with fellow human.
The future of P+P
Not only will you take advantage of the great cathartic and health benefits of writing and cultivating a one-on-one relationship with your pen pal, but you'll join a lively community that is challenging modern and conventional wisdom about the place for letter-writing in the world. P+P should endeavor to become the #1 global movement and catalyst for letter exchange. 
With enough groundswell behind Pens Plus Pals, I'd also love to offer a Pen-It-Forward Program that allows Members to sponsor a Pen Pal in homeless shelters / nursing homes and also a P+P School Program for school exchanges, and many other fun products and inclusions in the near future!
What about Ts & Cs?
For anyone concerned about those Terms & Conditions, we got your back. The registration system will include a user verification process, the requirement to select a ""Pen Name"" to protect identities.
If, after those security measures, you'd still like an added layer of anonymity, the Yearly Penultimate Plan offers full anonymity. P+P will protect your identity and location by serving as the shipping go–between for you and your pen pal!
Before you leave...
Are you feeling left behind or increasingly disenchanted in the digitally-dominated world? Are you a parent looking for a fun and educational weekly activity to share with the kids? Do you need a gift for ""the person who has everything""? Bottom line: you belong with Pens Plus Pals if you place an inherent value in writing and honor our three key values: legacy, authenticity, and community.

 "
831,1067166164," Ever dreamed of having underwear for everywhere? Underwear that’s perfect for exploring the world or exploring the great indoors?
Undies that lounge, gym, & swim.
Because what’s the difference?
Why do we need to buy three bra tops for a single day of activities?
Why is it ok to post a picture of yourself in your bikini but not your underwear?
We think underwear should empower you, not limit you…
So we created SOMI: 
The breathable underwear that moves with you...
Because we’re always moving! 
We’re jumping in the pool, or hitting the trail, or getting in a quick yoga session.
And we shouldn’t have to constantly change our undies to fit the occasion.
Or worse, have to skip out on activities because we don’t have a swimsuit, or a sports bra, or a change of underwear.
SOMI Men's Boxer
 SOMI is the three-in-one solution that’s made from a sustainable version of Silk Jersey fabric. It’s breathable, antibacterial, moisture-wicking, quick-drying, supportive, comfortable, and always ready for your next activity. And that’s the way underwear should be!
So you can lounge in comfort at home
  So you’re ready for anything.
  So your bedroom drawers aren’t so crammed.
  So you can jump in the pool without the hassle of changing.
  So you can cool off in that hidden waterhole on your hike.
  So you can be free to focus on what matters.
  So, seriously...what is the difference?
What sets a swimsuit apart from a set of undies?
And what makes SOMI a category apart?
Well, swimsuits are generally made of cheap materials. They aren’t concerned with comfort, they aren’t meant to be worn close to the skin for extended periods of time, and they tend to feature:
Awkward ties, twists, and bumps.
  Loud colors and prints that show through clothing.
  Round strings rather than flat elastic straps.
  Absurdly high price tags (especially for something you only wear a few times a year).
What about traditional underwear? It’s made from delicate, fragile lace that you have to wash carefully, and it’s much easier to tear. Or it’s a five-pack of cotton undies—generic, water-absorbent, and destined to show wear within a few washes.
In the eco-conscious category, you can forget style and sexiness. It’s utilitarian, rugged, and often oddly shapeless.
SOMI bridges this gap with stylish, comfortable, versatile classics made from an eco-friendly fabric that washes like a dream.
 We’ve always loved the idea of minimalism, but we wanted to offer our SOMI wearers the best of everything: The best workout underwear, the best swimwear, the best “I-just-want-to-be-comfortable-and-lounge-around-in-my-undies” wear. But how could we do that while still maintaining an eco-positive, minimalistic approach?
The answer was simple: Create one functional (yet fashionable) set of undies that does it all.
And make it durable enough to last for years to reduce your carbon footprint.
Wear SOMI for your next:
Adventure
SOMI packs small, so throwing a spare pair in your day pack is easy.
  You’ll ALWAY have your swimsuit on you, so if you need to cool off in that hidden waterhole it’s A-okay.
  You won’t need to find a changing area on the trail (save time and stay safe!)
  Stay clean and fresh for longer, even after a long day of kayaking or cycling!
  Workout
Unlike cotton underwear, which traps and logs sweat, SOMI underwear is moisture-wicking and quick drying.
  SOMI’s antibacterial properties are sweat activated to keep you fresh, even after a hard sweat.
  The Betty and The Deep Dive from our tops collection double as sports bras for low impact exercises like yoga, barre, and pilates.
  You can easily transition from lounging on your couch to your home workout.
  Swim
SOMI is UV and chlorine resistant.
  SOMI styles are designed with classic simple cuts that work for the beach, pool, and beyond.
  Save time and jump right in the pool!
  Lounge
Above all, SOMI is comfortable!
  No more wires, no more wedgies, no more sticky, sweaty material.
  Wear underneath your everyday clothing without worrying about panty lines.
  Did you know that fashion is a major contributor to pollution? In fact, 140 million pounds of clothes end up in landfills each year, and 20% of industrial water pollution is estimated to come from garment manufacturing.
We care about the world we live in, so designing SOMI to be eco-friendly and ethically made wasn’t a decision we had to think twice about.
What took a lot longer was coming up with an eco-conscious fabric that offered the water-resistance we needed, combined with the comfort we couldn’t live without.
We partnered with a supplier of some of the best athletic and swimwear brands in the world, and we worked with them to develop a new antibacterial fabric that would hold up even better in the gym and on the road—anywhere you’re likely to sweat.
The result was SustainLuxe: A material comparable to a sustainable version of Silk Jersey in its softness, flexibility, strength, and sheen—yet sustainably made and eco-friendly. And it's even constructed for maximum breathability so you stay comfortable no matter the activity. SustainLuxe is:
Best of all, SustainLuxe:
But we didn’t stop there, because we wanted SOMI to be ethically made as well as eco-friendly. To this end, we’ve taken careful measures to vet all our suppliers to ensure their workers are treated fairly.
SOMI wearers are practical, adventurous, and always ready to sweat—so we knew we had to make SOMI as resilient as they are.
It had to be durable, long-lasting, and ready to stand up to the wear and tear of a life well-lived.
It had to be easy to care for.
And above all, it had to be ready to go at a moment’s notice.
That’s why SOMI is:
Easy to hand wash (just wash in the sink with soap or shampoo, then roll into a towel and squeeze tightly).
  Resilient enough to throw directly into the laundry and dryer.
  Quick-drying, and tough enough to withstand heavy usage.
  All of our Kickstarter designs feature silky, breathable Sustainluxe fabric and are engineered to be supportive for low impact workouts like yoga and pilates. Our four-way stretch movement will keep you feeling comfortable day and night, and you’ll feel fresh for longer with antibacterial properties designed to last for up to 50 washes.
Our bra band and waistband elastic is sourced from a luxury supplier. Since we’re selling directly to you, we can afford to add this expensive detail: It’s thin enough to not add bulk, but thick enough to give you the support you need.
Our favorite part of this elastic is the hand feel. It feels as soft and silky as buttered kittens, and it doesn’t have that super shiny “I’m lingerie!” finish; instead, it’s a subtle sheen that lasts through grueling wash after wash.
To effectively manage resources, we are offering 3 designs at the start of our campaign: The Betty, The Maverick, and The Workout Buddy—all in black. As we hit our stretch goals for funding, more styles and colors will be available. You will pick which styles you want in a post-campaign survey.

We tested SOMI on 243 women, sampled over 100 fabrics, and examined 50 bra band elastics before bringing our venture to Kickstarter. Why? Because we wanted SOMI to be perfect in every way—and we knew the only way to achieve that was by paying attention to the little details, then getting real feedback from the people who matter.
Here’s what they had to say about their SOMI experiences:
With SOMI, we’re creating a new category…
It isn’t swimwear. It isn’t underwear. It isn’t yoga-wear…
It’s all three.
Here’s how SOMI compares to the status quo:
Because our SOMI bra tops are designed with super-stretchy double-lined fabric, we recommend choosing your size based on your band measurement rather than your cup size. If in doubt, size down!
Please note that some styles are only available in certain sizes, so make sure to look at the size availability when picking your preferred look.
It started with an email.
“Hey,” it said. “Can I wear this underwear in the water? Like a bikini?”
At this point, SOMI was just a vision and a website.
We thought about it. What was the difference between underwear and swimwear, really? Our test line was already made from quick-dry fabric with sporty accents.
“We don’t see why not,” we wrote back.
Two days later, she sent a photo wearing her SOMI effortlessly in the water.
Then we got another photo.
And another.
Different women smiling and wearing their underwear proudly for everything from home workouts to hikes.
And there was one hiker who did a week-long trip with only SOMI, wore it as a swimsuit, and washed it in the sink at night.
We realized we were onto something.
Fast-forward to today, and we’ve transformed our flagship line into something never seen before: A whole new category of designs intended to empower and embolden.
We’re more than just a team of dreamers, though. We know how to bring products to market, how to deliver on our promises, and how to execute on manufacturing and production.
So without further ado, meet our people:
 To support our goal of being eco-friendly and sustainable, we are being selective about what we produce and when. 
What we will definitely produce: 
The Betty Bra,
The Maverick bottom, 
The Workout Buddy (Men's Boxer Brief),
All in black color to start with.
What we will produce when we hit specific funding goals:
The Highflyer bottom ($50K),
The Boyshort bottom ($75K),
The Deep dive top ($100K),
The Versatile ($200K),
The Minimalist ($400K),
Additional colors for the entire line: $150K - Mocha, $250K - Navy/Lavender, and at $300K - A new color will be chosen by backers!
A team can dream, right? Here’s what we can add to our SOMI line if we achieve these fundraising landmarks:
This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them."
832,122881390,"The story 
We’ve all seen the disturbing images of the boats, rickety contraptions that hardly look watertight, full to the brim of men, women, and children fleeing war-torn countries. We’ve all seen the galvanizing images of the bodies washed up, floating in the sea, dredged onto the beach. This year alone more than 300,000 people have tried to make the dangerous Mediterranean crossing in pursuit of a better life; up to 2,600 are known to have died. When they arrive in Europe, they face an uncertain future, frequently remaining trapped on the borders as EU governments try to shift responsibility. The numbers keep mounting up. We are in the midst of the worst refugee crisis since World War Two. 
Yet the mainstream political and media environment habitually strips refugees of their humanity, casting them not as people worthy of help – not as people at all – but as a threat to “our way of life”, to our scant resources, a “swarm” seeking to overwhelm our borders. Images matter, but so do words. Over recent weeks we’ve seen a battle over terminology – “migrant crisis” versus “refugee crisis”. The overuse of the term “migrants”, splashed across the headlines of broadsheets and newscasts, is dehumanising, misleading and implies less responsibility for governments. The 1951 UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees defines a refugee as someone who has fled his or her own home country and cannot return because of a well-founded fear of persecution there. In contrast, a migrant is someone who freely chooses to move from one place to another for better socio-economic conditions. 
Our project 
In a bid to offer more insightful coverage of this crisis, Matthew Williams and I, Audrey Courty, would like to spend 3-4 weeks in Europe, travelling along the refugee trail from Turkey to Germany, stopping at key border crossings and refugee camps. We want to produce a short documentary (30-45 minutes) capturing the long, desperate journeys of persecuted people seeking asylum. At the same time, we plan to write stories and record videos that will be published on our website: http://ontherefugeetrail.com [it will go live by Sunday, September 20]. We’ve evaluated that to cover our travel expenses for this project, we need at least $2,500 AUD. Most media outlets nowadays do not have the time and resources to promote this kind of project. But as more refugees continue to travel to Europe, and EU governments remain bitterly divided over what to do, the more urgent we feel these stories are. Even $25 can go a long way in helping us shed a more compassionate light on the refugee crisis.
For more information, please contact Matthew Williams on Twitter @mjwill1991, Audrey Courty @audreycourty, or follow our progress @refugeetrail."

834,913310720,"Adam and Eve Inverted
The Project
The project is two 72 x 46 inch oil paintings of a life sized nude male and female facing the Pacific Ocean. Instead of expressing Adam and Eve's legendary fear and guilt they each stand naturally facing open space. 
The Story
The vision of standing naked and free, and facing open space, light, sand, and sea. No religion, no wars, no stupid products, and no confinements to block our possibilities. This stance rocks my world. It's not that I am anti-business or anti-progress or anything like that, it's just that the spirit of facing the world without those distractions reminds me of our innocence, our humanity, and our hope for living in a special world. And it gives me unbearable pleasure to touch that in paint everyday. 
Rethinking Art History and Keeping It Fresh
It keeps things fresh to rethink art history and try new things, like finding ways to create unique color harmonies for the paintings. By drawing pastels on location I came up with interesting combinations of rusts, blues, aquas, and earth hues. Those pastel studies will play a major part in setting the color theory for the oil paintings and give them a nuance that is unrepeatable. 
Underway
The project is well underway. Alanna Burns and Javier Cervantes are the models. They have already posed for the graphite studies. The are both young artists themselves, sensitive to their surroundings, philosophical, creative, and caring. And as soon as I met them, inspiration to work with them hit home.

Newberry, Man Study, 2012, graphite on Rives BFK, 22 x 16 inches
The Background
A few weeks ago for a couple of days, on the vast California beach of San Onofre, I drew 30 pastels and 6 charcoal landscape backgrounds for this project. Salt, sand, marine layers, sun, currents, and wind influenced the feeling of my mark making. 
Newberry, Rust Blue 3, 2012, pastel on rust-orange paper, 19 x 25 inches
(You can view the 30 plus landscapes rewards here.)
What is Next To Do
Now that all the studies are done, what is left is to pull everything together: two monumental works (life-size figure); twist on art history; unique color combinations; and a theme of facing freedom.
The woman painting is already started and is in a monochromatic stage. The plan is to stretch the man's canvas (Belgium linen) and place it along side the woman. And continue to work them side by side. 
Where You Come In
Optimistically this will take me 3 months working 24/7. The Kickstarter goal of $6,000 is basically to pay for time. Practically all my projects go through to completion but usually take time because I balance finishing them with selling smaller works. This is where you come in. 
Offering smaller works, such as the works above, and selling them all at once makes it much easier to complete major works. It's like having a patron! Please consider a donation that you feel comfortable with, and you will be rewarded with an artwork(s) at a fair value. This will definitely contribute to inverting the legend of Adam and Eve and striking a stance for freedom!

I am currently in the early stages of creating a new website aimed at documenting all the carp venues within the UK. Being a keen carp angler, i am constantly on the look out for a new venue to visit, a little known gem crying out for carp anglers to visit.
I want to create something a little different, something that will allow carp anglers to find new venues to visit but be able to obtain as much information about the venue prior to visit. 
To do this i have created www.getfishing.co.uk and i plan to visit each venue personally, i will speak to the venue owners and find as much information about the lakes as possible (what baits work well, rigs etc. I will also capture aerial photos and create a video promotion of each lake (see example above). This allows anglers to get a full picture of the lake, how it looks and what does best. This is something no other fishing venue directory offers, we don't just pick a picture and give basic information about the venue, we capture what carp anglers look for when visiting a new venue.
At this stage i'd like to point out that i am not doing this for any financial gain. I do not charge any of the venues added to the site nor will i be looking to charge visitors to the site. I am creating this purely for us carp anglers and to give a helping hand to the smaller venues looking for a bit  of help publicising their lakes.
All money raised will be used towards travel costs incurred whilst traveling the UK to document these venues. As mentioned above, i am funding this project myself with no plan of return, however i am struggling to finance the costs of travel, and this fund raising project will go along way to helping me document as many venues as possible.
Hopefully this fund raising project can be a success and allow me to get more done over the next 12 months, either way look out for the site, it will become the go to site for UK carp venues.
We only need 500 of the thousands of carp anglers in the UK to donate £5 to this project to get us up and running. Please help us.
Thank you"

¿Por qué Frontera?
Frontera es una película sobre reducirse para caber en un espacio que ni siquiera te permite respirar. Es sobre permitir que alguien, o algo, te invada tanto que de pronto en ti ya no queda más espacio ni para ti misma.
En nuestro cortometraje buscamos explorar los límites entre las personas, la frontera que existe entre lo racional y lo emocional. Queremos contar una historia sobre sentirse vulnerable y buscar fuerzas dentro de este estado.
Why Frontera?
Frontera is a film about making yourself smaller and smaller in order to fit in a space that does not have room for breathing. It’s about letting someone (or something) invade you so profoundly that, one day, you find yourself not even fitting in you.
In our short film, we explore the boundaries between people, the border between the rational and the emotional. We want to tell a story about feeling vulnerable and making that state a first step in the process of taking your own life back.

Ana Fer, writer-director
No fue hasta tiempo después de haberse mudado a la CDMX se dio cuenta que siempre había querido contar historias y que las películas serían su forma preferida para hacerlo. Ana Fer ve la escritura y la dirección como dos partes del mismo proceso creativo que buscan crear universos donde quepan las historias honestas, complejas, libres y diversas (¡como la vida misma!) al igual que los personajes que habiten esos espacios.
Admira particularmente las películas que hacen sentir, por lo que ama el cine de Mia Hansen-Løve, Michelangelo Antonioni, Chantal Akerman y Eliza Hittman.
Además, ha tenido la oportunidad de formar parte del cuarto de escritoras de una serie universitaria, participar como moderadora en el Festival de Cine Kinoki y trabajar en la redacción de varias publicaciones como Vacant, DNA Magazine e Ibero 90.9, donde también es locutora del programa ‘El Cine y…’ desde el 2018.
It wasn't until years after moving to Mexico City that Ana Fer realized she had always wanted to tell stories and that movies would be her favorite way to do so. She sees writing and directing as two parts of a process that strives to create worlds where honest, complex, and diverse stories (just like life itself!) can exist.
She particularly admires films that make you feel, which is why she loves Mia Hansen-Løve, Michelangelo Antonioni, Chantal Akerman and Eliza Hittman’s work.
Ana Fer has also been a part of a TV show's writers' room, participated as a moderator at Kinoki Film Festival and written for several online and printed publications such as Vacant, DNA Magazine and Ibero 90.9, where she is also a radio presenter of 'El Cine y...' since 2018.

Desde 2016 ha fotografiado más de 10 cortometrajes, tanto de ficción como documentales y dos videos musicales. Para ella, mirar nunca ha sido un acto pasivo.
En su trabajo, crea imágenes que piensan y sienten, deforman y transforman, que reinventan lugares y momentos. Para ella, el movimiento que realmente tiene lugar en las imágenes, no es el que el público percibe al mirar, sino el que se construye en su imaginación. Para encontrar la clave visual de cada proyecto, Renata nunca ha dejado de experimentar con películas, sensores, lentes, color y luz, en sincronía con directores que están intoxicados por las posibilidades de su arte.

838,63530552,"We figured that part of the problem lies in the way we are taught at school. When you think of the way traditional learning works, you often picture something like this:
You go into a classroom and learn from the professor and the material he /she has already set up for you, which makes it difficult for students to draw a connection between the classroom lesson and the real world.
To establish a creative and stimulating environment where undergraduate students can build up their experience and skills using a project-based learning approach. To accomplish this we want to open up our first HackerSpace in Orange County, CA. A place full of resources (Arduinos, 3D printers, computers, tool, etc..) that students can use to creative some innovative and challenging to share with the world!
We want to help students build up their experience and skills and give them something exceptional to share with the world. Having a strong resume and High GPA are great, but having an innovative and challenging project that you can visually showcase or a great achievement you are particularly proud of makes an even greater impact.

We are a group of 4 undergraduate students from California that want to help other students have a better feature. We care about education and believe that it is important for students to use more of a hands on learning approach in order to acquire real knowledge. Over the past 3 months we have worked countless hours to further develop this idea and have reached out to professors and other authorities in the subject (project-based learning and S.T.E.M.) to make sure we are creating the most effective and exciting way for students to learn and stand out from the crowd. Now we need your help to make this project a reality. 
I'm a 22 years old Computer Science major at the University of California, Irvine. I have always been on a journey for the pursuit of knowledge, but I’m aware that regardless of the number of books I read, I will only learn by experiencing things for myself. Ever since I can remember I've been curious about science and technology and recently about art. My experiences and skills range from robotics and project management, to photography. I have been a leader, programmer and engineer contributing to several robotics projects over the past 3 years. What distinguishes me from others is that I can efficiently follow directions and work well in the solitude of my own space and still posses great emotional intelligence which allows me to interact well with others and be a team member.
I'm a student at Irvine Valley college majoring in Communications. I'm passionate about maintaining a healthy lifestyle, exploring new places, making connections with different people and learning through the process of it all. I'm participating in this project because I'm a strong supporter of hands-on learning, and believe that by assuming the role of Public Relations Officer, I can gain more experience in networking and communication.
My name is Tim Gutierrez and I am the director of photography for STEMbility. I’m passionate about music as well as singing. I’m also attending Orange Coast College as a psychology major.

I believe in him as well as what he is trying to achieve with his company.
I am a current UCI student majoring in mathematics. I am passionate about film and storytelling. I am participating in this project because I believe in hands on learning. By getting experience and trying it out, it makes learning fun and comes more naturally.

We want to promote S.T.E.M. education and project-based learning among students all ages. We want YOU to join this movement. So take a picture of yourself working on a project or experiment (Groups photos are welcomed too) and upload it to Instagram or Twitter using the hashtag #readystemgo.

I have been using the same camera equipment for almost 8 years now, and although a photographers images are not based on the equipment he uses, but rather the skill and creativity put into them, my camera is starting to show its age. 
I would love to start shooting more NYC landscapes and personal projects that I come up with. Living in NYC, I love walking around and shooting its great sights and uncanny streets whenever I can. I feel this city always has something to offer, and if you have a little bit of patience and a quick trigger finger, you can capture some amazing moments. I'm looking to shoot more double exposures as well, and incorporate them with my portraits and landscapes in a way that would create some amazing work. 
In helping me fund my brand new camera equipment, I will personally shoot a NYC landscape for you to hang on your wall. The image above was shot by me 2 years ago, and it now hangs in my living room. With your backing, I will create a lovely unique piece of art for you to hang in your home. that will always be a conversation piece and look great in any room.
The rewards will be sent out by September, since I will need time to produce and print the unique work. Rest assured, I will work hard all through the spring / summer season and if the images become available sooner than expected, they will be shipped!. If you have a preference of location in NYC or want an image of a different location other than the NYC skyline: Brooklyn bridge? Flushing queens? Coney Island? Madison Avenue? LET ME KNOW!! I offer the NYC skyline as a starting point, but will cater to almost any request as long as its possible and I have access to the area / angle. As stated, the higher the reward, the more choices you have from the images, e.g. if you ask for an image of Coney Island and pledge the 24x36 I will shoot 3 different images for you to choose from.

There are many websites on the Internet which give a good education, but most of them are boring for the children or too expensive!!!

These questions guided me to an idea to help other parents for free, and with your help we can make the best gaming education web site, which can help children to enjoy learning while they are playing.

Every country has its own education methods and language.
Per example the language in Iraq is Arabic, to write abi in arabic (which means father) you will need to write the following three letters from right to left and you will also need to connect these letters to each other.
And the language in The Netherlands is dutch, and when you write Aap in the netherlands (which mean monkey) you will need to write tow letters Aa (which is double A) and P, but you will need to write it from left to right (like most of the words languages) and as you can see the letters are separated.
To solve this issue, we have decoded to bind every profile to two properties country and school year. This will bind all games to these properties and will lead a fourth class student living in The Netherlands to other games than a fourth class student living in Iraq.
The other big issue is contacting universities, its too expensive and needs a lot of human resources per example by traveling to the countries of these universities. But this will be possible with your help by fonding this project.
Traveling to these countries is too expensive
What is it?
- An open source education gaming platform for all school years, languages and countries.
- Children can learn by playing, this is the best way to get the school lessens inside the children heads without any difficulty.
- Free registration for children, schools and parents
- Universities should participate by contacting them and going to them with the idea.
Who can use it?
- Children in elementary school (at the beginning)
- Parents of these children.
- Schools and class teachers of these children.
- Ministries of education in all the countries in the world.
How it works?
- Every country has its own education methods.
- We contact universities in these countries and ask them for help.
- Universities ask students to make education games as graduate projects.
Open source education platform
- PHP/HTML5 based website
- All games will be open source HTML5 based
- Contact universities to participate per example as a graduate project to there IT students. 
Supported platforms
Registration fees
- No registration fees applies to anyone.
- Anyone can help will be welcomed.
Restrictions
- No porn materials may be added (even education ones).

あらすじ
Due to the Fukushima earthquake and tsunami disaster on 03/11/2011, Yoko lost her husband and her eight year old son Yuta.  For three years she struggles with grief, and one night she hears Yuta’s whisper from a phone booth. She attempts to speak with him... a mysterious sign of life. Yoko wakes up in an unrecognized place, her pursuit begins.
人見洋子は、2011年3月11日、東日本大震災による津波で、夫と8歳の息子・人見裕太の命を奪われてしまい、以後3年間悲しみとの戦いを続けていた。ある晩、公衆電話からの通話で裕太の「囁く」声を耳にし、彼女にとっては摩訶不思議な体験であり、息子と会話をしようとしたが、自分の見知らぬ場所で目を覚まし、そこから彼女の追跡が始まることとなる。

なぜこのストーリー
To write the story of “Whisper”, I was inspired by an article about the ""Wind phone booth"" connected to nothing and nowhere. This phone booth is located outside the Japanese town of Otsuchi.
本作品「囁く」の物語は、岩手県大槌町にある、電話線がどこにも繋がっていない「風の電話」という電話ボックスについての記事にインスピレーションを受けています。
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article by Spooky - Oddytycentral: “Ever since the tragic tsunami of 2011, which claimed nearly 20,000 human lives, thousands of grieving people have visited the booth to “call” their lost loved ones as a way of coping with their loss. The Wind Phone, as the now famous Otsuchi telephone booth is commonly known, was actually built a year before the 2011 tsunami that ravaged Japan’s Tōhoku coast. Otsuchi resident, Itaru Sasaki, had lost his cousin in 2010 and decided to build a phone booth in his hilltop garden from where he would call his dear relative as a way of dealing with grief. He would call his cousin’s phone number on an old, unconnected rotary phone, and his words would be “carried on the wind” as he spoke. Even though no one would talk back to him, it made Sasaki feel a deeper connection to his cousin.In the aftermath of the 2011 earthquake, Itaru Sasaki opened his Wind Phone booth to the public, allowing members of the community to mourn their losses in the same way he had.”
Itaru Sasaki  - “The telephone is not connected, but people feel like their lost loved ones are there listening on the other end of the line. I want people to resume their lives as soon as possible by expressing their feelings.”
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The amazing and emotional story about the ""Wind phone booth,"" inspired me to add some magic in my own script. Besides the grief and struggle in the protagonist's (Yoko's) daily life after her loss of her husband and son, she also experiences hope after she wakes up in an unknown world where she is guided by a mysterious red light.  
Nowadays, there's an abundance of short films and only a few of them are focusing on the feelings, emotions, the magic of making the viewer recognize themselves through the characters and story. These are the main key aspects that I want to focus in this film. 
「風の電話」の感動的な話から受けたインスピレーションは、私が書き始めていた脚本を更に魅力的にしてくれました。この映画の主人公（人見洋子）は、夫と息子を失くしてからの日々の深い悲しみと苦しみだけでなく、不思議な赤い光に導かれて全く見知らぬ場所で目覚めたあとに、希望というものも経験することになります。
近頃では多くの短編映画が作られていますが、感情や感覚、登場人物やストーリーを通して観客が自分自身を見つめさせてくれる映画が持つ魔法、といったことに焦点を当てた作品は数少ないです。この映画では特にそう言ったものを考えながら作りたいと思っています。

ロケーション
Another important aspect of this film is location. 70% of the locations will be exteriors, especially when she wakes up in the unknown world where a red light guides her.  A very important part in a good film is the right choice of the locations: how the atmosphere and colors of the setting is in relationship with the character and her psychological and spiritual state. This is the reason why location scouting is very important as we have some amazing locations in mind that are perfect for our film, but still have to scout for others.
本作品をつくる上でもう一つの重要なポイントは撮影場所です。この作品では、ロケーションの70%（特に主人公の女性が赤い光に導かれて見知らぬ場所で目覚めてから）が屋外になります。良質な映画にはずせないポイントの一つは最適なロケーション選びでしょう。撮影場所の雰囲気や色調と、主人公の女性のキャラクター性や彼女の精神的状態は、密接な関係にあります。だからこそ撮影場所選びはとても重要なのです。今回の映画にぴったり会う素晴らしいロケーション候補は既にいくつか考えてありますが、他の撮影場所も探さなくてはなりません。

845,433410266,"Blessid:  Fate Can Change Your Life Forever 
Rachel Kerbs (Splinter) stars as Sarah Duncliffe in Blessid
 STORY 
We all have free will to make our own choices in this life. But we are never really alone... 
Blessid is a poignant indie drama about a pregnant woman with a cursed past who forms a bond with a man who is immortal. At its core, Blessid is an anti-suicide film whose ultimate message is about self forgiveness. 
Sarah Duncliffe (played by Rachel Kerbs) battles suicidal thoughts and disturbing hallucinations of her deceased sister (a victim of a tragic childhood accident), an abusive ex-boyfriend who continues to stalk her, and the banal existence of an empty marriage. Weeks away from delivering a child that she feels undeserving to parent, Sarah finds her life taking a surprising turn when she accidentally meets her new neighbor who harbors an amazing life secret and shares a personal connection that will change her forever.
Gene Silvers (Edward Duncliffe) and Rachel Kerbs
CAST 
We have an amazing cast of SAG and non-union actors that you've probably seen but may not know by name. Yet. Our talented cast includes:
Rachel Kerbs as Sarah Duncliffe (Splinter)
Rick Montgomery Jr. as Jedediah Cross (Aimy in a Cage)
Gene Silvers as Edward Duncliffe (Law & Order)
Chris DiVecchio as Evan Long (Dark Moon Rising)
Kate Jurdi as Sarah's Mother (Sex Tape)
Gina Pardi as Young Sarah (Crooked Lane)
Madeline O'Brien as Tracy (Gone Baby Gone)
Rachel Kerbs and Rick Montgomery Jr. prepare for a car ride
PRODUCTION TEAM 
In addition to the cast, the real stars of Blessid are the dedicated, professional crew who made this film look amazing … 
Rob Fitz - Director
Bob Heske - Writer/Producer
John E. Seymore - Producer/Actor
Silas Tyler - Cinematography/Editor
Peter Hand Jr. - Gaffer/Key Grip
John Gage - Sound Editor
Federico Chávez Blanco - Composer
Kurt Bergeron - Production Designer
Alanna Keenan - Costume Designer
Alex Ferrari - Color Stylist/Post Supervision (Numb Robot)
For the rest of the cast and crew, visit our IMDB page.
MUSIC 
We've been fortunate to have music from these mega-talented artists on Blessid:
Sarah Blacker
Duke Levine
The Jinxes
WHY SHOULD YOU CONTRIBUTE?
Blessid was shot on the Red Epic and looks amazing. The direction, acting, cinematography, sound mix, music and color correction have all come together to create amazing production quality. Our film literally looks like a million dollar production.
Unlike many projects on Kickstarter, Blessid is an indie film that is complete and will be submitted to film festivals in the coming weeks. 
So why do we need your help? 
As writer/producer of Blessid, I have invested $120,000 of my own money into the film. I believe in it that much. I have also been fortunate to have some other small investors and contributions. But ...
We need more help. 
Now that our film is made, we need to get it out in front of the world. Funds you contribute will be used to help defray costs for film festival submissions, marketing, PR, and additional costs for meeting “Deliverables” requirements. There is no risk that Blessid will be made – it is already on DVD and BluRay screeners. The only risk is that it doesn’t get the marketing support it deserves. 
Your help – in any amount – is greatly appreciated!

Deine Unterstützung fließt somit 1:1 in die Fertigung deiner Produkte! Wir bedanken uns schon jetzt herzlich für deine Unterstützung!

Für wen ist LEiWAND?  
Trail Mountainbiker! Auch bekannt unter All-Mountain- oder Enduro-Biker. Also jeder der sein Bike selbst bergauf tritt und sich dann auf Singletrails runterlässt. Die Abgrenzung sehen wir bei Cross-Country und Downhill, da wir uns bei der Produktentwicklung auf die Anforderungen von Trail Mountainbikern spezialisiert haben. LEiWAND bietet dir europäische premium Sportswear für Trail Mountainbiker zu fairen Preisen.
100% Premium: Funktionalität & Qualitätsmaterialien & Design 
Unter premium Produkten verstehen wir die Kombination von drei Eigenschaften: Erstens, ein funktionelles Design, welches dich beim Up- und Downhill optimal unterstützt. Zweitens, europäische Qualitätsmaterialien, welche den unterschiedlichen Anforderungen beim Trail Mountainbiken gerecht werden. Drittens, eine farbenfrohe, schlichte Designsprache die Freude bereitet.
100% Europa: Faire Produkte Made in Europe 
LEiWAND Produkte bestehen zu 100% aus Europa. Die Produktentwicklung findet in Wien statt. Die Hauptmaterialien kommen von italienischen Lieferanten, das Zubehör aus Europa. Gefertigt wird bei unserem Partner Kirpte in Litauen. Alle unsere Partner und Lieferanten haben sich auf Sporttextilien spezialisiert und haben langjährige Erfahrung in diesem Bereich. Diese findest du im Kapitel „Das LEiWAND Netzwerk“. Wir möchten damit faire soziale und ökologische Bedingungen unterstützen. Außerdem ist es uns wichtig, hiermit ein positives Statement für die europäische Sportbekleidungsindustrie über die gesamte Wertschöpfungskette zu setzen.
100% Direktvertrieb: Faire Preise mit top Preis-/Leistungsverhältnis
LEiWAND Produkte sollen für so viele Mountainbikern wie möglich erschwinglich sein. Beim Kauf unserer Produkte sollst du überzeugt sagen: „Leiwand, da passen Preis und Leistung!“ Daher haben wir uns für ein reines Direktvertriebsmodell entschieden. Unsere Produkte sind nach erfolgreicher Kampagne nur über unseren Online-Shop (www.leiwandwear.eu) zu beziehen. Hierdurch können wir einen Teil der Händlermarge einsparen und dir europäische Premiumprodukte zu fairen Preisen anbieten. Wir bitten dich daher uns bei Kickstarter zu unterstützen, um die Produktion unseres ersten Sortiments zu ermöglichen!

  Unser erstes Sortiment besteht aus der Grundausstattung für Trail Mountainbiker: Shirt, Longsleeve und Short. Die unterschiedlichen Bewegungsabläufe beim Trail Mountainbiken sind die Grundlage der Produktentwicklung. Hierbei kombinieren wir die Anforderungen des bewegungsintensiven Downhills auf Singletrails und dem schweißtreibenden Uphill mit Muskelkraft.
.
Unsere ersten Produkte sind für wärmere Temperaturen ab ca. 18 bis 20 Grad entwickelt. Die Größen und Schnitte sind Unisex, basierend auf Männergrößen. In den Produktbeschreibungen weiter unten findest du Detailinformationen. Unser erstes Sortiment ist produktionsreif und die ersten 600 Stück können nach erfolgreicher Kampagne innerhalb kürzester Zeit hergestellt und ausgeliefert werden. Infos hierzu findest du unter „Projektstatus: Produktionsbereit“.

FUNKTIONALITÄT
Shirt und Longsleeve haben einen Bike spezifischen Schnitt mit verlängertem Rückenteil und genügend Bewegungsfreiheit im Schulterbereich. Die Produkte zeichnen sich durch lockere Paßform mit körperbetontem Schnitt aus. Zusätzlich achten wir bei LEiWAND auch auf funktionelle Details speziell für Biker. Für einen freien Blick durch Brille oder Goggles ist ein Brillenputztuch am Abschluß integriert. Das Longsleeve bietet genügend Platz und Flexibilität um Ellbogenschoner darunter zu tragen. 
MATERIAL
Das spezielle Shirt und Longsleeve Material ist aus Polyester und Elasthan. Es ist leicht, angenehm zu tragen, hoch atmungsaktiv und schnelltrocknend. Ideal für einen schweißtreibenden Uphill bei wärmeren Temperaturen. Der Elasthananteil im 4-Way-Stretch Material garantiert dir optimale Bewegungsfreiheit. Die hohen Abriebswerte des Materials bieten Widerstandskraft beim Tragen eines Rucksacks oder beugen Beschädigung durch Klettverschlüsse vor, genauso wie bei ungewollten Abstiegen vom Bike mit überschaubarer Krafteinwirkung ;)
DESIGN
Das Design ist modern, die Farben sind klar, mit speziellen Designakzenten in Kontrastfarben, die beim Tragen in der Stadt oder auf dem Trail richtig Freude bereiten. Die Farbvarianten pro Produkt reichen von einem optimistischen Orange, klaren und entspannten Blautönen bis zum dezenten, stylischen Schwarz. Die Produkte sind in vier Unisex Größen von Small bis X-Large erhältlich.
.
.
FUNKTIONALITÄT
Die Short hat eine legere Paßform und der Schnitt ist optimal auf die Anforderungen und Bewegungsabläufe des Trail Mountainbikens abgestimmt. Der Bund ist hinten höher geschnitten, bietet damit Schutz vor entblößtem Rücken beim bergauf Radeln. Die Schrittlänge ist vorne kürzer gehalten, damit du nicht an deinem Sattel hängen bleibst. Mit der Weitenverstellung am Bund, kannst du die Hose perfekt an deinen Körper anpassen. Der Kniebereich ist vorgeformt und bietet genügend Platz für Knieschoner. Auch der Hosenlänge und Beininnenweite haben wir bei der Schnittentwicklung besondere Beachtung geschenkt, speziell beim Tragen von Knieschonern ein Pluspunkt. Zwei offene Eingriffstaschen bieten dir bequem Platz um schnell etwas einzustecken. Zum sicheren Verstauen während der Fahrt, gibt es zwei verschließbare Zip-Taschen. Eine kleinere Zip-Tasche befindet sich an der linken Eingriffstasche und bietet Platz für Liftkarte, Bankkarte oder deinen Schlüssel. Am rechten Oberschenkel befindet sich eine Zip-Tasche für größeren Platzbedarf, mit extra Innentasche für dein Smartphone. Die Zip-Tasche ist so konzipiert, dass sie deine Kniefreiheit beim Fahren nicht beeinträchtigt.    
MATERIAL
Das Hosenmaterial ist für wärmere Temperaturen ausgelegt. Es ist sehr leicht, mit hohem Tragekomfort, atmungsaktiv und schnelltrocknend. Der 4-Way-Strech bietet hohe Flexibilität, die Short macht jede Bewegung mit. Zudem weist der Stoff eine hohe Widerstandskraft auf, auch über die Nahtführung erreichen wir ein optimales Verhältnis zwischen Dehnung und Stabilität. Dadurch unterstützt dich die Hose beim bewegungsintensiven Downhill am Trail, als auch bei Tragepassagen mit hohen Stufen und Ausfallschritten.
DESIGN
Das Design der Shorts ist clean und mit allen funktionellen Details ausgestattet. Die Short ist in zwei Farbvarianten, einem urbanen blau und einem stylischem schwarz, sowie in vier Größen von Small – XLarge erhältlich.

The moment after a downhill with your friends on your hometrails and you think: AWESOME! In Vienna we have a special word for this feeling: LEIWAND! For us there is nothing better than biking from the city center of Vienna to the local mountains to enjoy time with our friends on our hometrails. Naturally with a Kracherl, coffee, beer and Spritzwein. We are mountain bikers from Vienna and we have an aim: Offer European premium sportswear at fair prices for trail mountain bikers who demand high quality.  

What makes LEiWAND special? It is the combination of three characteristics!

100% Premium // Functionality & Quality materials & Design  
100% Europe // Fair products Made in Europe  
100% Direct sales // Fair prices with a top price-/performance ratio 
Our team consists of passionate mountain bikers. We have deep and long working experience in the areas of functional sportswear design, graphics, management, marketing and photography. All of us live, work and bike in and around Vienna!  

LEiWAND – European Trail Wear has a clear vision for a sustainable development. For starting the production, we need just one more thing: Your support! Starting the production? Yes, our products are completely developed and tested. We can start with the production of the first 600 products immediately after the campaign with our production partner Kirpte Sportswear. Your financial support will be used 1:1 for the final production of your products! Thank you very much for your support!
.

For whom is LEiWAND made?  
Trail Mountainbiker! Also known as All-Mountain or Enduro-Biker. So everybody who pedals up his bike and rocks on singletrails to the bottom of the mountain. We define the “borderline” at Cross-Country and Downhill riding, as we focus our product development on trail mountainbiking. LEiWAND offers you European premium sportswear for trail mountain bikers at fair prices.

100% Premium: Functionality & Quality Materials & Design   
Premium means for us the combination of three characteristics. First, a functional design that supports you optimally at the up- and downhill. Second, European quality materials, which meet the different requirements of trail mountainbiking. Third, a colorful, discreet design that makes fun.  

100% Europe: Fair products Made in Europe  
LEiWAND products are 100% European. Product development comes from Vienna. The main materials come from Italy, accessories from all over Europe. The production lies with our partner Kirpte in Lithuania. All our partners and suppliers are specialized in sportswear and have long lasting experience in this area. You can find them in the chapter “The LEiWAND Network”. Thereby, we want to support fair social and ecological conditions and make a positive statement for the European sportswear industry throughout the entire supply chain.  

100% Direct sales: Fair prices with a top price-/performance ratio LEiWAND products should be affordable for as many mountain bikers as possible. After you buy our products you should state, „Great, price and performance match!“ Therefore, we use a purely direct sales model. After a successful campaign our products will be available only through our own online-shop (www.leiwandwear.eu). Thereby, we can partially save on the dealer margin and offer you European premium products at fair prices. Please support us on Kickstarter, so that we can start the production of our first product range.
.

  Our first collection offers the basic equipment of a trail mountain biker: Shirt, Longsleeve and Short. The different movements during trail mountain biking are the basis of product development. Hereby, we combine the requirements of the motion-intensive downhill on singletrails and the exhausting uphill by pedalling up the mountain. The two tops have four colour options each, the short has two colour options. All products are available in four sizes from Small to XLarge.



Our first products are made for warmer temperatures starting around 18 to 20 degrees. Sizes and cut are unisex, based on men’s sizes. In the product description below you find information in more detail. Our first collection is ready for production and the first 600 pieces will be produced immediately after the campaign and will be shipped to you within a very short period. For more information regarding the production plan see the chapter on “Project status: Ready for production”.
.
  .
FUNCTIONALITY
Shirt and Longsleeve have a bike specific cut with an extended back part and enough free moving space in the shoulder area. The products have a casual fit with a form-fitting cut. At LEiWAND we pay attention to functional details for trail bikers. For a clear view through your glasses, we added a glass wipe into the tops. The Longsleeve offers enough place and flexibility to wear elbow protections underneath.  

MATERIAL
The special Shirt and Longsleeve material is out of polyester and elastane. It is light, comfortable to wear, highly breathable and fast drying. Ideal for a sweaty uphill in warmer conditions. The elastane in the 4-Way-Stretch material guarantees optimal free moving space and flexibility. The high abrasion resistance offers to prevent damage from wearing a backpack or Velcro strips, also in case of unwanted descents off the bike with a manageable amount of force ;)  

DESIGN
The design is contemporary, the colours are clear with special design accents in contrast colours, so that wearing the tops on the trail and in the city is fun. The four colour variants of the products start from an optimistic orange, to clear and relaxed shades of blue and a discreet, stylish black. The products have four unisex sizes from Small to XLarge.  
.


FUNCTIONALITY
The shorts have a casual fit and are designed for the requirements and movements of trail mountain biking. The back waistband is higher and offers protection against a bare back during pedalling up the mountain. The front inseam is shorter, so that you do not catch the saddle during riding. With the waist adjustment, you can fit the short perfectly to your body. The knee is preformed and offers enough space for knee protectors. We also focused on the shorts length and inner width that is a plus for riding with knee protectors. Two open pockets offer you the possibility to insert something quickly. For a safe pocketing during your ride, there are two zip-pockets. A smaller one is next to the left open pocket and offers you place for cards or your keys. On the right thigh is the larger zip-pocket for more space demand, with an extra inner pocket for your smartphone. This zip-pocket is designed not to disturb your free movement at the knee area while riding.  

MATERIAL
The shorts’ material is for warmer temperatures. The fabric has a high wearing comfort, is light, breathable and fast drying. The 4-Way-Stretch of the material offers you high flexibility. The shorts make every move and offer high abrasion resistance. Through the seam guide, we enable an optimized ratio between flexibility and stability. Thereby, the shorts support you during the motion-intensive downhill on the trail and on carrying passages with high steps and sidesteps.  

DESIGN
The design of the shorts is clean and equipped with functional details. You can choose between two colours, an urban blue and a stylish black, and between four sizes from Small to XLarge.

A transparent supply chain is important for us and we are proud that our network is 100% based in Europe. We want to highlight our production partner Kirpte Sportswear! Kirpte is not only a high quality factory for sportswear, but also gives major input for product development. Thanks a lot to all of our partners and suppliers!

Kickstarter offers us the chance to start our project and a long-term, self-financed and sustainable development. We have a clear plan for additional products for the future, which will be available only through our online – shop (www.leiwandwear.eu).

They are often preferred by cosplayers and theater costumers for quick-change capabilities and for the fact that they look more realistic than a morph suit. Unlike gloves, they don't slide down, and they come with nails for a natural appearance.
Our Arm Socks are unlike any other, we have invisible zippers in our wrists! Perfect for eating and quickly answering your phone. Not to mention, we make Toe Socks to match, so open-toed shoes are no longer an issue when it comes to the illusion of body paint! We plan to custom-dye tights ranging in sizes XS - 8XL and provide colors that match fan-favorite characters and body-paints. Perfect for cosplay, drag, street-fashion, and more! Our initial range of colors will be Snow White, Sakura Pink, Alternia Grey, Lunar Blue, and Wisteria Purple. If we reach our stretch goal of $3500, we'll add Wasabi Green

 The first is the APP for the smart phones. This is a little complicated but not impossible.
 The second is for the web site so that the game can be monitored from a computer. 
 The third is for a new laptop to monitor the games.
 Each game will last about 2.5 hrs, there is a fee to participate. However the game runs on a point system so there are prizes for first, second and third place.
 There is nothing like it in the world so I can not give away any more info on the details.  I have talked to numerous people here in Lethbridge about this idea and about 80% say they like it and would try it, 10%-15% say the would not, and about 5%-10% think it is a foolish idea.

The Current Sessions is a new contemporary dance series which showcases works-in-progress from emerging choreographers in their twenties.
The Current Sessions was conceived in July 2011 to bring like-minded contemporary choreographers together and present work that is in-the-moment and reflective of our current state of mind and process. To this end, all works are created and presented within a time period of six weeks. We are interested in producing detailed works that are fresh, raw, experimental and curious; we want to provide our audience with a glimpse of what dance is right now, and with what dance will be in its future state.
The founding choreographers of The Current Sessions are Genna Baroni, Allison Jones, Yarden Raz, Jonathan Windham, Yin Yue and Alexis Convento. We are all conservatory-trained graduates of schools including SUNY Purchase, Ailey/Fordham, NYU and UArts, and currently dance with companies such as Gallim Dance, Shannon Gillen & Guests and the Metropolitan Opera Ballet, among others. We all have the desire to develop our own voices as choreographers in a comfortable environment where spontaneity, openness and the instinctive nature of creation are valued.
This edition of The Current Sessions will include work from the ""originals"" Alexis Convento, Yin Yue, Jonathan Royse Windham, Allison Jones and Genna Baroni, as well as, a new slew of like-minded individuals such as: Jenna Otter, Jordan Isadore, Benny Royce Royon, and MADboots dance/Jonathan Campbell... how exciting!

These ornaments had history and a special meaning to them. We still hang these ornaments, that are carefully packed away each year, and I share their history with my children. I want to bring back the special ornaments, hanging on the tree, and the tradition that comes with them.
I love to make ceramic and porcelian ornaments, where I pour the slip into the mold. Clean and hand paint each one and then fire them in a kiln, creating a finished piece of artwork. Each piece is slightly different from the other and can be personalized for the buyer.
I have been making ceramic items since I was 12 years old (35 yrs) and made porcelian dolls, later into my adult life. I wish to return to this artistic endeavor, now that I am on permanent disability. I would feel honored to create an item that is cherished by a family and passed down to future generations.
In order to be able to pursue this, I would require the materials and equipment. This includes a kiln, ceramic and porcelian slip and molds. Paints, brushes, pouring tables, drying rack, painting and finishing furniture. Glass pieces and firing stands as well as the miscellaneous equipment to complete these projects. I am asking for your backing on this endeavor and hope I will be able to provide people with cherished items."

Where did the idea of the movie come from ?
  The idea of this movie is to create something the people like to see and for it to have a little bit of everything. The majority of people like seeing movies about police, corruption and laws and others like seeing movies about viruses, epidemics or about the end of the world, so I decided to write a movie where there's a little of both
When will the production start?

La idea de la película fue crear algo que a la gente le guste ver y que tenga un poco de todo, a la mayoría de la gente le gusta ver películas de policías, corrupcion y leyes y a otras les gustan las películas de virus, epidemias o del fin del mundo.
Así que decidi escribir una película donde hubiera un poco de los dos.

This particular kickstarter is for the Irish indie feature film 'Ellie' which was just a logline in a word document several months ago but since then the script has been developed, drafted and re-drafted and re-drafted again. We also held auditions in December in which we cast the five main roles to five brilliant actors and we've also been putting together a talented crew to help bring this film to life! So what's different about this film and this filmmaking group?
We are a young multinational independent film group that will be offering feature films for low-prices in high quantity.
This is an Irish film that appeals in many ways to young adults of modern Ireland
10-15% of what is made from distribution of this movie in spring 2016 will be given to charity and we plan in the long-term to develop in to an intrinsically altruistic movie production company
Of course I'll be funding this film project as much as I possibly can myself but there's only so much that we can afford so far in terms of equipment, set design and the likes. There are many other costly expenses to factor in such as insurance and editing costs. With a successful kickstarter campaign we will be able to complete this film far more effectively and produce a better product for viewers to enjoy afterwards. Here's how funds would be distributed; 
Most of the funding would go towards equipment. We'd focus such funds on improving sound equipment, lighting & upgrading our tripod as well as maximizing filming efficiency by purchasing more SD cards to assure more memory. 
It's important to note that when you make a 'pledge' no money goes through until (and if) the kickstarter succeeds, hence the term pledge. Finally when the film is available for online distribution in Spring of next year, we will be selling it for quite a low price (of about €2 - €3) and we will also probably offer a rental choice that will be even less in cost to offer some variation & choice for each viewer.
*Disclaimer; Pie-chart distribution may be subject to variations if certain expenses become higher than expected. Also in regards to the promotion of media projects in exchange for funding listed under the 'pledge €10' section, any projects which incite discrimination or promotes violence will not be considered. Finally for sending rewards such as the clapperboard reward included in the €500 pledge, posting costs will be paid by us although travel expenses cannot be covered to come to the private screening or come on set as listed in some of the pledges.

Last fall I was honored to be approached by Lynn Nachbar from The Edge Center for the Arts and invited to have a solo exhibition at The Edge gallery. 
The Edge Center for the Arts
The solo exhibition is an important step in any artist's professional development and artistic career. I'm excited to have this opportunity to reach a new audience and show an extensive selection of my work from the past four+ years in such a beautiful gallery. The size of the gallery and scope of the show, however, make the endeavor financially daunting.
I'll need 30-40 framed pieces to mount a satisfactory show in this space. I've already created the work. Now I need to pay to print and frame the majority of these pieces. 
This shows the layout and size of the gallery:
Gallery Layout & Dimensions
My $3,000 project goal will provide $100/piece for 30 pieces. This is a modest amount but will still be enormously helpful.
Making my stretch goal of $5,000 will allow me to produce additional pieces, travel costs to deliver the work and attend the opening reception, and pay the artist.
The following slideshow gives a better sense of the bodies of work and individual pieces I hope to include in the show. These are also the images available for reward selections. Once the project is funded, I'll send backers a link to access an online gallery for better viewing/selection.
To see more of my work or learn more about me, please visit my website: www.terrarathai.com or check out my photo blog: avantgarden365. The blog is where I got my start exploring photography. It's also the best place to see a diverse selection of my pictures and read a bit of my writing, too.  While the blog has been in hibernation of late, I'll be breathing new life into it in the near future. If you like what you see, please subscribe to receive future updates.
Thanks for taking the time to check out my project."

We have been invited by our Hawaiian kumu (teacher) Lani Girl Kaleiki-Ahlo to be a part of the opening night performance at the 2014 Merrie Monarch Festival. Folks in the hula community consider this event the ""Olympics"" of hula. Even though we're not competing, just stepping on that stage to perform is enough to give us major butterflies! We've been practicing our dances, learning to chant in Hawaiian, making costumes, and convincing our spouses and families it really is a good idea!
Now we are looking for funding to help us on our way. The money we raise will pay for new costumes, live musicians, and fresh floral lei and hairpieces."

She&Her Productions bring artist of all mediums together producing in unusual artistic locations. Yes, there are many theater companies in Kansas City but we offer something different. We are a theater company that wants to provide added enticement and uniqueness to our patrons.
Our new home is the Crane Building located in the West Bottoms, which adds even more to the personality of our Theatre company. The space is amazing! However, not a traditional theatre.. yet! So we need your help by pledging a buck or two our way to help us renovate and rejuvenate this old building!
Each production we do will have some type of artist collaborations. All aspects of the arts will be defined, if not explored. We want to not only provide our patrons with an excellent theater show, but a cultivated evening of all the artistic medias. There will always be refreshments after each show free of charge which is an added bonus compared to sold items at intermission like other theaters in and around Kansas City.
Our big difference that we will bring to our patrons is the ticket prices. We want everyone in the community to be able to see great theater and become apart of the huge arts community that Kansas city has to offer, not only the people who can afford to pay top dollar for ticket prices. Our tickets are discounted for adults compared to other theater companies and even more of a discount for students.
We have an extremely exciting line up for the rest of the 2010 year! Plan on marking your calendars to see our Fall musical, October 15, 16, 18, 22, 23 and 24th. We will be ending 2010 with a holiday comedy by Jeff Goode; The Eight: Reindeer Monologues!
We are planing a HUGE New Years event at the new space with lots of entertainment and festivities!!!
All that being said, we would be extremely grateful for any cash donation to get our theater company up and running. Thank you for your time and hopefully you agree with our vision and hopes for the future of theatre in Kansas City."
865,1207648341,"If the dime store is a metaphor for the everyday, the ordinary, the well-known neighborhood, or the well-worn path, then Dime Store Red is the anti-routine and the rejection of following suit.  But the immersive exhibit is more tangible than it is conceptual, something best understood and seen at scale.  We are Dime Store Red. We are an immersive installation show. Think massive spaces, assembled structures built from the ground up, and space to meander. We are far from the boundaries of your conventional gallery walls. We want to bring the viewer into, around, and through art. Dime Store Red will offer an immersive experience, emphasized through smart, cohesive design, involving highly interactive installations. We want to invite people into a space where there is freedom to feel, think, and process.  We have a passion for redefining boundaries in how people interact within a curated space. We want to design, play, and then push past those boundaries using color, shape, space, and light. We are Dime Store Red. A vibrant residency pop-up experience that pushes past what is expected.  




Juliana “JULU” Lupacchino. Born and Raised in Savannah, Ga. Juliana earned her degree in Fibers from the Savannah College of Art and Design in 2017. She is now a full time freelance artist. Her passion within the arts lies in color, and the infinite ways colors react. Her brand JULU, cultivates the idea that JULU can be a verb, noun, or adjective. JULU is a word that celebrates color, design, and people. Her iconic JULU pattern has been covered items from public walls, stairwells, and shipping containers, to more utilitarian items such as upholstery furniture, roller blades, and pillows.  Anything can be JULU'ed, if the passion and excitement is there. 
William “WILLKES” Kesling. Born and Raised in LaPorte, Indiana. William earned his degree in Graphic design from the Savannah College of Art and Design in 2016. William is a dynamic digital and sound artist that forayed into visual arts first through his conceptual photography. William is passionate about collaborative projects, especially in the fields of music and film. He is passionate about design in a multitude of ways, ranging from digital design, to exploring work that can be tangible. 




For an audience, art is about fluid boundaries, interaction and perception, and even self-fulfillment. For the artist, it is dually an intensely personal statement and a study on something bigger than the self. Dime Store Red is an immersive installation experience that amplifies interpretations on both.
Four years in the making, Dime Store Red is the creative undertaking of Juliana “JULU” Lupacchino and William “WILLKES” Kesling, two emerging artists in Savannah, Georgia. Juliana and William met in school at SCAD and began dreaming and creating, culminating most recently in an early 2019 mixed media collaboration. JULU is known for painting beloved large scale lilting patterns, while WILLKES is a dynamic digital and sound artist that forayed into visual arts first through his conceptual photography. As the two assess their post-college life and trajectory, Dime Store Red is the groundswell culmination of their tandem creative energy and motivations for the road ahead.
With consumable art aplenty in Savannah, the artists wanted to bring a different experience about, something that would push boundaries: for viewership and interacting with a space, for interpreting next-scale art, for art accessibility for all, and for the inherent self-imposed creative limitations we all face down.
But it turns out that funding the collaborative planning, build-out, and dressing of four large, colorful, mixed-media, multi-dimensional spaces is its own unique challenge. The artists began with the intention of self-funding the show, which runs for 9 days from November 14 to 22. But as it has grown with their imagination and commitment to the unrestrained, so too have the costs. JULU and WILLKES are now gratefully leaning on the people to help crowdfund Dime Store Red and giving everyday people the chance to be part of something beyond.




The pop-up residency consists of sculpture, paint, mixed media, photography, multimedia, adorned ephemera, and a 1000 square foot pop-up installation that sits at the backside of a 22,000 square foot warehouse on Savannah’s westside—a corner of Savannah that doesn’t see many art installations. The warehouse is located directly behind Southbound Brewery, and is less than a five minute drive from the heart of downtown Savannah. The location itself plays a key role in the impact Dime Store Red hopes to infuse into Savannah.  Dime Store Red is the artists’ commitment to creating and sharing art in unrestrained ways.




Jules and Will here. Two artists that like to make things - really crazy things - things that are tangible, massive, and unexpected. We like to bounce ideas for hours, and we don't like to say no to what can be created.  Not only do we want to explore our creativity as much as possible, but we believe anyone can be creative, and we want to push that inside others. We want to build things, and inspire people to do the same. We are doing that through moonshot projects- like Dime Store Red. 
You could call us crazy. We feel like we are a little of that too. And that's 100% a win. 
But we are also passionate creative thinkers, who obsess over saying yes to what can be thought up and created. 



We celebrate dynamic design, adventurous color, and rebellious spirit through experience driven and thought provoking work. We aim to creatively express ourselves through large-scale tangible work. Our passion is to explore with audacity, play with risks, and explore and re-define boundaries. Our hope is that our work inspires, both through the feelings we stir, and the reactions that take place.








The installation will consist of sculpture, paint, mixed media, photography, multimedia, adorned ephemera, and a 1000 square foot pop-up installation that sits at the backside of a 22,000 square foot warehouse. Our attention to intention, is a driving force behind the entire experience of the show. Consider your first glance at the warehouse as the beginning of the experience.  The installation itself will be placed intentionally in the back of the warehouse. The viewer will walk through the warehouse and eventually reach the installation.  Once the viewer has entered the installation, they will be able to walk through three rooms. Each room revolving around it's own concept and design. We are submerging people into one experience after another.

SONS & DAUGHTERS OF THE EARTH, Track 1. Full text as heard in video:
""Partially hidden away on a residential street in Echo Park in California, nestled behind another home at an unnamed ½ address on Lake Shore Ave., at the bottom of a steeply graded empty lot where coyotes graze at night, there is a house growing from the side of a giant avocado tree. And in this tree house there once lived the “cult”—though more accurately described as a family—known as The Sons and Daughters of The Earth. They were a mix-up of 100 different species at least, consisting of the basics, such as your dogs, your cats, your turtles, your squirrels, your birds, etc., along with the more exotic types, such as your lions, your sex panthers(they do exist), your monkeys, your koalas, a single wolf that was said to be domesticated, and they were all men and women too(save for that bastard wolf) who lived together as a family until just two weeks ago to the day when they met their bizarre and untimely deaths.
""The house is no longer occupied by anything representative of a family. Those who have heard rumors of the demise of The Sons and Daughters of The Earth and have ventured into the neighborhood to attempt a glance at the place where they once lived have failed terribly at this because they cannot get through. The property is sanctioned off by investigators who at this moment still haunt the grounds, looking through every nook and cranny of the home in search of some sort of tangible clue as to why, some sort of logical explanation for their extraordinary rise and sudden fall.
""There is only one surviving member of the cult, a small man with pale skin and olive-toned features who is widely associated with a lean bear cub. He has agreed to talk to me, giving me exclusive rights to the story of The Sons and Daughters of The Earth, under the sole condition that the names of all Sons and all Daughters be changed. He will be referred to here under the assumed name of “Avonaco.”
""From the hospital bed where Avonaco lays with his cheeks sunken in and bags under his eyes, bandages running the length of each forearm—spotted in places with drops of dried blood, the red seeming all the darker in contrast to the sterile bandages, his white cotton hospital gown, and the spectacularly white surroundings of the hospital itself—he recounts to me in full the story that will soon be paraphrased. I sit across from him in a wicker chair that looks as though it were out of a WWII mental ward, and I listen intently with one leg crossed over the other as my little recording device sits on the end table beside me.
""The hospital staff has been kind enough to allow me several extended visits to Avonaco in this fashion. I would like to take the time to thank them all now for their endless discretion and hospitality(excuse me), especially D., who provides countless cups of tea which she serves to us on a charming silver tray without saying so much as a single word while my interviews are in session.
""The windows are always pushed open in the hospital room. Outside there is always a warm breeze blowing eerily through palm leaves. Due to the mental state of the patient in question—whose glazed eyes give away that he is obviously still in shock—and the maddening sound of the rustling palm leaves, it is likely that his tale is woven with exaggerations, distortions, and perhaps even the occasional outright falsehood, creating something closer to a caricature of the cult, rather than a snapshot.
""It is not my responsibility to discover the actuality of any mentioned occurrences—leave that to the baffled investigators; it is only my responsibility to record the truth as it is told to me through poor, mangled Avonaco and as history will come to recognize it. No matter with what amount of certainty I have in the truthfulness of these occurrences I am to record, I share them with a clear conscience because they will always and forever—as everything is, regardless—be open to speculation.""

870,533929913,"   The Epiphany Rover will be an innovative vehicle designed and manufactured with the intent of competing in the NASA Human Exploration Rover Challenge. The ambitions of this design will be to create a rover which will carry two riders and overcome the harsh terrain, and environment of an extraterrestrial environment. The Epiphany Rover is designed to be as light as possible due to the cost of transporting items off our planet. This will be accomplished by using carbon fiber throughout much of the structure and also in as many components as possible. The rover will consist of a three wheel design, a unique inboard suspension, and a drive train using internal gear hub systems. The wheels used on the rover will also be a unique design. They will be non-pneumatic, and consist of non-commercial specialized polymers to create a tread that will propel the Epiphany across NASA's course. The Epiphany’s wheels will be constructed from carbon fiber and will use clever engineering to allow for the wheels themselves to be modular.
     As part of the parameters for NASA's competition the rover itself will also need to fit into a 5 foot cubic box, which will require some creative ingenuity to design a method for the rover to fold into a storage configuration. The suspension will be completely independent and will be adaptable to the terrain through driver controls. This will allow for the Epiphany to succeed throughout a wide range of the terrain challenges presented by NASA. 
Overall the design of the Epiphany rover will allow for a faster, lighter, and more dependable vehicle to move two riders across a wide range of terrains no matter what planet it is tested on.

874,808232400,"Hello we are Lucia and Konstantina, we are independent choreographers and the founders and producers of the Kaleidoscopic Arts Platform.
Kaleidoscopic Arts Platform is a London-based performance event that celebrates and promotes contemporary dance works by female choreographers. We have so far produced three successful events in London where we have brought dance performance to unconventional spaces for dance, for example a former factory space and a typical East London pub. We have invested our own money and have won the Ideas Tap Innovators Fund for start up businesses in the arts.
We are thrilled to now introduce you to the 4th Kaleidoscopic Arts Platform as part of the Wandsworth Fringe Festival 2017. It will take place on the 19th of May, this time at Wilditch Community Centre, a typical community hall and we aim to make dance performance accessible to the local community of Wandsworth.
This time round, we will be showcasing work by Helen Cox, Jayne Port, Lucidez Dance and Feet Off The Ground Dance. We will also be exhibiting a photography exhibition curated and co-created by Elisabeth Schilling.
It is our mission to support emerging female choreographers in making and promoting their work as well as making it accessible to a diverse audience. We respond in this way to the issue that the current UK contemporary dance scene is dominated, not in quality and quantity, but in publicity and popularity, by male choreographers.
Taking place in spaces not usually intended for dance we bring contemporary dance closer to audiences who are new to dance. A post performance discussion enables the audience to gain an insight into the creative process and the artists to get valuable feedback on their works.
We have been awarded with £2,000 from Wandsworth Arts Council which cover part of the production costs. We now need your help to cover the remaining costs. Your money will allow us pay the artists a fair fee and most importantly it will enable us to tap into further funding so we can continue our work in the long term. The more money we can fundraise through this crowdfunder, the more we will be able to tap into and the better we can support choreographers!
Producing a live performance is very expensive, because it includes paying many hours of rehearsal space, collaborators, music, costumes, and fair fees for your dancers. It is very important to us to be able to pay our artists because non-paid work is a real issue in the dance industry. You can help us make this possible, by making a contribution to this project. To thank you for your contribution, we have have thought up some lovely rewards, which you can see below. Go on, have a read and take your pick!

875,2118113967,"The Flutter of an Eyelid  is a vicious, and often quite funny, satire of Southern California's bohemian community in the 1920s by Jewish-American novelist Myron Brinig (1896–1991). The original edition, published in 1933 and out of print since, was illustrated by Lynd Ward (1905–1985), widely regarded as the ""father of the graphic novel."" I received permission from Ward's estate to reproduce the 38 woodcut illustrations in this new edition. The original edition of the book is very rare and, as of this writing, the only copy available for sale online is going for $649.99.
Some of the novel's characters are loosely based on prominent residents of the Los Angeles neighborhood of Echo Park, an early center of film-making on the West Coast. These include the rare book dealer Jake Zeitlin (1902–1987), whose shop became a gathering place for local writers and artists, and who introduced Brinig to his circle of friends; and the charismatic evangelist and media celebrity Aimee Semple McPherson (1890–1944). 
Zeitlin, who was caricatured as a self-loathing Jewish antique dealer in the novel, considered the book an ""insulting betrayal"" and, after seeing an early set of galleys, threatened to sue. He succeeded in having some of its more offensive anti-Semitic passages removed prior to its publication. Jewish himself, Brinig was no anti-Semite; he and Zeitlin simply did not get along. One source reports that shortly after the book was released, it was pulled from stores because of further legal threats from McPherson and some of the other individuals who were too ""thinly disguised"" in the novel.

""Brinig's novel is the great modernist fantasy of Los Angeles . . . although it is essentially unread today.""
— David L. Ulin, Los Angeles Times, March 14, 2011
""A most unusual book—one that is wholly mad in places, savage and caustic in other places, and here and there set off with a wild and moving beauty.""
— Bruce Catton, Newspaper Enterprise Association, October 12, 1933
""No American author has done anything quite like it, and at first glance one scarcely knows quite what to make of it. . . . A brilliantly bizarre tale, a sort of literary nightmare, quite fascinating through its very strangeness.""
— Galveston Daily News, October 8, 1933
""It is both realistic and romantic, poetic and prosaic, ironical and beautiful, satirical and naive—but always decadent.""
— The (Raleigh) News & Observer, October 22, 1933
""The strangest novel to come out of the territory . . . a novel not set in Hollywood or dealing with the making of movies, but saturated with every fantasy and dream associated with the region.""
— David Fine, Imagining Los Angeles: A City in Fiction, 2000
DESCRIPTION FROM THE ORIGINAL EDITION'S DUST JACKET
""Here a fine novelist turns the circus of California life inside out in a novel which is brilliant, incisive, distinguished—and perverse. His people are so exotic, so extraordinary, that at first they seem unreal—yet they can be recognized as the natural outgrowth of the abnormal conditions under which they live. A new Messiah walks on the waters for the news reels; nudists dance in the moonlight for the Mayor of the city; a woman with a fondness for murdering her men experiments on her latest lover with a delightful new poison; a man kills himself because he has had every other thrill; a Bostonian forgets Boston for a mad moment.""
(Note: I'm not sure that whoever wrote this description actually read the book since the character who ""has had every other thrill"" does not kill himself.)

ABOUT MYRON BRINIG
Myron Brinig was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on December 22, 1896, one of nine children of Romanian immigrants Moses and Rebecca (Labovitz) Brinig. When he was three, his family settled in Butte, Montana, then a booming copper-mining town, where his father opened a dry goods store. Brinig left Butte at the age of 17 to study at New York University and attended lectures on writing taught by the poet Joyce Kilmer. His education, however, was interrupted in 1917 by World War I. After two years in the Army, Brinig returned to New York City where he began his literary career writing short stories for magazines and reading novels for film studios in search of potential movie material.
Brinig's first novel, Madonna Without Child, was published in 1929 by Doubleday, Doran & Company. That same year, his editor John Farrar, along with brothers Stanley and Frederick Rinehart, formed Farrar & Rinehart, and published Brinig's second novel, Singermann, a semi-autobiographical novel of a Jewish immigrant peddler's family in the early 1900's American frontier. The novel is notable in that it is one of the earliest instances in American literature of a gay protagonist whose character is portrayed in a compassionate, non-stigmatizing manner.

Earl Ganz, author of The Taos Truth Game, a fictionalized account of Brinig's involvement with the famous New Mexico art colony of the 1930s, wrote: “A homosexual himself, [Brinig] remained publicly closeted all of his life, a stance he thought necessary, not only for his writing career, but also for his place in American society.”

Brinig wrote 24 novels between 1929 and 1958. His most popular was Wide Open Town, originally published in 1931 and described by The New York Times as “a flamboyant epic of Butte in the heyday of copper mining and the lusty confluence of frontiersmen, saloons and brothels.” The rights to another novel, The Sisters (1937), were purchased by Warner Brothers and the subsequent film adaptation, starring Errol Flynn and Bette Davis, was released the following year. The Sadness in Lexington Avenue (1951) and The Street of Three Friends (1953), his last two novels published by Stanley Rinehart, were not well received by critics and sold poorly. The publisher dropped Brinig from his list. One final novel followed, The Looking Glass Heart, published in 1958 by Sagamore Press.

Brinig died on May 13, 1991, at the age of 94. By then, both he and his novels had faded into obscurity. In fact, none of his works were in print at the time of his death despite being compared early in his career to Thomas Wolfe and considered “among our best young writers.” (The Forum, April 1931)
WHERE THE MONEY WILL GO

876,168753337,"ABOUT BROOKLYN CIDER HOUSE
Two siblings and a friend quit their jobs to grow apples, make cider, and share their love of food, life, and drink. Their mission is to make really great cider with one simple ingredient: the apple. Help Brooklyn Cider House, Brooklyn's first farm cidery, with the final phase of the buildout of their 12,000 square foot cidery, restaurant, and bar.
Founders: Susan Yi, Peter Yi, and Lindsey Storm
Our cider rapture started in the Basque Country when Peter Yi, who was a wine buyer at the time, took a break from tasting wines to visit a sagardotegi. Delicious food, incredible ciders, and elated diners filled the cidery with pure magic. He was amazed by how well the natural cider paired with literally everything and how good he felt the next day. It was a thunderbolt moment and not long after his trip, Peter told his sister Susan, ""We need to make a cider house in Brooklyn."" He was dead serious and within weeks, Peter walked away from a business he built for 25 years and Susan quit teaching to study apples and hard cider.
Our First Trials in Peter's Garage (2014)
That was the spring of 2014. We didn't know a bushel from a bin of apples. What we did know was that we wanted to make a delicious, all-natural cider.
Lindsey Storm joined the founding team in 2015 and since then we have revitalized a Hudson Valley orchard, where we built a cidery, tasting room, farm store, and pavilion that serves wood-fired pizza and burgers. We've also planted 40 acres of baby trees of heirloom hard cider varieties, which should be in production in 4-5 years. 
Giving Love to Our Baby Cider Apple Trees!
BROOKLYN BUILDOUT
Presently, we have turned our energy to the final phase of the project, which is to open the doors to a full-scale cidery, restaurant, tasting room, and bar in Bushwick, Brooklyn. We will offer a farm-to-table menu perfectly paired with our ciders and made with timeless homespun methods to highlight simple, fresh ingredients. We will also spearhead and house cider events, educational workshops, tastings, and harvest celebrations. We don’t just want to be a successful place of business. We hope to make Brooklyn Cider House a place of innovation, creativity, history, and community, and one day, to be a hallmark of Bushwick and Brooklyn, recognized for capturing the spirit of Brooklyn with something local, something crafted, something smart, and wildly natural.

  We started the Brooklyn buildout at the same time we purchased Twin Star Orchards, but our Brooklyn location faced a slew of permitting issues that have really slowed the project down and sapped our budget. The delays have forced us to make some cuts to our original plans for the Brooklyn venue. The barnwood finishes and original art, however, are two things we don't want to sacrifice.
We are thrilled to be working with a master carpenter who is installing beautiful barnwood beams and finishes throughout. We are also hoping to commission two talented artists, Dede and Pixel Pancho to custom design and install murals inside and outside our venue.

A pastor who loses his daughter to a murderous robbery, a trouble teen who is stuck between crossroads, and a drug addicted soon to be father who only cares about causing pain to others will all soon realize that they must be saved by walking in the spirit of Christ.  Otherwise, they will be lost forever in the sinful world that surrounds them.  How will these individuals come together to know Christ?  Families will fall apart, lives will be changed, and faith will be tested."
878,2040753838,"You may already know us for our ground-breaking and award-winning smart bicycle lights, all launched on Kickstarter. If you don’t know See.Sense, we’re an enthusiastic bunch of bike-riding designers and technologists dedicated to changing the world... for cycling... by doing things a bit differently.
With AIR, we’ve taken everything we’ve learned across everything we’ve done to create a clever little device to help you rest easy, knowing where your bike is anytime, anywhere. 
 It’s a combination of a few things. But let’s just say AIR is engineered the See.Sense way. It's designed to be the most effective bike tracking device available on the market.
After a quick set-up, AIR operates all on its own... quietly doing its job in the background while you carry on living your life. It knows what’s happening all around it, immediately letting you know if it’s been moved, if it’s been stolen (more about this later), if it’s been in a crash and even what the road conditions are like around it. Pretty smart, eh?
You know that ‘find my smartphone’ feature? Think of that but for your bike. We’ve brought all our experience in smart sensor engineering to locate your bike down to the nearest couple of metres. However, even the smartest sensor is only as good as the network coverage around it, so being the first bike tracking device to operate across the Narrowband Internet of Things LPWA Network means AIR will work where your smartphone does when in an NB-IoT territory. Don’t worry, any techies can get deeper into NB-IoT with a bit more scrolling.
With a battery charge required every three months or so and a quick set-up to iOS and Android apps, AIR is uniquely fit-and-forget.  It’s also a sleek and light device, weighing only around 80 grams, fitting unobtrusively to your bike.  But even more than that, it’s intelligent; it knows how close you are to your bike and switches into its defense modes accordingly to let you know what’s happening to your bike.
We’re not talking about the stuff you breathe... although we do think this device is pretty essential too. Locks and chains definitely have their place but they can’t do everything. In fact, sometimes, they simply can’t do enough. Let’s talk through the features that showcase the AIR advantage:
‘Fight Mode’ is AIR’s always-on self-defense setting, sounding its in-built alarm and letting everyone around it know if your bike’s being moved. You’ll also get an immediate SMS alert notification, allowing you to check your bike there-and-then. You can rest easy on that club ride coffee stop, or city centre breather, knowing that AIR’s guard is up.
AIR will understand if it’s being stolen, automatically switching to its ‘Flight’ setting and rapidly transmitting high-powered tracking signals and locating your bike to the nearest couple of metres. If the worst happens, you can quickly pass AIR’s GPS location to police, giving a better chance of recovery. Think of it as an electronic tag for your bike.
AIR can keep more than just your bike safe, it’ll also help keep you safe, detecting if you’ve been involved in a crash and automatically sending an SMS to your assigned contact with your precise location, should the worst happen. Help is always within reach with AIR; it’s security and safety in one little unit.
AIR’s battery lifetime is unique for a bike-tracking device as we’ve built it on new NB-IoT low power wide area network (LPWAN) technology. We promised a bit more for those with a techie appetite and we don’t want to disappoint anyone, so here goes... LPWA is specifically designed for connecting devices with low bandwidth requirements, using low power whilst providing wider and deeper network coverage. Many millions of devices will be connected via LPWA networks in the next few years and See.Sense is proud to be the first to apply its use to protect the most important thing to any cyclist... their bike.
LPWA will operate across multiple bands worldwide, powered by the Vodafone IoT network, so we’re manufacturing three different AIR models, each designed to work in the correct band for the appropriate network coverage of the territory. We’ve included a list of countries and bands below for reference:
Band 20 / Most of Europe: 
United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Spain, Portugal, The Netherlands, Czech Republic, Malta, Turkey.
Band 8 / Australia, Africa & Asia:
South Africa, Australia, New Zealand.
Planned rollout of NB-IoT Networks from late 2020 include:
USA (late 2020), Russia, France, Switzerland, Denmark, Austria, Croatia, Poland, Slovakia, Norway.
We love the Kickstarter platform and the Kickstarter community because it allows us to really reward those who back us from the start. We offer a variety of pledges for AIR, each designed around the needs of our community, however, Kickstarter backers of all levels get two years’ free connection per device purchased. After 24 months, network connection will cost only around 3 pence per day for a year’s subscription. So you can put a price on reassurance, and with See.Sense, that price is low.
PLAY

AIR’s first defence in Fight Mode is its alarm, which packs quite a punch for such a small and discreet device - check out the short clip above to hear AIR’s sounder in action. In our (slightly OTT) way, we’ve tested a range of different tones, pitches, patterns, then engineered a bespoke alarm specifically for AIR to get as much attention as possible and help cancel your bike being taken.  Although the alarm will sound in Flight Mode, we’ve left it customisable so you can choose to turn it on/off or decide how long it should sound... it’s all up to you.
AIR is fixed to your bike quickly and securely using the security tools and bolts provided. AIR’s mounting kit is not only a tamper-resistant package but it’s a versatile one, with multiple mounting options available out of the box, allowing you to fix discreetly under the saddle or below the bottle cage. Fitting AIR in these locations means best-in-class connection to the network, accurately tracking your bike’s location and ensuring a battery life of months, not days.
Our R&D process involved consultation with antenna design specialists responsible for several generations of the market-leading smartphone.  This was crucial to locate the device in a way that could deliver the best-in-class network connection and battery life we knew was the missing link in effective bike tracking.  Once we had this design feedback, we then consulted with our customers and the findings were very clear... first-and-foremost, the tracker needed to locate their bike quickly every time, and if it could mount under a saddle (or under a bottle cage), that would be just fine. So we listened and we acted. As any existing customers know, this is the See.Sense way.
AIR therefore fixes to your bike quickly and securely using the security tools and bolts provided in a tamper-resistant and versatile package, with multiple mounting options available out of the box.
AIR can also make your experience of cycling better. The device is built on See.Sense advanced sensor technology and will monitor your environment as you ride, detecting issues such as poor road surface/route conditions. See.Sense then aggregates and de-personalises this data to work with city planners and advocacy groups to improve conditions for cycling for everyone. When we say AIR is smart, we really mean it.
See.Sense has already worked with cities including London, Manchester, Dublin and Antwerp to use these insights and we’re proud to be the Official Crowdsourced Data Insights supplier to British Cycling and Official Ride Insights supplier to Cycling Ireland.
We proudly manufacture in Northern Ireland, ensuring our products are made of the highest quality materials and components, and according to our exacting standards.
With six successful launches before AIR, we’ve built huge experience of manufacturing and distributing our products at scale. The diagram below indicates our expected timeline for AIR’s production.
 All Kickstarter purchases include 2 years’ free connection.
AIR will be shipped with both saddle rail and bottle cage mounts, a charging cable, a security torx key and optional See.Sense stickers to identify the device as a deterrent, should you wish to do so.

Our product tester team included everyone from elite pro athletes, homebodies, PhDs, everyday ballers, international travelers, best friends, and all kinds of awesome in between. We had our testers run, skip, jump and philosophize while wearing product to make sure that our Bamboxer-briefs stood up to all the bragging we were doing. 
We gave our testers plenty of time to try things out. Underwear is meant to be lived in, not just looked at, right? After that, we listened to their feedback, made some small tweaks, and finalized our designs. And all in time for early-bird holiday shipping.

Ningo, along with being the modeling talent, protects the office from the big, scary mailman. He's a good boy, yes he is. 
OUR PROCESS
Behind the Seams
Way back in 2008, we got the idea to redefine how people clothe themselves (from the bottom up, of course). On a mission to make awesomely soft and durable boxer-briefs, we went searching for the best fabric, the best process, and the best facilities.
Our quest brought us to China (that's where most of the worlds bamboo grows), where we spent 3 months researching bamboo fiber and how we could spin it into Bamboxer gold. We made sure to do our homework. While overseas, we studied every step of the sourcing and production process and evaluated the environmental impact of our manufacturing methods. 
Pre-boxers
We tried some really cutting edge stuff, but we knew that unless we had excellent quality, we would be making a compromise to our potential customers. Once we were happy with the material, we picked out a waistband that felt great, determined the best way to stitch everything together, came up with the washing label, landed on the best fabric dyeing methods for long term quality, selected the sturdiest thread, consumed unholy amounts of coffee, and reworked our designs to better suit your birthday suit. Phew. 
Our goal was to make the most comfortable boxer-briefs on the market. So we did. 
And now we're here. From Seattle, to China, back to Seattle, and now to you. Bamboxers goes the distance, and we're focused on what matters: underwear. Lots and lots of underwear.
WHAT WE'VE SPENT OUR TIME ON... SO FAR
2008: We couldn’t stop thinking about insanely comfortable boxer-briefs that would be a good balance of environmental sustainability and utmost longterm quality.  If you are going to buy them, we want them to last, because if you just throw them away after a year, that fills up landfills, an act we hope to minimize.
The idea floated around in our heads for a long while and we spent lots of time designing the best fabric and ensuring the best production partners.
2009: We found that our other clothing company was taking tons of our time, so instead of rush and push out Bamboxers.com, we took a short hiatus from the 'heaven in your pants' project. 
2013: We revitalized our quest for even better fabric than we had yet designed, mostly focused on increasing the quality and comfort of the raw material.
March 2015: Eureka!  We think we've got it!  The stars align with an awesome, high quality bamboo viscose blend.  We made our first prototypes and started putting them through rigorous testing. 
July 2015: We got awesome feedback from our team of top notch product testers from all over the world and from all walks of life. 
August 2015: We made some finishing touches. 
October 2015:  Lots of fun planning our launch and filming our own video! 
November 2015: Our Kickstarter campaign is launched, and we're trying to get these things in as many peoples hands as possible, because we know that once you have them, you will never wear another pair of boxer briefs! "

Help our dancers connect with others in Costa Rica and Nicaragua! 
--TOTAL PROJECT COST: 19,520 ----- WHAT WE ASK FROM YOU: 9,500--
“The great thing about JUNTOS is that it takes this idea [that the understanding of different cultures is what will bring peace to the world] and connects it to concrete actions… Something inside me has really changed. I feel so inspired to do more because there is so much to be done."" - Marisa Martin, Excerpt of letter written to the director after our 2010 Guatemalan exchange
WHO ARE WE?
JUNTOS (“together” in Spanish) was founded in 2008 by Joanna Poz-Molesky with other college students. We’re a collective of performing artists from various university dance conservatories in New York and California (Ailey/Fordham, Juilliard, LINES/Dominican, and SUNY Purchase) committed to social justice and community outreach through dance. We teach and perform in many local and international locations while focusing on communities that aren’t granted much exposure to art.

Over the past 4 years, we’ve had the opportunity to travel and share in central Mexico and Guatemala six times. We’ve also created multiple smaller projects in New York and the San Francisco Bay Area. We teach workshops and perform in various hospitals, retirement homes, orphanages, centers for HIV+ children, as well as for dancers with limited access to training and large public audiences. In total, we have worked with hundreds of children in workshops and have performed for thousands of people from diverse backgrounds. All our activities are free of cost.
WHAT DO WE HOPE TO BE DOING IN COSTA RICA AND NICARAGUA?
We would love to expand our project more and with your help (juntos!) we can do that!
We hope to offer 8 of our student dancers from New York City and the San Francisco Bay Area an opportunity to travel to Costa Rica and Nicaragua to collaborate with residents, engage in intercultural exchange, and connect with various diverse communities. With your help, we will: Teach movement workshops to local youth in rural communities and cities alike; Perform for communities unfamiliar with contemporary performing arts; Collaborate and exchange with local artists, workshop participants, audience members, and volunteers; Explore various traditional and contemporary expressions local to each country; Read more on our website (detailed description coming soon!)
WHY IS DANCE IMPORTANT?
create JOY; UNIFY body, mind, and spirit; NURTURE and promote creativity, confidence, and individuality; TRANSCEND languages, race, religion, cultures, and customs, enabling us as human beings to connect on the most essential level; OFFER a means of self-expression; STIMULATE both interdependence and collaboration
“We are humans. We have common feelings: joy, sadness, fear, love. It doesn’t take much to understand another’s story. Language holds limitations, but art breeds possibilities. If we dance for an audience and we use our spirits to do so, connection happens. We are here for each other. To share, to understand, to come together."" -Marisa Martin, Excerpt from “Thoughts on Guatemala, Part II.” June 10, 2011
HOW ARE YOUR FUNDS HELPING?
Our total costs for the project are $19,520. We hope you can help with some of this! Covering participant costs is a big challenge, especially when travelling abroad. Individual support has always been key to allowing JUNTOS to continue to facilitate both local and global outreach projects! Your donation, made right here on Kickstarter, will take us one step closer to accomplishing our JUNTOS collective goals! You’re helping with..
Air & ground transportation: $12,100 – Funding our air transportation from the U.S. to Costa Rica and from Nicaragua to the U.S. is essential. We also need funding for our travels to towns, villages, and cities near San Jose, Costa Rica and Managua, Nicaragua.
Housing while abroad: $3,920 – After a fulfilling day of workshops and traveling, nothing would be nicer than a shower and a bed. That’s where you can help! We need to provide shelter 8 dancers + 4 staff members for 2 weeks!
Production and promotion: $3,500 -  (costumes, venue rentals, performance permits, promotional material, and resources for our participants abroad!) - We are a spending-savvy group that has learned to be flexible and resourceful with our past budgets, but we still need help with the logistics!

Character creation in Three-Step Plan is an exciting, adrenaline-filled scramble, and by the end you'll have a fully fleshed out character built for adventure.
This game is meant to be played in one evening with little to no prep, so it's perfect to break out when your wizard bails on the party last minute.
Rendered Image
What makes this project unique?
The strongest and most unique elements to Three-Step plan are as follows:
- Since your character has a main objective, and a plan to complete that objective (the three steps), you start the game with a strong sense of purpose. Since each other player will have a character with equally strong motivations, the adventure will have a strong focus, and the characters will waste no time getting into trouble. 
- The characters, with some meddling from the GM, are dropped into the game with their objectives connected to the other players around the table. Even though everyone has their own objective, trying to complete these objectives at the same time is going to bring them together, often in exciting, explosive, and entertaining ways. 
- Character creation is a game. From the get-go, you are invested in your character, trying to get the equipment and traits you need before the other players scoop them up. Because of the dice, there will be some randomness to what is available, but at the same time, you have lots of control over what you choose for your character.

""A rule-lite, no prep RPG that focuses on character creation as the most important element of the game. If this works as advertised, creating a character-centric RPG that lets you craft unique characters and spotlight them which might give plot-driven RPGs some competition. Going character-driven is a welcome direction for the gaming world.""
- Egg Embry: enworld.org

""Let’s be honest, there are plenty of RPG systems out there already with some possibly older than yourself. Three-Step Plan is a rules-light system but heavy on content. The creator clearly understands that a true RPG system is not about hack-and-slash or amassing make-believe wealth but for players to roleplay their characters towards the achievement of their personal goals.""
- Milo Alejo: tabletopunited.com

""All of this packed into a single game session! Everyone I've played Three-Step Plan with has wanted to play again. Dallas has done a great job with his concept and mechanics and put together a terrific game.""
- Joe Tomkins: Playtester
Other note-worthy aspects to the game 
- This game can be played with no prep, and in one sitting. 
- It is rules lite, and highly focused on narrative and character development instead of rules. This allows the story to progress quickly, permitting the group to get through a full story with a beginning, a climax, and a conclusion.
- Every character has an objective that is secret from the other players (but not hidden from the GM). They may be admirable or nefarious, but that will only come out as the story unfolds. 
- Since the game relies on characters with strong motivation, it's easy for first time role players to get into their characters.

What's in the book?
Here's a look into what I have packed into the book.
Humble Beginnings 
I started working on this project in 2018. I began creating it because I wanted something to create just for fun, just for the pleasure of creating. When my son was born, it gave me something to do while I was up late rocking him to sleep. It kept me sane as I took breaks from writing papers and presentations for my masters classes. It slowly took shape, and what I ended up with was more fun than I ever could have hoped. It took lots of re-working, re-writing, play-testing, and editing, but what I have here now is something I am proud to share with you.

How we cut down on expenses (to pass the savings onto you)
I wrote the book on my own time and am friends with many talented people who believed in what I was creating and wanted to support me with their expertise. My sister filmed the videos on her cellphone and edited them on a free trial of Final Cut. I am friends with an English teacher who spent hours pouring over the material looking for (and finding) errors. I am blessed with many groups of gamers who were willing to play rough drafts of this game. Bernie the graphic designer agreed to design the book for a small cut of the profit. It was really a coming together of some amazing people who acted selflessly to make this project a reality.

Three-Step Plan is a great game that has been worked on by a small group of talented people. It is in the final steps of the process and needs one more thing.  It needs people interested in the project to make it a reality.  It needs you. Please check out my videos below, and consider backing this project today. 

THE DICE SYSTEM:
This video outlines how I have taken various dice mechanics and tailored them into a quick and easy new system.
CHARACTER CREATION: 
 This video describes how to piece your character together. The process is a game in and of itself and requires no preparation ahead of time.
RUNNING THE GAME:  
With so much unknown, how does a game master prepare for a session of Three-Step Plan? Watch this video to see how the game relies on strong character motivation rather than game master prep.

887,346870982,"OVERVIEW.
In JAN 2011, I will be crossing the South Atlantic Ocean on a 72-foot sail boat (for over 30 days) with 12 other people to study plastic pollution that has made it's way from land to the middle of the ocean. I am raising $5000 for my spot on the 5 Gyres research voyage. I plan to do this through Kickstarter (this online system) and a fundraiser event on DEC 3 in San Francisco (see below). Funding over $5000 will be applied towards flights. Any funds not used towards boat or travel (flights only) will be donated to 5 Gyres.
WHAT.
I have been invited to participate on a research expedition in JAN 2011, lead by the 5 Gyres Institute, to study plastic pollution in the South Atlantic Ocean. The 5 Gyres Institute is a non-profit organization dedicated to conducing research on plastic pollution and building public awareness around plastic pollution issues. The expedition begins in Cape Town, South Africa and travels to Montevideo, Uruguay, via Walvis Bay, Namibia and St. Helena Island. The purpose of the expedition is to bring together artists, scientists, ocean lovers, and activists, to conduct scientific research and increase public awareness on issues related to plastic pollution in our oceans. The expedition will contribute scientific information on the density of plastic pollution in the South Atlantic Ocean and increase public awareness about plastic pollution through various outlets (blogs, websites, news, photography, art).
I plan to write daily blog entries that document the scientific research, life on the vessel, each crew member's purpose and goals related to the voyage, the environment that we explore, and how marine life and the ocean are being impacted by plastic pollution. In addition to the daily blog entries, I plan to document my voyage through photographs by creating a photo essay project with photographs from each day of travel.
I am raising $5,000 for 5 Gyres to be on the January 2011 Research Expedition. The money will fund the research vessel (72' sail boat) and plastic pollution research and outreach projects. Each participant on the voyage is required to help raise funding for the expedition costs. I also hope to raise money for the cost of airfare to South Africa and return flight from Uruguay. Any funding not used towards travel costs will be donated to 5 Gyres. I am taking 7 weeks off work, 4 weeks unpaid, so I will be spending my own money too to make this opportunity happen.
WHY.
Plastic pollution has been found at the bottom of the food chain in plankton in many sections of our oceans but the extent of the plastic pollution is not well documented or studied. The bellies of fish and birds are full of plastic. Fish hormones may be changing due to chemicals found in plastic. And it is nearly impossible to go to a beach without finding a piece of plastic pollution.
Historically, plastic debris in the ocean was thought to be from the fishing and cruise ship industry, but researchers now believe that about 80% of plastic pollution comes from run-off (through storm drains and trash blowing into the ocean) and unregulated trash management (not all countries have the same kind of trash control as the USA). Before 1965, trash was composed of paper goods, food, and other material but since the plastic bottle and plastic packaging industries started booming, our trash has become more durable (plastic takes hundreds and hundreds of years to breakdown and never decomposes). The plastic pollution found in the ocean is mainly plastic bottle caps, plastic toys, plastic bottles, plastic wrappers, plastic bags, plastic pens, plastic food containers...this is the plastic material that we all use in our everyday lives and I am sure we can live without a lot of it.
WHAT YOU CAN DO.
Become aware of your plastic consumption and learn more about plastic pollution in our oceans. Donate to projects that focus on plastic pollution research and are dedicated to raising awareness on the issues related to plastic pollution, like THIS PROJECT.

If you donate here (online) and come to my DEC 3 Fundraiser Event - I will give you 2 tickets for the RAFFLE as a thank you!
WHAT I WILL DO FOR YOU.
For everyone - I plan to keep my blog updated, as much as possible. If internet is not available while I am on the voyage, I will blog for weeks when I return. I will be writing a blog for EACH day while I am on the voyage.
For everyone who DONATES - I will bring you a photograph from my voyage. Photographs are very powerful and I hope to take some photographs that show the intensity of the plastic pollution.
For the top 10 donations - I will send you a photography book with a photograph from each day of my voyage.

888,1151247609,"Album 2015 er en realitet hvilket vi simpelthen ikke kan få hænderne ned over. TAK ALLE SAMMEN. Vi har stadig lidt tid tilbage som aktiv kampagne, folk bliver ved med at donere, og derfor vil vi gerne huske at sige at hver en krone går til bedre programmer og lækre ting. (Vi arbejder på at udvide konceptet - evt med et par live-optagelser - samt andre overraskelser ift selve programmerne. Det bliver muligt med ekstra cash.)
OG: Så vil vi gerne komme med et løfte (eller et ""stretch goal"" i Kickstarter-lingo): Hvis vi når 125.000,- så laver vi 11 programmer i stedet for 10! (Hvorfor ikke ved 120.000,- spørger du? Fordi vi også vil støtte The Lake Radio - der muliggør vores udsendelser og er et komplet con amore-projekt - med de første 5000,- vi går over budget. Lyt til deres mange fine ting her.)

Hvad er Album 2015?
Kender du det, når en dedikeret musikfan spiller en plade for dig fra ende til anden og råber entusiastisk op om hvorfor det, du hører, er intet mindre end ge-ni-alt? Det var sådan vi – i ungdomsværelser, studenterlejligheder, togkupeer – lærte mange af vores yndlingsplader at kende. Fordi vores bedste venner forklarede os om det bedste i verden: Deres yndlingsplader. Det var god gammeldags indføring af en believer, en rablende entusiast, et menneske fuld af kærlighed til musik.
Det er vi også. Og vi savner at formidle vores kærlighed til og indsigt i verdens bedste musik. Vi savner at give dig oplevelsen af at sidde med dine bedste venner og blive indført i musikhistoriens vigtigste plader – i højkvalitetslyd og med mange års erfaring som extra material. Vi vil være dine over-entusiastiske fan-venner.
Vi har gjort det før. For nogle år siden lavede vi en serie programmer ved navn ’Album’ på DR’s radiokanal P6Beat. I alt blev det til 30 programmer om ‘The Queen is Dead’ af The Smiths, ‘Thriller’ af Michael Jackson, ‘“Heroes”’ af David Bowie, ’Spirit of Eden’ af Talk Talk, ’Hounds of Love’ af Kate Bush, ‘Expensive Shit’ af Fela Kuti, ‘Blue’ af Joni Mitchell og mange flere af vores absolutte favoritter.
Men så sluttede programmet. Og lige siden har det kriblet sådan i os. Der er noget, der mangler. Der er så mange gode plader derude, der ikke er blevet udsat for vores bedrevidende, fabulerende, kropslige, nørdede og slubrende kærlighed. Vores liste er så lang! Og vi er blevet afhængige af det.
Det har vi på fornemmelsen at andre også er. ‘Album’ er blevet flittigt podcastet lige siden, og på de utallige mails og tweets virker det som om at det ikke kun er os, der fandt en eller anden mening i serien.
Vi kan ikke blive enige med DR om en videreførelse af serien, så nu søger vi andre jagtmarker. Vi har lavet et samarbejde med ‘The Lake’ – en allerede stærkt rost internet-radiostation startet af Efterklang, Kasper Vang og Jan Høgh Stricker – og sammen med dem vil vi gerne vække ‘Album’ fra de døde. Besøg The Lake her.
Denne gang i en mere publikumsinddragende version, hvor du kan være med til at vælge din yndlingsplade – ud fra vores liste – som emne for ‘Album’. Og hvor dine kommentarer kan blive en del af programmet.
Altså: En række 1,5-3 timer lange programmer. Én plade pr. program. Hver gang en dedikeret, researchet og frådende gennemgang af musikken, produktionen, betydningen, politikken, lyden, poesien, kropsbehåringen, indvirkningen på stjernerne, betydningen for samtiden, eftermælet – samt ikke mindst med kommentarer fra fans.
Når vi når vores mål garanterer vi 10 podcasts om 10 forskellige plader, udvalgt fra bruttolisten nedenfor.
Vi har brug for din hjælp for at få det til at ske. Og det skal ske.
Med kærlig hilsen,
Ralf Christensen og Kristian Leth
---
Nogle tanker om listen: 
10 plader skal vælges ud fra bruttolisten.
Vi har undgået plader med kunstnere vi allerede har lavet programmer om, på trods af at Bowie, Springsteen og Wonder fx alle har flere plader der er værdige.
For første gang har vi smidt nogle danske plader med. Og ja, det er noget andet at tale om danske plader, de betyder noget andet for os, og derfor skal vi ikke ud i nogle lange retfærdiggørelser eller sammenligninger med nogle af de tidsløse internationale klassikere, der også er på listen. Det er nok at sige at vi kun har skrevet forrygende værker på, og at disse danske pladers vægt ikke er til at underkende. Respekt.
Derudover er der en let blanding af Bangers og Mysterier. Disse kategorier er idiosynkratiske, dybt upålidelige og afhængige af værternes temperament. Men tanken er at vi skal have plads til BÅDE kanoniserede hovedværker OG obskure plader hvis betydning vi mener skal fremhæves i opposition til den herskende musik-mytologi. Her er vores indstilling at du selvfølgelig ikke behøver kende pladen for at nyde programmet, og vores håb er at vi netop kan åbne det pågældende værk på vidt gab, så du ender programmet som fan.
Til sidst skal det igen understreges at: VI har dømt disse plader som værdige til Album 2015. Mangler vi nogen? Ja. Er listen komplet? LANGT FRA! Vi har blinde punkter og kæpheste. Og så er vi helt vildt gode til det her. Sådan er det. (Men skriv gerne til os med din yndlingsplade, som vi har glemt!)

890,296563478,"I am an artist seeking funds to carry out my upcoming exhibition of paintings: Sacred/Wild
Silverback
What is Sacred/Wild?
Sacred/Wild is a series of large scale ink paintings on paper of wild animals in sacred, spiritual spaces. I will have an exhibition of these paintings in Paros, Greece in mid August of this year. Sacred/Wild has been a very interesting and exciting project to work on in that I am learning as I go about what I want to say about these pieces.  We have our cultural as well as personal ideas of wild animals, whether they are wolves, chimpanzees, leopards…and we have other ideas regarding certain spaces, especially religious and sacred spaces. By connecting the two different worlds together one acts as a bridge between the two ideas, and in that way each interpretation can be very different depending on the viewer. I also would like the images to feel real--as if these animals were actually there in these spaces. Ultimately I want the animals to appear natural in these environments which they would otherwise never be associated with.
Why ink?
I work with ink because it is such a versatile medium. It can be very dark and bold on one hand and light and subtle on the other.  Ink allows for very smooth transitions in tone which is very helpful when evoking light bouncing around a big Gothic cathedral.  Also, when working with ink one has to learn to let go and let the ink move freely across the paper.  The element of not being able to control the ink is something which I really enjoy, and leads to many beautiful marks I couldn't otherwise predict or plan.
Here are some images of the works:
Peacock
detail of Chimapanzees
Leopard
Why Kickstarter?
The Sacred/Wild exhibition will be my first show in three years.  I will be putting up this exhibition on my own in an independent space in Paros, Greece.  Because I will not be going through a gallery, the costs of setting up the exhibition itself will be carried solely by myself.  My goal is that through the Kickstarter platform this fundraising project will allow me to to have the best show I could possibly have.
Your pledges will go to:
Materials for making more and larger artwork to display
Rent to pay for the space itself over the course of August, 2012
Frames for the paintings as they are large scale works on paper
The printing of an exhibition catalog collecting all the images.
Promotion for the exhibition itself including postcards, flyers and posters
Rewards for your pledges:
In return for your pledges, there will be rewards based upon your contribution amount.  Rewards will include:
A mailed postcard print of one of my paintings
A handpainted postcard in ink with a personal message handwritten on the back like this:
A limited edition, signed, archival print of one of the images
A print of the first sketch that triggered the idea for the series:
Deer in a Temple
The full exhibition catalog featuring all of the images from the series Sacred/Wild

A large, original ink and/or watercolor painting like these:

Sea Foam
A personalized original watercolor or ink painting for you
How Kickstarter works:
Through Kickstarter individuals are able to make pledges of any size through the Amazon.com account.  Kickstarter is an all or nothing platform.  This means if there are enough pledges to reach the goal then the funding will be a go and your pledge will be sent on the day of the project deadline.  If there are not enough pledges then no money will be sent at all.

El miércoles 23 de diciembre nos encantaría poder volver a subir a las tablas retomando esta fantástica comedia que ya representamos el curso pasado. El sitio es el Teatro Lagrada de Madrid (Calle De Ercilla, 20), y la cita a las 20:00.
¿Por qué necesitamos que nos ayudes a través de Crowdfunding?
El alquiler de la sala asciende a 250€. Somos un grupo de teatro universitario, ¡no tenemos ánimo de lucro pero sí muchas ganas de hacer teatro!, y nuestra única manera de financiar nuestros proyectos es a través de los donativos del público que recaudamos en las representaciones. Pero esta vez, necesitamos pediros los donativos antes de la función, a través de esta plataforma, para poder hacer frente al alquiler de la sala.
Además del alquiler, tenemos que poner a punto el resto del atrezzo e imprimir los programas; por eso, y teniendo en cuenta el pellizco que se queda la plataforma (el 5% de lo que nos donéis), hemos puesto el objetivo en 300€.
Por eso, si vas a venir a vernos el 23 de diciembre a las 20:00 al Teatro Lagrada y nos regalas un poco de ayuda, además de hacerte disfrutar con esta estupenda obra de teatro tendremos algún detalle para ti.
Y si no puedes venir a vernos, pero también quieres colaborar, también te estaremos enormemente agradecidos, y te podremos enviar a casa un pequeño obsequio de la obra como agradecimiento.

IMPORTANTE: si vas a venir a vernos, después de hacer la donación confirma tu asistencia mandando un correo a katharsismedicina@gmail.com .  
(Si no, no podremos saber qué donaciones corresponden a los que vienen a vernos, o a quienes sólo quieren colaborar y no vendrán a la representación).
¡Muchísimas gracias por tu ayuda! "
892,223277596,"Our Mission
Evoke Dance Company is a non-profit contemporary and hip-hop group that provides a dance haven to diverse artists and gives back to the community. 
The Dancers
What makes Evoke Dance Company so unique is the compilation of dancers. Each dancer comes from a very different dance background, culture, and perspective. While some dancers are college students, others are full-time working professionals in various industries such as finance, education, and marketing. Regardless, all members sacrifice time and energy out of their full-time schedules to make this company succeed.  
The Show
Evoke Dance Company will be performing at the Aratani Theater/ Japan America Theater in Los Angeles on Saturday, June 22, 2013. The show features choreography by famous industry artists, but the majority of the pieces are choreographed by Evoke dancers themselves. The show will also feature collaborative performances with other community dance groups. 
This season, our is titled ""Therapy"" because for us, dance is a form of therapy. It’s our way of expressing thoughts and emotions, bringing balance and purpose to our lives. This season, we’d like to take you on a journey through dance as a source of relief, as a healing power, and as an escape from ourselves. In this performance, you will catch a glimpse into our minds from our victories and triumphs to our losses and sorrows. We want to tell you our stories in a way that can only be told through dance; we want to show you that it is more than just physical movement, but also a way to heal, to grow, and to share. For us, dance is our communication, our empathy. For us, dance is therapy."
893,444609322,"My name is Nora Belal. I work primarily in photography (norabelalphotography.com) but have always privately considered myself more of a sculptor. This exhibition, Icons and Monuments, is a chance to present some of my first large scale projects to the public. By large I mean a 20 foot high 16 foot long manila rope installation, A disintegrating wall of salt bricks, a flower staircase to nowhere and a 16 foot high all-encompassing  flower structure with salt, rope and scent components. I'm very interested in scent as art, and not in a yankee candle way, but in a  memory mapping fashion. 
The space I'm showing in is mind boggling, every time I look at photos I catch my breath because I can't believe I've been invited to take it over. SixTHreeFouR Studio is a true labor of love and is still making its name in Pittsburgh, by supporting me you will also be supporting a community oriented, experimental art territory powerhouse. 
  The only draw back is its in Pittsburgh and I'm in Boston. But, I've always welcomed the opportunity to change and explore, and a road trip with my pieces is just that. The gallery, SixTHreeFouR Studio, is a 20x40 ft. open air space covered in ivy. It features a wood stove, an additional event area, a garden and a birds nest made out of a trampoline (!??!!) 
The work in the gallery in this photo is unrelated to Icons and Monuments.
This space rejects the notion of an art exhibition being quiet contemplation and wine sipping and welcomes exploration, originative thought, and some serious party time the night of the opening, which is Friday August 1.  
Alas, with serious party time comes serious planning and material purchasing. Here is a quick breakdown of how your generosity will be put to use:
1136 mile round trip 10 ft truck rental including gas: $1710
2,500 feet of 1/2 inch manila rope: $4,325
salt, wood and other structural materials $500.00
As you can see, my goal is significantly lower than the actual cost. The $2,500 is the absolute minimum I need to make this project a reality, while $6,535 is what I need to fulfill the project exactly as I envision it in scale and scope. 
This exhibition is as much an exploration of concept as it is material and I'm grateful to have this opportunity and to be able to ask people like you to help me. Thank you so much for taking some time out to read about my project, Icons and Monuments. I + M has been a long time coming and to have the chance to produce and experiment with this work means so much to me as an artist and an individual.
Please check in at http://norabphotography.tumblr.com for snippets of the pieces in various states of completion over the course of the campaign, and to learn more about me."

          The idea for TRISET was born over 2 years ago when we discovered a void in the supplement space. We at TRISET are active working professionals and know that supplement use isn't always convenient but an important part of training. We wanted to create a product that encompassed every phase of our workout: before, during and after. We hate the inconvenience of hauling tubs of preworkout, BCAAs and protein in our cars and the mess that it caused so we decided to change the game.
 We also wanted to create a supplement that was actually good for you. We knew that the majority of supplements on the market had unnecessary fillers and ingredients that negated the positive effects they could have had if they had been formulated correctly. Having an actual physician (Dr. Porter) who specializes in supplements and training is a massive advantage to choosing TRISET over the competition.
Dr. Porter spent months perfecting the Triset formula, making sure that it was not only safe but helped athletes maximize results.
With your help, we can make TRISET a reality and change the way athletes train and recover.
  We are advocates of complete transparency when it comes to ingredients in our product.
Bogus ""proprietary blends"" and hidden ingredients are not what we're about. Below, you will find a list of every ingredient that will be in TRISET. What you see is what you get in every stick pack.
Preworkout - Apple Strawberry Blend Flavor
Triset Preworkout is only 10 calories per serving. An athlete will get more gain if they exercise in a fasting state. 
Beta Alanine and Creatine to maximize muscle performance 
The effectiveness of the B12 and Folate is increased with the addition of Betaine. 
Naturally sweetened with Stevia 
Intra- Strawberry Lemonade Flavor
BCAAS that actually work - BCAA's are essentially useless unless taken in a fasting state. It's tough to get great tasting BCAAAs, so Dr. Stuart suggest ""why take them if they aren't going to work!""
 Post - Berries & Cream Flavor
Carb Conscience - ""The most important health aspect that we can control is our blood sugar levels. Ideally, we exercise in a fasting state (or close to it) and replenish our carbohydrate stores post exercise. With Triset, we added the advised amount of carbs and protein to replenish effectively after a workout""-Dr. Porter 
 Joint Protection - Whether it be an elite athlete or a weekend warrior, you need to protect your joints. Triset post includeds MSM, Glucosamine and Chondrotin to help rebuild and protect those joints.

896,1079187081,"Recognized as the “king of all porcelain” in China, falangcai porcelain represents the country’s highest accomplishment in kiln-firing techniques.
According to historical records, by 1684 during Emperor Kangxi’s rule, Western copper cloisonné enamelware entered China from Guangzhou and other ports. European enamel craftsmen were invited to the imperial court to share their techniques, and from this basis, Chinese craftsmen then transferred the use of enamel onto porcelain, giving birth to falangcai porcelain in 1716. 
It was a precious secret kept in the imperial court, only a few deserving ministers were rewarded the gift. Elsewhere, it was hardly seen. As the craft was arduous, time consuming, and costly, the secret of falangcai porcelain was eventually lost by the end of Qianlong’s reign in1796 in the late Qing Dynasty. During the 100 year history of enamel use during the reigns of Kangxi, Yongzheng, and Qianlong, around 1,400 pieces were produced, and according to historical records, less than one third - around 400 pieces are preserved, mainly kept in the Palace Museum of Beijing and National Palace Museum in Taipei. At international auctions, these works repeatedly get high bidding offers, usually in hundreds of millions. Needless to say, they are extremely valuable.

  Falangcai Imperial Famille Rose “Swallows” Bowl from Qianlong period, Christie’s Hong Kong, 2006, hammer price 151,230,000 HKD.
THE ARTIST：
Sun Heyang, the first folk artist to replicate Chinese imperial falangcai porcelain.
Groping blindly and experimenting for 13 years, two generations of Sun’s family read several libraries worth of historical texts, trying thousands of kiln techniques while taking on financial and emotional strife, Sun finally succeeded in reviving the imperial falangcai porcelain technique that had been lost for more than two centuries. 
An Impossible Task: In 1999, Sun, a graduate in fashion design who had already made a name in the fashion world, was looking to try his hand at new endeavors. Persuaded by his father and uncle who are both porcelain artists living in Jingdezhen, he began to research the falangcai technique. 
For eight years, Sun and his father led a team of a dozen workers, invested their own funds in repeated attempts, tried and failed countless times and burned up their hard-earned savings soon. They failed to produce this special imperial porcelain, and on the day after the opening ceremony of 2008 Beijing Olympics, Sun’s father passed away. 
Sun spent a whole year to revive from the sadden reality and to restart the project, fueled by the desire to fulfill his dream and that of his deceased father.  
In 2013, Sun finally succeeded in producing a small bowl with the falangcai technique. He still recalls clearly his first reaction: “Father, your son has finally realized your dream.” Now every morning, he lights incense for his father, feeling as though the man is still by his side, guiding and protecting him through the biggest set backs and failures, always encouraging him to carry forward bravely. 
His father’s favorite phrase was: “You can fail for multiple times, but you have to learn from each failure and you must be steadfast in your work. In the art world you've chosen, not even an ounce of falsehood is allowed.” This pursuit of perfection encouraged Sun to move forward, seeing him through to the day when he could taste success.
From his first success of producing falangcai porcelain in 2013 until today, Sun’s team has not only revived the beauty of falangcai, they have also received high appraisal and recognition from the world of ceramics experts. The head of the National Museum of China’s center for appraisal of cultural relics, Yue Feng, says: “Zhenghegong has revived the imperial technique of falangcai, creating a contemporary artistic treasure. Today’s artworks are tomorrow’s cultural treasures.”
Falangcai ""Celestial Vase"" created by Sun was brought by Tiangong-2 to the outer space on Nov 25, 2016, the Mid-Autumn Day
THE HANDCRAFT & PRODUCTION：
Why each piece of falangcai porcelain is so valuable? The extremely difficult production results in very few completed works.
The production of falangcai porcelain includes 167 processes, from hand pulling clay and the gongbi painting method, to the application of color and repeated firings. To this day new, works continue to be made. Each step must be carried out flawlessly as even the smallest of imperfections can destroy any hope of completing a piece.
Why was the falangcai research process so difficult? The first reason is the rarity of the raw material. The second is the complexity of the decorative process. The third is the difficulty of the firing process. These factors severely limit the amount of falangcai porcelain that can be made. Completed works are extremely rare.
The raw clay used to produce falangcai porcelain must be extremely pure. From one ton of porcelain clay, only half a kilo is suitable for use. Similarly, only pure, natural precious stones can be used to make pigments for color. They cannot have pollutants, and must be high density and high luster. During the Qing Dynasty, the oil used for falangcai porcelain, called Dolmen oil, was imported from Persia and cannot be found today. Its origins are also impossible to trace. 
Sun’s team developed their own natural vegetable-based oil (Dolmen oil) used to mix the pigments of falangcai porcelain, and through countless attempts, they solved the dilemma of finding an adhesive that could bind the pigment to the ceramic surface.
The decorative patterning of falangcai porcelain are elaborate and similar to oil painting, using oil as one of the ingredients. With no foundation or clear glaze on the surface necessary, simply the thickness of the color itself creates variation of shades causing the decorative pattern to visibly protrude and giving it a sparkling luster. With a wide range of details in color, fine details can be magnified for appreciation.
The firing process of falangcai porcelain is also very difficult and differs from the firing process of blue and white ceramics—which can be completed in a single firing. Falangcai porcelain must be fired multiple times. The patterns must be redrawn and color reapplied, then sent back into the kiln all before a perfect piece can be completed. This makes the rate of completion extremely limited.
The firing process of falangcai porcelain is also rife with uncertainties. With variations in the weather’s humidity , the heat of the kiln and the time needed for firing may vary. 
Across the four seasons of the year, the temperature of the kiln, the time allotted for firing, and the object’s position inside in the kiln may very. If these aspects are not further researched, the risks are high.
Data from the tremendous number of successes and failures has been collected by Sun’s team, with thousands of entries for the different color combinations all forming a large database. With any given falangcai piece, the team can use their own color cards, compiled from summarizing the data, and compare them to the porcelain to gauge what temperature and what humidity resulted in the effect. These attributes have all been studied quite thoroughly.
How To Appreciate Falangcai?
According to The Book of Ceramics, There are  ""four delights of falangcai porcelain"":
""White grain, as white as snow—the first;
Thin as eggshell or the murmur of desire escaping a lover’s lips—the second;
Refinement exuded in even the smallest of details, light dances upon flower petals busting into a breadth of brilliant colors and the soft down of butterfly wings, while the neck is poised gracefully—the third.
Writing and motif in calligraphy and seal are as thin as the head of a fly—the fourth.""
Introducing ""Butterfly Lovers Cup – Falangcai Cup With Budding Flowers And Butterflies"" & Why Kickstarter:
The design was inspired by the invaluable counterpart belongs to the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago from the Qianlong period. The Butterfly Lovers is one of China’s oldest myths of eternal love: two butterflies appear accompanied with entangled flowers, representing the continuous circle of life and gift passed down from generation to generation. 
Butterfly Lovers represents everlasting love, commitment and loyalty. The cup symbolizes the sincerest wish for love and eternity.
Packaging for the Butterfly Lovers cup follows the carpentry methods of the Qing Dynasty, using nanmu (evergreen) wood to make an opulent case constructed with mortise and tenon joints.
From the first time in 1716, when the Qing Dynasty succeeded in creating the first piece of falangcai porcelain, to present in 2016, the technique lives on to its 300th anniversary. in order to memorialize this special moment in time, we plan to create a limited edition of 300, with 100 released overseas, in order to give those interested in art, porcelain and collecting a chance to own a falangcai piece. These cups represent eternal sincerity and can be handed down from generation to generation.
Sun is leading a team of twenty in creating the cups. From choosing the clay and creating the form, to firing the white clay, painting, firing again and adding color, each cup takes around twenty days to complete. As the processes of decorating and forming the cups is quite complex, only three cups can be placed in the kiln at once, making the yield quite small, but the results are astounding, proven through the ingenuity of 13 years used to revive the falangcai technique lost for two centuries. These gifts can stand the test of time.
Art is boundless. Passion, creativity, commitment, and the persistent pursuit of true art  are shared trait of all human beings. We hope through this crowd funding, everyone can gain an opportunity to appreciate the very best porcelain art and possess something that represents love and an unremitting pursuit of artistic excellence.

Our Values
We are committed to supporting small-batch & family-run wineries. We understand that most of the time people want an easy, affordable bottle of wine to enjoy. We only ask though, regardless of whether or not we reach our goal, that you continue to support craft winemakers. It's as easy as making sure that each 5th bottle of wine you buy comes from a boutique winery or family-run vineyard.
The Short & Sweet (scroll down for 4 more videos!)
The California Wine Exchange is a start-up retail wine shop & tasting room opening near Burbank, California. And as our name suggests, we will specialize in craft & boutique wines from only the Golden State.
That said, helping us raise $5,000 will give us the best start possible by covering some big up-front expenses such as:
Permits & Licenses.
Materials and supplies to turn an empty retail space into a beautiful tasting room.
AND of course...Uncle Sam wants his cut too! We have to pay taxes on the money we raise here!
The photo below is just a possibility of how we would like the interior of our wine shop to appear...  
More About The California Wine Exchange
There are literally thousands and thousands of California wines from small-batch wineries, family-run vineyards, and green-oriented winemakers that you never see on the shelves at your grocery store. Sustainable-farmed vineyards mean their wine costs more, which means big distributors aren't interested. We're going to fix that. In addition, we are going to create an immersive wine tasting experience that will showcase some of these unique wine gems. And part of that experience is removing the stigma of high-falutin', hoity-toityness of wine, and create an environment where even beginner wine drinkers feel like they belong.
Do you like wine like Tyrion likes wine?
 We believe that California wine means to Californians as much as Huntington Beach, Yosemite, The Golden Gate Bridge, Hollywood, and Disneyland. And with over 5,000 winemakers in California alone, it's easy to see that there is a lot of California to love.
And we don't want to be simply four walls & a roof selling fermented grape juice, we want to bring the experience of a California vineyard tasting room to the people of our community. We're going to create an environment that transports our customers' imagination to California wine country. 
Wine itself is an experience in every bottle. Every bottle a story. Each night we will feature a themed tasting events to tell these stories, including, but not limited to: Latino winemakers, Central Coast wines, Women winemakers, Lake County, Pinot Noir & Sauvignon Blanc, Petaluma Gap wines, Black winemakers, Temecula and of course, Napa cabs!
In the following video, Mark goes more in depth about the mission and goals of the California Wine Exchange...  
What We Are Looking For & How You Can Be A Part
We're looking to raise a minimum of $50,000 from the Kickstarter community. As anyone in the wine business will tell you... ""it ain't easy."" And we don't expect it to be. It's long days and a lack of social life that we're in for. You have to have a passion for it. And that we do! Wine is one of those things that connect people in a special way, and opening our store is going to allow us to share our love of California wine with our community.
Permits & Licenses: All of the legal fees, local permits, and state licenses.
Materials & Supplies: As you can see from the photos and our video, we are NOT just going to be four walls and a roof with some wine inside. We want to craft a beautiful environment in which to sample wine! We are skilled enough to do quite a bit of our own labor & installation so the money we raise will mainly go towards raw materials.
Taxes: Many people may not be aware of this, but we have to pay taxes on the money that we raise here on Kickstarter.

900,484008669,"Started this adventure almsot at the beginning of covid. Being home more meant more coffee and we went on the search for light/blonde roast in Edmonton. As we tested different local brands (and some chain store bands) of coffee we quickly realized light roast wasn’t other roasters priority. Not being able to find a light roast we wanted to commit to we began learning how to roast our own beans, then we fell head over heels in the art and science of roasting coffee. Now we are at the point that we want to grow and provide light roast coffee to not just friends and family, the funds will be going straight into that goal. To reach that gaol we need to invest in a larger cofffee roaster and afterburner, bean cooler, other food safe containers and tools, and finally need to upgrade to a shop with more space. "
901,1056497375,"Overview
My name is Angie Rucker, and I want to invite you to be a part of my photography project – “Hollow Bones.” As an artist, I construct scenes to create fictional narratives in the form of painterly, surreal photographs.
Hollow Bones examines the role of women in marriage and the theme of love and hate existing simultaneously. I view this project as a novella told in still photographs. The series portrays the various stages of an unhealthy relationship from the point of view of an unnamed woman living on an unnamed street in an old historic section of Columbus, Ohio. It is an attempt to visually portray incidents and emotions with a model and the use of heavily symbolic objects.  I tend to begin projects that are informed by experiences I have, or those close to me have, and then I look at how those experiences exist on a larger level and in different circumstances.
I won’t be able to begin this project without Kickstarter funds, therefore, I am unable to show any work in progress at this time. However, I did want to show some of my previous work so you can get an idea of the type of images I have created in the past. My work is continually changing and evolving, and this series will take me in an exciting new direction.
    The Plan
I will hire a model and rent this house
for a month, It's an intriguing old house in an historic district of Columbus, Ohio; with hardwood floors, some of which have been painted white,
and large windows, it provides the required light I need since I use only natural lighting for all my images. I plan to transform the rooms of this house into spaces to construct the staged scenes of a relationship’s journey,
as the model engages with various objects as visible metaphors, either organic or items that I create, while she physically changes, to create a heavily symbolic, sequenced, visual narrative.
Why I Chose this Project
I am curious about the reasons why relationships fail and what the stages of that failure might look like. How hate lives with love. How couples relate to one another, how love decays, and how that decay touches all those around them. 
I seek the fulfillment that comes from exploring and photographing human emotion and turning that into something physical. In addition, I feel a desire to take a seemingly cliché or dismal subject and display it in an entirely unique way. 
Finally, I am drawn to the natural shape of the female form. The line of a neck or the curve of a shoulder I feel are inherently beautiful and so I am compelled to infuse my work with femininity.
The Outcome
The final outcome will be a cohesive series of 12-15 digitally photographed, archival pigment prints that I plan to submit to galleries as I seek representation, and also to various organizations offering artist grants, in order to apply for funding for future projects to build my body of work. These prints will be predominantly monochromatic with hints of color creating a surreal quality, as if they were bits and pieces of a dream.
I will be working with a master printer here in Columbus who has printed my museum quality prints for previous shows. The final prints will be on archival quality, cotton rag paper printed with archival inks. 
The Value
So what might be the value in being part of a project like mine? Well, as many have written before me, to make Art. To create something beautiful out of something that might seem quite the opposite. To create something where once there was nothing. To create images that make people stop, think, and reflect. And, most importantly, to evoke emotion and provoke dialogue!
Please share this Kickstarter campaign with your community. Facebook, twitter and emails are a great way to let this project be experienced. With Kickstarter, its all or nothing. Thank you for being a part of "" Hollow Bones"" and supporting my project!

First – my work has been exhibited in multiple galleries and juried exhibitions across the United States (please see my full bio/profile for a list, or better yet, please visit www.angierucker.com where you can view more of my work and bio information) My awards include The Saville Gallery’s Annual Photographic Competition in Cumberland, MD where my image Someone New was chosen as First Place Winner by Juror Kenneth Garrett, Photographer for National Geographic Magazine, Bronze Award Winner of ArtForward’s Online Exhibition where my image Last Leaves of Autumn was chosen by Christa Dix, Director of Wall Space Gallery in Santa Barbara, CA, and The Director's Award for my image Sleeps with Butterflies 2 chosen for the ""Flight"" Exhibition at The Photoplace Gallery in Vermont.
Secondly - my passion to create this series and see it through.  I began as a self-portrait artist - often posing in 20 degree weather wearing very little, as in this image – this is all ice!
or covering myself with clay and volcanic ash while wearing nothing but ace bandages
or blindly running from angry bees that were attracted to the flowers I held, with my head entirely wrapped in cheese cloth
or getting the razor sharp porcupine needle necklace that I made tangled in my dress and around my neck strangling and stabbing me while I changed outfits in the middle of a field
all of which were shot without any assistance. (For more information about the series these photos are from, visit my website angierucker.com).
I am extremely excited about the potential of this project and i know that it will be a very meaningful culmination of thought, emotion, and energy. I am passionate about seeing it actually come to life and want so badly to see it through to the end. I so hope you will take this ride with me.  
Finally, if this project gets funded, I have pledged to contribute 5% of any profits I receive from it to other Kickstarter projects at KickingItForward.org  Thank you!"
902,1274435268,"Our Program
At Now Next Dance we believe in transformational experiences. We also believe that the moving body informs humanity. Our mission is to cultivate leadership, wellness, and creativity in and through contemporary dance. We do this by helping tweens, college dancers, and professional dance artists create a life, emboldened by dance. 
Help us Bridge the Gap this Summer
After five years of running summer workshops that bring together middle school girls, college dance majors, and professional dance artists, we are expanding to provide a life-span approach to mentoring in and through dance. This summer we are offering 4 projects across the country, and we need your help to Bridge the Gap between our fall fundraising and tuition revenue--and our costs.
Help us offer four, meaningful projects this summer! We need to raise $5,000 through this crowd-funding campaign. Where will your dollars go?
-To pay our amazing faculty of dance artists and educators this summer. We have a gap between the money we raised last winter, our tuition revenues, and our costs. Why? Over half of our young dancers and college students are on partial scholarship this summer. This summer we are running programs in NC, TX, SC, and MO and we have dancers attending from all over the country.
-To conduct a series of summer strategy meetings with stakeholders, constituents, and allies, as we seek to refine and enrich our mission and programming.
-To fund travel expenses for our external researcher, an independent dance education scholar who will be studying our program and informing us on what we are doing well or where we are missing the mark, and she'll share her findings with the broader dance research community."

SÉ QUE CONTAMOS CONTIGO."
905,987040778,"Kefir is a traditional fermented beverage with numerous health benefits: but to get the best of it, it has to be fresh – and for this do-it-yourself preparation is the best. Those of you who already know kefir will probably agree that this is a very refreshing, tasty and also healthy beverage.
HOW WE GOT FROM KEFIR TO KEFIRKO  
When a few people who have to keep their minds busy all the time - whether it is making music, design, branding, writing or preparing food - meet, you can be sure something new is bound to emerge. One day we came across kefir, liked its taste and noticed its beneficial effects. As we advocate the DIY principle, we started making kefir at home. Soon we realized that the procedure tends to be quite messy and complicated: jars, sieves, measuring cups, spoons, cloths, lids...milk, kefir grains...no metal, food-safe plastic...just enough of everything for another DIY intervention. This is why we started thinking about a solution that would minimize the number of utensils needed, keep our kitchens tidy, be handy and nice to look at. It took us some time, and since we do not like cheap, half-way solutions, but functional and sustainable products, we finally ended up with the KEFIRKO prototype.  
We tested it and we believe that it can make the lives of kefir-makers a lot easier.
We firmly believe that you, too, will enjoy preparing and consuming your own kefir thanks to KEFIRKO.  
KEFIRKO EXPLAINED
Kefir making requires specific preparation. KEFIRKO is a specifically designed glass jar with two different purpose-specific lids which enables easier kefir-making at home. Put the kefir grains in the liquid of your choice and allow the content to ferment for 24 hours. After that, the grains should be separated from the freshly‑made kefir. KEFIRKO enables optimal fermentation conditions and simplifies the procedure of separating the grains from the kefir at the same time.

KEFIRKO is designed so that every element has a functional purpose, and thus the preparation of kefir is made as simple as possible. Also, the materials used do not react with the contents so the kefir can preserve its unique taste and freshness.
 
MILK AND WATER KEFIR
Both milk and water kefir require kefir grains. For water kefir crystal grains are used, but the basic production principle remains the same.
DELICIOUS KEFIR DISHES
Either fresh or as an ingredient in smoothies, shakes, icecreams, breadspreads, salads, cakes, cookies, pies, puddings, pancakes… Your favourite meal can easily be even more delicious with kefir.
WHY MAKE KEFIR AT HOME
Making kefir by yourself gives you the opportunity to enjoy all the richness and health benefits of the beverage. Since no preservatives are added, you have better control over the quality of your kefir. Compared to the kefir you can buy in stores, the homemade beverage contains a much higher degree of kefir-specific active substances which are important for your health.
WHY DRINKING KEFIR IS GOOD FOR YOU  

Several studies have confirmed the medicinal properties of kefir: it is rich in vitamin B, contains folic acid, easily digested proteins, good bacteria helping your digestion, antimicrobial strains of lactobacilli, etc. Besides its numerous benefits to the gastrointestinal system, other positive effects of kefir have also been accounted for: preventing and treating cancer, lowering the blood pressure, healing the skin after severe burns, and helping people with allergies (and, yes, it can be also consumed by the lactose intolerant).
   
WHERE TO OBTAIN THE GRAINS
Kefir grains are constantly growing and multiplying, and it is common practice to share your extras with others. To help you with sharing we set up the KEFIRHOOD portal, based on the sharing is caring principle, where you can share your extras or obtain fresh grains. You can also share or obtain kefir grains through various social networks where people connect for this purpose.
HOW SENSITIVE ARE KEFIR GRAINS
Kefir grains are living organisms which – just like you – need food to live. But don’t worry. Even the more mobile among you can preserve the grains. During shorter or longer periods of absence, the grains can be stored in a cold place, which will slow down their activity.
MULTIFUNCTIONAL FORM
While your kefir grains are having a rest, your KEFIRKO is waiting for new adventures. You may try growing your own sprouts or experiment and find other yet unknown ways to use it.
STRETCH GOAL #1
If we reach the stretch goal of $40,000, we will add a squeezer for free to each KEFIRKO pack. Now you will be able to squeeze fresh juice directly into your water kefir.
STRETCH GOAL #2
If we reach the stretch goal of $55,000, we will offer you a new reward: the KEFIRKO kit. You can use the large glasses to store your kefir in the refrigerator for secondary fermentation, and in the small one you can store your kefir grains. The glasses can be nested one into another, and finally in the KEFIRKO jar, like Russian dolls. You will also be getting a kitchen cloth.
DETAILS
Unscrew the lid just a tiny bit and the fruit flies will not be able to get inside the jar. V-shaped slots designed to keep the grains of all sizes in.
  KEFIRKO IN COLOURS

While the whiteness of freshly made kefir associates with health and inner peace, an active lifestyle is full of dynamics and vivid colours. This goes hand in hand with the preparation of your own kefir: just pick the KEFIRKO in the colour you like most – so that other members of your household will know that this KEFIRKO is yours and yours only.


We are very proud to announce that the KEFIRKO project was supported by:
 
TIMELINE

  FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE KEFIRKO PRODUCT
The product is designed to allow further upgrades with low-priced accessories that will make the production of other healthy, homemade foods (fresh cheese and whey, butter, buttermilk, etc.) possible.

HELP US OUT

Our aim is to support kefir makers all over the world and also to promote a healthier lifestyle through do-it-yourself food production. Your support would help us in producing the molds needed to manufacture the final product, and in a continued development of the kefirhood.com portal.

REWARDS


KEFIRKO People with an active lifestyle are quick to react and are sure to recognize a good offer, when they see one. So, don’t hesitate and grab our early bird offer!

 Let kefir-making become easy and fun with your own KEFIRKO. And remember, you can choose KEFIRKO in your preferred colour!
 Christmas joys and gifts should not be limited to December only: surprise your family member or friend with a message that they will receive their own KEFIRKO in May 2015.
You are just getting ready to enjoy your fresh, homemade kefir – and then you discover that it is gone. No more! The additional KEFIRKO pack will prevent stress and bring other health benefits. For all!

A special reward for our (online) retail supporters. Later on, the retail price will be $35. Worldwide shipment included.

The Painting Process
The painting process takes time, means, lots of hours of work.
Several very fine layers of paint will be built up over the canvas day by day.
All paintings will be  produced on the highest quality 100% cotton canvas, using high quality oil paints and mediums.
All paintings will be hand signed .Prints will be signed and numbered, before they are carefully packed into rugged mailing tubes along with a certificate and shipped to you..
Cotton Canvas is flexible and suitable for stretching around a wooden frame in case
you decide framed art work make in your local print shop.
The sizes of art work do not include some extra borders, normally 3-5cm each side.
 Risks and challenges
My challenge here is dealing with the bigger size of canvas. Until now I did not
use canvas size more than 90 x90 cm. But I have necessary skills to work it out !
Another challenge is to deal with professional laboratory, meaning: talk through every step of work and be in charge of whole process to get from them what I want - the best possible result !
 Communication with my backers
I would love to hear from you on every issue may happened .I will keep you informon any updates, any event and you can watch videos about my work, which I attend to post regularly .If you have any questions about the Project, please, don’t  be hesitated to ask !

907,467890142,"Hi Everyone!
I'm so honored and delighted to be presented by On the Boards in Northwest New Works. June 9 and 10 @ 8pm on the Mainstage!
The Project
Falling Short is a duet between Shane Donohue and myself. 
I am a trans man and Shane is cis. Together we stand our manhood up against society's rubric for measuring masculinity. Successes and failures abound. Desire and heartbreak wind in and out of our bodies. We're entangled. So similar and so different. 
Being a child of the 90s, I've been looking at those men that I wanted to be, 90s heartthrobs, recalling those daydreams about what it would feel like to live inside their large hard bodies with soft floppy hair. How would it feel for clothes to touch their skin? How would it feel to flex their muscles? How would it feel to be touched while inside their body? Witness our exploration.
Your Support
I've set a goal of $3,500. 
Paying Shane and myself $10/hr for rehearsals. Dancing is a valuable way to spend our time. Valuable to our community and to ourselves. I'd like to value our work by paying us!
Paying our Lighting Designer, Kent Cubbage. He's a masterful artist and deserves to be fairly compensated. 
Paying our photographer. Dillon Webster took our promo shots! He did such an incredible job!! Let's pay him for his work!
Props. We have very fun surprise props that need to be purchased!!
Costumes. Don't worry, we'll only be wearing underwear. Calivin's ;)
Elby Brosch is a trans masculine dancer and choreographer. He began dancing at age 10 because his mom wanted him to do ballet. Dance quickly became a safe haven, a way to connect to a body that felt hard to understand. As gender became confusing, movement became clear. He gained control and intimacy with his body, and learned to process emotion and trauma through movement. Dance has become a vital part of his existence. Now, he choreographs to build connections and understandings from a marginalized view point to the greater community. He distills the trans experience down to what makes us human, and then he offers that to his audiences. Empathy heals wounds and builds connections. He has presented his work at Velocity in a co-produced show, This That & The Other, and Velocity produced shows, Fall Kick Off and Next Fest Northwest. His work has also been presented in Seattle International Dance Festival and Mo-Wave.
Shane Donohue is a Seattle based dance artist currently working with zoe|juniper, Kim Lusk, Alyssa Casey’s Squatch Tanztheater, and Elby Brosch. His performative philosophy derives from an interest in movement and creative practices as they provide him an opportunity to gain new insight on his perception of the world. While studying Dance and Psychology at University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, he received the Incoming Freshman Scholarship in Dance, the Bukolt Family Scholarship, the Chancellor’s Leadership Award, and the Outstanding Graduating Senior Award. Shane is currently a Creative Resident at Velocity Dance Center."
908,758996342,"This June I will be an artist in residence at Studio Kura in Fukuoka, Japan. During the residency I will resume my series of Nocturne drawings that began last summer in Wassaic, NY.
 I am seeking benefactors to assist with funding during this residency in exchange for one of the drawings I will produce while in Japan. Part of my time spent at Studio Kura will be dedicated to production, but I am also looking to liaise with local artists for education in traditional Japanese drawing techniques and paper-making. 
With additional resources (thanks to you!) I will be able to better expand on my Nocturne series. These drawings are each roughly 16” x 20” and are drawn with sumi ink on rice paper, but during the residency I intend on experimenting with other kinds of pigmentation and paper surfaces. The drawings are made at night and drawn “blind”, meaning I don’t look at the drawing while making it. The process is about observation of not only environmental phenomena, but also one of mediation between internal and external psychological space.
In exchange for your kind support of $50, you will receive one of the Nocturnes, signed and dated. For $200 you will receive a framed Nocturne of your choosing. The end of my residency will culminate in an exhibition of one hundred of these drawings in Studio Kura’s gallery. The exhibition title, One Hundred Views of Nothing refers to Hiroshige and Hokusai’s famous  ukiyo-e depictions of Edo and Mount Fuji.

909,376388332,"Friends, Romans, Facebookers, lend me your ideas!
 I will paint 30 paintings in 30 days. The subject will be decided by you! Your inspiration is my motivation.You pitch the ideas and I'll choose one to paint each day. Then I'll post the new painting for you to see the results. It's as simple as that. 
So, challenge me to paint something I've never done before!
Why am I doing this?
I'd like to offer you a rare opportunity to collaborate in the genesis of a work of art, for me to expand my creative horizons, and for us to make original oil paintings available on the average person's budget. That's our goal!
If we can get 20 donations at the $150 level by December 15th, I'll be able to start shipping the 8""x10"" paintings domestically, so they should arrive in time for Christmas.
Otherwise, they will be ready to ship at the end of the project.
Then, I will choose the best pieces to expand upon on 12""x16"" canvases.

Who gets which painting? This will be a lot to juggle, so to be fair it has to be first come, first serve.
 What's the money for?
I'm going out on a limb, using money out of my own pocket to run this project for it's duration because I believe in it that much. If we don't meet the monetary goal, I'll be in quite a predicament!!! What I'm asking is to be reimbursed for my time and expenditure. 
I believe in people, so I believe that you'll help me to be generous to you and many others!
I really can't do it without you, so tell your friends!"
910,400867109,"So this is simple really, each person who pledges £25 will receive a Limited Edition print of my oil painting. This is limited to just 50 prints which are signed by myself (the artist)
So I plan to reach my goal within 30 days and then order the finest quality German Etched prints of my painting to ensure a very close match in colour and a high gsm. The reason for the funding is simply the fact that I cannot afford the costs of printing up front and therefore need the payments first. Please be aware that should I not reach my target, you will not be charged. It's all or nothing everyone ��
Get in there while you can, once all 50 are sold that is it! No more prints will be made. This will ensure that each print holds value to the buyer. 
Thanks for looking! ��"
911,1862193707,"Hello there! We are a film crew from the European Film College in Ebeltoft, Denmark, and we are currently in the process of making one of the biggest films of our year, and it's a non budget. That's why we need your help.  
What are we doing? 
We're raising money for an 8.5 min long short film, which is about a young woman who is afraid of death and tries to escape growing older and ‘decaying’ by taking care of her skin so much that it becomes an obsession. 
We follow the psychological struggles of this woman, Amy, and how she isolates herself and her fear from the world. Eventually her obsession drives her into madness. The story is about the human nature and how sometimes the talent human beings have, realizing that we exist, can work completely against us. It also critiques the beauty standards of the modern society and how young people are pressured into believing that beauty can determine who you are.
What does the money go to? 
The film will be shot in Copenhagen, so the money will mainly be spent on transportation of equipment, actors and our beloved crew. Furthermore the style and tone in the film are very important, and we will use the money on set design, props, costumes, extra lenses so we can achieve the style with extreme close-ups that we want. 
Who are we?
We are an international crew consisting of people from 6 different countries, and we are all students at the European Film College. So without further ado, here we are:

912,1635883507,"Project
By preparing two separate exhibition in the museums of Cleves - the Museum Kurhaus Kleve and the Museum B.C. Koekkoek-House - an insight into the important and fascinating Wörner collection will be given. The collection covers over 500 years of art history, it comprises artworks from the late Medieval times up until modernity, as well as contemporary works from the 20th century.
The collection was given to the two museums after Rose Wörner passed away in 2015. The museums see it as their duty to acknowledge and present the huge legacy which has been given to them. 
Private collection
The  collection is until now mostly unknown. It is made up of over 5000 works of art: Paintings, prints, sculptures, and arts and crafts. 
The most important areas of the collection are: Medieval miniatures and incunabulums, asian art, old master drawings from the Baroque and Rococo, engravings of birds and plants, engravings of historic gardens and Rhine landscapes, Art nouveau vases, classical modern sculptures (Emil Nolde, Käthe Kollwitz, Renee Sintenis, Gerhard Marcks, Ewald Mataré, e.a.), modern and contemporary paintings and prints (Heinz Mack, Hann Trier, Otto Piene, Günther Uecker, Bernhard Schultze, Arnulf Rainer, e.a.)
The Wörner collection is an inheritance which was given to the city of Cleves and its citizens by the two generous collectors. It is the duty of the two museums to present it to the world. We strongly believe that the artworks assembled in the collection are of great value for the whole society and that they will help us to understand our cultural identity.
The Collectors
Rose and Gustav Wörter were famous garden and landscape architects. They were known for their very unique style of perfection in their profession, but art was their real passion in life. They acquired a huge knowledge and understanding, an amazing love and dedication for art. They loved to open their drawers filled with countless of works on paper and presented their artworks to anyone who came into their house to pay them a visit. Their love for art is present in every single piece of the collection.
Exhibition & Publication
Special theme rooms will bring back the atmosphere of Rose and Gustav Wörner's home and will give an insight to the visitors of the exhibition, what it was like to visit them at their house. There was this rule at the collector's home, that all works needed to be looked at in an order, one piece after the other. This way of showing the artworks inspired us to present them in small separate rooms, one might think of the French ""Salon"" of the 18th and 19th century.
In addition to that there will be a catalogue of the exhibition, which intends to present and describe the unbelievable bandwidth of this amazing collection.
Target group
The exhibition reaches out to people of all ages. There will be workshops and many other very interesting projects for kids and teenagers, with the aim to develop an understanding of the significance and importance of the collection. For adults and college students several different lectures will take place which will elaborate on the most important areas of the collection, like for e.g. the medieval miniatures or the master drawings from the Baroque. Furthermore there will be guided exhibition tours as well as exhibition tours exclusively guided by the curators. All activities will contribute to the understanding of the exhibition and its exhibits, its organization and realization, all in all to the understanding of the whole project in its entirety."

914,1464108093,"Why are we here? A 2017 Dragon Calendar!
    The calendar is comprised of all 12 months, with one of my favorite dragon paintings for each month and a separate all new unreleased cover image. 10 of the months are completed, with 2 more and the cover left to finish. The drawings of the last 3 images are completed, along with the color palettes. I have chosen to create these 3 new paintings so the calendar will have fresh, never seen before work and so backers can see the process as it happens. I will be updating all the backers with these new paintings as I move through the process of finishing them throughout the month this project is running. Each dragon has been painted in my signature style using watercolor, with each page of the calendar being designed by myself. Rarely will you get the chance to own a calendar that is completely created by the artist. Here is the only place to get a calendar where the artwork is not only created by me, but the calendar is also designed by myself from the ground up. 
     Calendars are printed by the same small press that printed the 2015 Dragon Calendar, their quality is stunning! Each image is bright and lush, every page will be full color with the artwork extending over both pages of every month. The numbers will be easy to read, and the day squares amply sized for writing notes and special dates. The Dragon Calendar will be 8.5 inches x 11 inches when closed and fold out to a full poster size of 11 inches x 17 inches when hanging. The pages are printed on 80# text paper, with full UV High Gloss Finish and a heavy 100# cover. Each Dragon Calendar is stapled in the middle and will have a prepunched hole, ready to hang! I’m excited to be working with the same small print press, they came out beautifully and will again!
Why Dragons? 
     They are one of the few truly universal icons and images of man kind. Every culture as far back as we can study have believed in Dragons. They had different meanings to different peoples, but always they are there. Some created the universe and our world, some created the lakes, rivers and oceans that surround us, and others the mountains and landscapes we call home. Yet still others sought to destroy, and became Gods of chaos or even death. Religion, philosophy, myth and even history all carry shadows of the Dragon. In our days the dragon still has a firm grip on our waking and sleeping minds. Through the written word, movies, games and advertisements Dragons still fly though our imaginations and sing in our hearts. And now, you can experience and enjoy them in this calendar.

917,2091458943,"FREE KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE FIGHTER UNLOCKED! 
In celebration of Lost in the North Woods becoming my most-funded campaign out of my 11 campaigns, I have unlocked Leshiy, a free Kickstarter-exclusive figure that will be included with every copy of Lost in the North Woods from this campaign.
Here is a full list of everything I was able to add to this campaign:
This is also your chance to pick up the first Gatefall expansion AND Gatefall: Chapter One if you missed it! The Seline and Piggy expansion is available as an add-on that you can only get on Kickstarter!
A new gate has opened into The North Woods, a location set in a world of ancient magic and dark history, where Travelers and Dwellers fight for survival. 
Lost in the North Woods is the first Art Series expansion to Gatefall, and features amazing characters and sculpts by Alexei Konev. The series pays tribute to elements of Slavic lore while showcasing the unique character concepts that are a hallmark of Alexei's beautiful work.
 This expansion features three new fighters from this world: Volhv, Zimorodok, and The Drowned Warrior. Each fighter brings new abilities to the worlds of Gatefall, and this team is a lot of fun to play.
I knew when I made this game that I wanted to work with artists to give them a place to show their work in a fun and unique way. I am very honored to have Alexei, Gatefall's original artist, be the first of those artists to take us to their own world.
Lost in the North Woods requires Gatefall: Chapter One to play. Chapter one can be added to your pledge in this campaign. You can check out the original campaign for Chapter One here! 
Gatefall: Chapter One.
HUGE FIGURES
These figures are nearly triple the size of standard tabletop miniatures. This scale is reminiscent of the scale used for toy figures (100mm scale), and provides the same level of emotional connection to the design. That connection is elevated by the amount of detail and personality in each figure. 

THE PERFECT CANVAS FOR PAINTERS
Gatefall's scale provides painters with sculpts that are a pleasure to paint. Huge surfaces combined with sharp intricate details and realism provide you with endless opportunities for creative expression and execution.

SUPERB CASTS
Eastar has been manufacturing miniatures for years, and their dedication to excellence shows in their work. These are solid figures with minimal mold lines cast in durable gray PVC plastic. Details are shatter resistant and sturdy. The same factory manufactured Gatefall: Chapter One, and here is what Chapter One's backers had to say:
Chapter One has a 9.1 rating on Board Game Geek!

Volhv
In the Western Swamp there is death and decay, but also life. Volhv knows of all these things, the call of the solitary beasts, the rot of necrosis and that which feeds upon it, the movement and dance of the eternal stars and pale moon. Volhv can whisper to the dead, waking them from their slumber. He can tend to the living, knitting skin and bone together that was sundered in battle.


Zimorodok
The Southern Forests are a majestic natural cathedral of cyclopean trees, beautiful and unearthly sights and smells, and the enticing songs of birds that are too alluring and perfect for human ears. Travellers should heed the advice of the common folk and avoid listening to this music, lest they follow it to their death. Zimorodok's pot is filled with the flesh of such unfortunates, and her clothes are made from their skins and adorned with their bones.

The Drowned Warrior
In rare ages the sea is filled with spite and woe and wages war upon the land, waves claiming the earth and devouring the people and creatures living above the water. The Drowned Warrior was once a mortal man, but the kelpies and water maidens took his heart, chained it in iron and replaced it with an urchin. Now he is the rage of the sea, bringing horror and death to land dwellers for his cold wives far below the waves.


(Lost in the North Woods box design subject to change.)
I have an atypical approact to stretch goals. You can read all about my thoughts on them here in this update.

But the basic idea is: I constantly evaluate the performance of the campaign, then try to add as much as I can. Sometimes I can add things for free (shown as ""$0"" above), and sometimes the campaign's success allows us to produce something new that is too expensive to produce to add for free, so it is added as an add-on right in the campaign. This is a new option, as Kickstarter just launched the beta of in-campaign add-ons.

Some campaigns charge for a ""Kickstarter Version"" or a ""Deluxe Version"" that they then add things to, but I would rather have you choose what you actually want and don't want.
You can read about how to access the add-ons page in the FAQ.

 Paid add-ons now available in this campaign:
3-and-4-player gate pack: $5 for the set
Upgraded Metal Tokens (see FAQ): $15 
6 sculpted SwampZombies: $15 
Danika and Iva: $15 
Piggy and Seline: $18 
Extra copy of Lost in the North Woods: $35 
Extra copy of Gatefall Chapter One: $45
You can see descriptions of those items in the add-ons section (check the FAQ for instructions on how to get to it).


What's in the box?
Lost in the North Woods includes three new figures, standard Gatefall character boards for each figure, three health markers, six swamp zombie tokens, four drowned tokens, four grabbed tokens, and one new game board. Token configuration is subject to change.The cards, gate, dice, and an opposing team from Chapter One are needed to play.
How do you use it with Gatefall: Chapter One?
Simply replace one of the teams in Chapter One with the North Woods team, and you're all set!  You can also use the triangle gates (available as an add-on in the pledge manager) to play a 3-player game using all three teams of fighters.
FUTURE EXPANSIONS
There are a LOT of expansions coming. Want to drown a triceritops with The Drowned Warrior? You got it. Want to send some swamp zombies to take down a space ship? That's coming too. Want to see how a samurai does against a mech? Just wait. 
I'll post all about the future of this game in updates during the campaign!
Here is a video explaining how gatefall is played. The dice look a lot better now (this was for the Chapter One Kickstarter). And Weapons/Items are finally making it into Team Mode.
Gatefall Chapter One was awarded the Dice Tower Seal of Approval!
Dice Tower Seal of Approval is a trademark of The Dice Tower, LLC and is used with permission.
 NOTE: Gatefall is designed to be modular for fans of different genres and fans of different complexities in games. The core game has a lot of depth to its simplicity, but a lot more is coming, including:

Many, MANY More Teams
Gatefall is a strategic miniatures game of tactics, deck building, and resource management. Here are the basic steps:
A two player game will take around 60-90 minutes.
The game board is modular, which will allow you to play with 3 or more players (with the  purchase of a pack of differently-shaped rift boards), and will allow future expansion teams to fight the current teams.
Here is an example using the board from a future expansion:
Here is a Chapter One unboxing fromThe Dice Tower:
Alexei Konev is an artist with over 10 years of experience in the video game and tabletop game industries. He specializes in 3D sculpts and character design.
Jack Dire is the creator of Gatefall, Superfight, Red Flags, and You've Got Problems.
Jack has run 6 successful Kickstarter campaigns since 2013, including those for Superfight and Red Flags.
Shipping will be paid NEXT YEAR through the pledge manager. 
This lets us figure out exactly how much it will cost to get it to you after we know how big the final box is and how much it weighs. That way we do not undercharge you, or (worse) overcharge you.
Here are some estimates about what shipping will cost:
US AND CANADA: $10
EU AND AUSTRALIA: $15
REST OF THE WORLD: $20-50
If, when shipping is quoted later, you are unable to pay the amount quoted, we will happily refund your pledge.

The Story
After flirty encounters over americanos and banana bread, Lilly agrees to go on a date with Titus - a regular at the cafe she works at. Despite a promising start, things quickly take an unexpected turn. It seems that some things are better left as a fantasy, and some people's fantasies are other people's nightmares.
Look Book image
Project
The whole team of Regulars would be extremely grateful for your generosity towards this project. We are raising funds for the shoot and post-production, aiming big and applying for lots of film festivals.  Covid has been a big knockback for our industry and especially the indie film scene. 
Look Book image
We are very excited to have such a fantastic cast and crew behind it. Lauren Mackenzie will be directing this project. We are very excited to have her on board as she previously has won awards for her work. She has such an incredible vision and natural artistic eye and will really capture the complexity of these characters Titus and Lilly played by Tom Glynn-Carney and Tegen Short

This piece was first performed in December 2018 as a one women show and has further developed this into a short film. I have been working on adapting this and am now so overwhelmed that the ball is finally rolling we are finally producing it!  As a young woman in this industry, I am determined to make and produce female stories providing opportunities for people to showcase their work. 
Tegen Short
I am excited to be able to work with such fantastic people on a script that really includes all elements of cinema.

And now we're gearing up for a much broader collaboration, and need YOUR help! This March, we we will be accompanying members of a wonderful local non-profit organization, Project Schoolhouse, to a remote mountainside village in rural Nicaragua. While they oversee construction of a new school building, we will be working with the children of this community. We will have supplies and lesson plans, but more than anything we want to celebrate the imagination with kids who otherwise might not have the time, space, and encouragement to create art.
Two years ago, Joelle worked with the children of another village, which planted the seed for this project. She brought supplies, lesson ideas, and a Spanish dictionary, and helped initiate a temporary art program in the community's school.
Over the course of a week, the kids gained confidence in their creations. The work that the children produced bore some strong similarities to that of kids here in Austin. They drew their homes, their friends, their families, their animals. They might have drawn chickens and cows instead of cats and dogs, but they still depicted the things they see around them.
The week ended with an outdoor art show at the construction site of the new school. Paintings, drawings, and collages were hung on the side of the old school house, and along the surrounding fence.
This year, some things will remain the same. We will still bring art supplies and lesson ideas, and encourage the kids to try new materials, including some that they see every day. Who knew that taking a machete to banana leaves could create perfect palettes?
This year, we want to continue the experience after we leave Nicaragua. Our feature project will be a collaboration between Austin and Nicaraguan youth. Words provided by Austin children will be paired with Nicaraguan students' pictures, and vice versa. These pages will be printed and bound, and two communities that may never meet in person, will meet via their creation.
What we look forward to most is sending copies of this book back to Nicaragua, to a rural farming community that has few picture books to begin with. We can only imagine their delight when they receive copies of something that THEY created, and when they find their own names, words, and pictures paired with the same from would-be peers in Austin. These are communities with no electricity, and therefore no refrigerators on which they can hang their sons' and daughters' latest crayon drawings. We think and hope that these books and their contents will become heirlooms, a source of pride for the children and their families.
We have a generous sponsor for our art supplies (thank you!). We are donating our time and most travel expenses. So, we are looking for some assistance with our plane tickets, the cost of printing and framing photos for display, and of course, the production of the picture book. The more backers, the more copies we can print. Any money made beyond our goal will further the promotion and display of this book and the kids' visions. Whether you give $1 or $100, every bit helps, and we are so grateful to you all for spreading the word and helping to make this happen."
920,949372279,"Say hello to your new favorite tank, the re-engineered bra top designed for smaller-busted women -- a sophisticated and versatile basic that's anything but basic. You can wear it at home lounging, at work, during a night on the town, or at a yoga class in between.  As a comfortable work-from-home piece, it doesn't get any better.
Years in the making, we’ve broken the boundaries between the latest advances in activewear technology, precision intimates manufacturing and high-quality everyday wear. The Free Reign seamless Everyday Tank with integrated, buttery soft, custom-molded cups designed for A and B sizes provides just the right amount of coverage, support and shape to take women everywhere their day takes them. Best of all, no bra needed.
We've completed prototyping, wear testing and pilot production. With your help, Free Reign can fund our first run of the Everyday Tank Top in two colors and six sizes.

You no longer need to choose between bras too thin they show your headlights, push-ups that are overly padded or sports bras that flatten. You can say goodbye to uncomfortable underwire, sagging bra straps and frustrating removable cups that make you crazy.
To get our product just right, we worked with skilled designers who have years of experience developing innovations in bras, sports bras, and seamless apparel at major intimates and activewear brands. We went through dozens of prototypes and fit tests until we developed PERFECT modern everyday essentials for smaller-busted woman – light in support, comfortable to wear all day, and shape that doesn’t conform to any standard of beauty but their own. So great, it feels like a second skin against the body.
You’ll fall in love with the clean look and unconstrained feel of the all-in-one tank.
We've taken the iconic go-to tank and everyday bra and given you the best of both worlds, the bra and tank in one. Our design features lightly padded molded cups engineered to contour to the unique shape of smaller busts. With just the right amount of support and construction, you'll barely feel like you're wearing a bra.
The Free Reign Everyday Tank Top is the perfect go-to tank for work and play. We all gravitate to a tank as part of our daily uniform, and this modern essential will pair across your existing wardrobe. Worn alone, or with your favorite leather jacket, power suit, or denim shorts, it makes dressing easy.
In a world of endless consumption, we're making a wardrobe staple designed for versatility and longevity, so you need less and can do more with what you already have.
We're mindful of the environment and have chosen TENCEL™ yarns because they are made from tree pulp, a renewable resource from forests that are certified as sustainably managed by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). Ancient, endangered, and high-conservation value forests are off limits. Not all our materials, especially our molded foam cups, are as green as we want them to be. Free Reign is closely tracking materials science and will continue to push boundaries to lighten our product footprint.
We met when we were seven years old -- before we ever knew the purpose of a bra – and have been best friends ever since. Across the decades, we tumbled around as tomboys, confided through love and career choices, and served as each other’s wedding witnesses. We also grumbled a ton about how hard it is to find a good bra.
All we asked for was a comfortable bra with a little support and coverage. What we got was push-ups, padding and underwire to be someone we were not. As smaller-busted women, the difference between what we needed and what the market offered was wider than the Continental Divide.
Feeling completely misunderstood and underserved inspired us to create Free Reign – a line of ultra-comfortable wardrobe essentials that celebrate active lifestyles and natural beauty.
We aren’t just offering a variation on the theme – the way other brands design for the middle of the market and expect it to work for everybody. We design our apparel for the A and B cup woman. We know our customer. We are her."
921,843566509,"Kerf Boxes
So, what is a kerf box?  A kerf is a slit made by a tool that is typically the width of the tool's cutting edge.  In this case, the kerf is the width of a laser beam.  By making a series of short alternating kerfs, you can create a living hinge in thin flexible materials like wood.  Each of our kerf boxes use this method to create a single piece that is both the top and bottom on the box.  Our boxes open and close much like a bound book.  We also use a sliding latch that snaps open and closed, so no fear that the box will accidentally open during travel.  
Kerf Box Styles
 We are currently offering out kerf boxes in four different styles and sizes.
Four different kerf box styles
The Spell Box - This box has an integrated spell tracker on the top of the lid and enough storage in the box to hold two small dice bags with sets of nine 12mm spell dice.  The box will ship with one set of dice (your choice) and a small dice bag to hold them.  Exterior size (108mm x 87mm x 27mm) and interior Size (94mm x 72mm x 15mm). A little interior space will be lost to the natural curve of the box hinge and the sliding box latch.  If you are a Pathfinder player, check out the add-on section for a 10-dice version. 
The Dice Box - This box is big enough to hold several sets of loose dice, a bag with a single set of 12 dice, or the optional 12 dice foam insert.   This box will ship with a 3"" - 4"" dice bag by default. Exterior size (108mm x 87mm x 32mm) and interior Size (94mm x 72mm x 25mm).  A little interior space will be lost to the natural curve of the box hinge and the sliding box latch.
The Mini Dice Box - This box is sized to hold a 12 dice set of loose dice, a bag with a single set of 7 dice, or the optional 7 dice foam insert.   This box will ship with a 3"" - 4"" dice bag by default. Exterior size (108mm x 62mm x 32mm) and interior Size (94mm x 48mm x 25mm).  A little interior space will be lost to the natural curve of the box hinge and the sliding box latch.
The Character Box - This box is 35mm deep and should hold your 25/28/30mm minis perfectly or use it to carry your larger 30mm D20s.  This box has an optional foam insert and will ship with a 3""-4"" dice bag by default. Exterior size (88mm x 67mm x 42mm) and interior Size (75mm x 52mm x 35mm).  A little interior space will be lost to the natural curve of the box hinge and the sliding box latch.

Black Walnut Kerf Boxes
Cherry Kerf Boxes
Mahogany Kerf Boxes
Maple Kerf Boxes
UV Printed Boxes
UV printing is a form of digital printing that uses Ultra Violet light to immediately cure the ink as it is being printing.  This allows for beautiful and vibrant colors on substrates such as wood.  Our UV Printed boxes use a Baltic Birch Plywood and graphics are printed directly on the wood prior to being cut.  We will start with 6 graphic options for the UV printed kerf boxes.  The prints look best on the Spell and Dice Boxes, but can also be used for the Mini and Character Boxes.
UV Printed Kerf Boxes
 UV Graphics Options
 Below are the available options for your UV Printed boxes.  If you choose a UV Printed box, you will select your graphic during the Reward Survey after the campaign has completed.
UV Graphics Options
Stained Boxes

Current stain options include:  Ebony, Espresso, Dark Grey, and Bright Purple.  These look great in any of the kerf box styles.  
Stained Kerf Boxes

Pricing
There are four box styles (Spell, Dice, Mini Dice, and Character) and three base materials (Hardwood Veneers, UV Printed, and Stained) to choose from.

925,1838903317,"  PonyBabe is an ethical fashion label, dedicated to providing women with comfortable, multi-use styles.  We use only eco-friendly textiles and are manufacturing in Brooklyn NY, USA.
Our first collection is the 24 Hour Outfit: A wrap, racerback tank top, cardigan, and pants... all meant to be mixed, matched, and worn on repeat. 
We're raising money to fund our first production run and launch PonyBabe with a strong start. In exchange for your pledge, you'll receive the styles shown here at below-retail value.  Your investment contributes directly to the growth of a more sustainable fashion industry!
                  Each piece in the collection has been designed with function in mind, and finished with details that ensure a beautiful presentation.
The pants are gathered with 36 delicate pleats (18 in front, 18 in back.)  This luxurious detail guarantees that they can be dressed up or down.  The waistband in sturdy elastic, allowing you to adjust a higher or lower fit as preferred.  In addition, the ankle cuffs keep your pant legs from dragging, and also make yoga class a tangle-free experience.
The Racerback Tank Top is finished with a stitched binding, which helps to prevent the neck and armholes from stretching out. The racer silhouette means that you won't be pulling your straps up all day. This one stays put as a base layer or as a workout top.
The cardigan has an ample shawl panel that can be styled in so many different ways: Loose and open, tied in front or back, or draped across the neck. It doubles as an on-the go nursing cover, and styles perfectly as an evening cover-up or coffee-run top layer.
The wrap has a stitched edge, and is surprisingly warm considering its lightweight feel. It can be worn as a shawl, a scarf, a nursing cover, a head wrap... the possibilities are endless! It's perfect for staying comfortable on a long flight, or wrapping up as the sun sets after a day at the beach.
PonyBabe's styles are designed to fit on the relaxed side.  The XS/S/M/L sizing range allows you to size up or down depending on the amount of ease you prefer. The models in the photos below are all wearing a size S.  Take a look and see how the same size looks on different bodies:

 *You will choose your sizes and colors by survey after the campaign is complete.
PonyBabe is a woman-owned, American made label. A commitment to ethics, sustainability, and transparency is the heart of our brand. This motivates us to share the details of our supply chain.
The first collection is made of a super soft blend of  55% organic cotton and 45% bamboo, two fibers that have a reduced environmental impact, when compared to conventional, mass-market options. We source the fabric from Kendor Textiles, a company that is committed to the growth of sustainable practices.  Elastic for the pants is USA-made and sourced from Trim Lab, a New York City-based supplier that caters to small fashion labels.
The fabric is machine washable and can be machine dried as well. When possible, we recommend line drying, or laying flat to dry... Save your clothes and save the Earth!
Special note: this fabric has a slubby knit texture and is slightly sheer. If you are concerned about your undergarments showing through, go for the darker colors (black or stormy blue.)
The 24 Hour Outfit is being manufactured in Brooklyn, New York, USA. We've partnered with Dynotex, a leading production facility for better-market knitwear. They are supportive of independent designers, and have been a fixture in the New York City fashion industry for over 16 years.
We're using recycled, biodegradable, and environmentally friendly products for everything from clothing labels and hangtags, to mailers and shipping stickers. At every step of the process, we are looking for ways to create less waste and we encourage our customers to re-purpose packing materials.
PonyBabe recognizes that the price tag of ethical fashion can often be a reason for customers to feel that they have no choice but to opt out. We want to lower the barrier to entry, and to make better, fairer options available to more people. With this in mind, all PonyBabe email newsletter subscribers will receive exclusive access to steeply discounted pre-sales when new styles are ready for market.

926,161879610,"For the past 11 months Sarah Council Dance Projects (SCDP) has been hard at work on our newest project: Deep Water, an evening of dance that focuses on women found on the margins of society; exploring ideas that relate to poverty, exploitation, gender and survival. 
Deep Water includes the expansion of two current SCDP works, Shadowlands and Staring at Stones.
Shadowlands, a work for five women, seeks to expose the world of human trafficking and modern day slavery, drawing inspiration from stories of trafficking survivors. Staring at Stones takes a look at my southern roots by exploring the culture of the Appalachian Mountains through the words of several female poets from the region, traditional ballads, stories from my Great Grandma Lena and recorded memories from native, Lou Crites. 
Deep Water will be presented by Gowanus art + production on Oct. 24th at The Green Building in Brooklyn. Next, we will be taking it down south to Kentucky where it will be presented by the Glema Mahr Center for the Arts. Deep Water includes performances by Liz Beres, Melissa Brading, Sarah Brown, Sarah Pope and Aya Wilson and features the original music of Greg Heffernan, Bruno Augusto and Kentucky based Carla Gover and Anna Roberts Gevalt 
With our premiere performance less than 8 weeks away, we are in the last stages of creation. This cast, of fantastically talented and generous dance artists, has worked tirelessly with me to bring this project into being. 
And that’s where I need your help…Please help me compensate these 5 artists for all their investment of time and passion to make Deep Water happen! 
Our goal is to raise $1,550 to be used to pay performer stipends for our performance of Deep Water on Oct. 24th at the Green Building. Please consider giving to this effort, no amount is too small, and please come and see what we've been up to. We would love to share Deep Water with you!

About SCDP:
Sarah Council is a choreographer based in Astoria Queens and the artistic director of Sarah Council Dance Projects (SCDP).

In 2007 she founded SCDP as a platform to create emotionally and physically honest dance performance works. These dances explore and reflect life's poignant moments – from the beautiful to the tragic, the curious to the absurd. Drawn from a collection of personal experiences, research and observations, Council's choreography flows between clarity and abandon. Aesthetically interested in the specific, her work uses articulate movement and authentic expression to construct images that provoke thought, conjure memory and capture imaginations. 
The creation of Deep Water has been made possible in part by the Queens Council on the Arts with public funds from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs in partnership with the City Council. Additional funding for the creation of Deep Water also been made possible by the Puffin Foundation."
927,2143648774,"Dance is a tricky beast in the digital age. 
There is inspiration everywhere you look, and the dance world is inundated with artists doing brilliant things all across the board. I think, however, that the full potential of the digital media has yet to be tapped. 
That's not to say there isn't PLENTY of dance on YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook, and all the rest. There's performance videos, rehearsal footage, behind the scenes bits, clips from the classroom, and yes even the occasional bootleg video shot from the balcony on an iPhone (but shh... we won't tell). But there is a serious lack of concert dance being created and cultivated SPECIFICALLY for the handheld screen. 
That's where we step in.
READY - a Dance Film
READY will be a foray into the combination of concert dance and digital media. 
While dance is, in many ways, more accessible than ever before, it is rarely tailored specifically for, let's say the screen of an iPhone or a laptop. There is a LOT lost in translation when viewing a taped performance that originally took place on a stage. So what if we cut out the middle man? 
I am very interested in the concept of developing concert choreographic works that are created, performed, and distributed with the acute intention of being watched digitally. That's not to say that this isn't already happening- it certainly is. There are some truly great dance innovators who, like me, want to create a highly creative and artistic experience for digital audiences around the world. The more art there is, and the more accessible that art is, the better. Right? Right! 
READY will utilize and contribute to this burgeoning type of accessibility to concert dance. We want there to be MORE dance, MORE access, MORE support for creative endeavors; I truly believe that projects like READY can help sustain the visibility and appreciation of concert dance.
The film would provide a viewing experience that is free of charge and available at the audience's convenience. No 8pm curtain times or expensive tickets for seats as high up as the chandeliers. You should have fine art at the ready (pun!) in the kitchen, at the office, on the crosstown bus, at your sister's wedding... Doesn't matter! The point is, it's up to you!
So... Who Are We?
A key component of this film will be the involvement of high-caliber collaborators across various disciplines.
Samuel Asher Kunzman (hey, that's me!) will choreograph READY. I'm a dancer and choreographer based in NYC who has presented work at major festivals and venues throughout New York as well as received commissions from notable institutions including The Ailey School and the New Jersey Dance Theatre Ensemble. My last major endeavor was in August of 2014, in which I conceived, created, and premiered ""4 Stories,"" an evening of 4 brand new works that I choreographed over the course of 3 weeks. It might interest you to know that ""4 Stories"" was largely a success due to the support of-- Kickstarter! So this isn't my first time at bat... But enough about me!
Sarah Daley will be dancing in READY. Sarah is currently in her 5th season with the world-renowned Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre. She has been noted for her ""smooth movement and subtle intelligence"" (Dance Magazine 2014: On the Rise), and has danced leading roles in a vast array of the ballets in Ailey's repertoire. She's a captivating performer, shockingly versatile, and a self-described explorer. Her unique presence and beauty alone are sure to make READY a must-watch.
Nel Shelby Productions will be the videography team behind READY. The Emmy-nominated team at NSP is one of the top names in dance videography. A company fueled by devotion to dance, every member of their team has training in movement and understands the fundamentals and components that bring a choreographer's vision to life. Having filmed more than 700 dance events and performances, they are uniquely qualified to bring READY to its most professional and polished culmination.
Christopher Duggan will be photographing READY, both the performance and behind the scenes moments to really preserve the day. With 10+ years of experience as a dance photographer in NYC and at Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, Christopher has mastered the art of photographing fleeting, meaningful moments that happen in the blink-of-an-eye. 
Mark Gieringer will design the costumes for READY. Mark is an experienced and creative designer. He is also a dancer with Ballet Hispánico, so he knows all about what a costume needs to capture movement and make a dancer feel comfortable yet glamorous.
Where Will Your Donations Go?
As I mentioned earlier, this film will be distributed and available FREE of charge, so READY will not be for profit at all.
That being said, a LOT of hard work goes into a gorgeous and meaningful final product. As the choreographer and creator of this project, I will not personally be receiving any money. But it is incredibly important to me that all the collaborators on this project are paid for their talent, time, and efforts.
80% of all funds raised will go towards paying Ms. Daley, Mr. Gieringer, Mr. Duggan, and the team at Nel Shelby Productions (Director, camera people, editors in post-production) for their collaborative contributions to helping me realize my vision.
Keep in mind that the artists will not just be paid for their time the day of the shoot. There is extensive work to be done leading up to and after the filming. I'm sure you'll agree with me that they deserve sufficient compensation!
The Remainder of the budget will be allocated for
Permits & Licenses to ensure that we are able to film in the locations of our choosing and to acquire the rights to the music to which READY will be performed.
Studio Rentals because we need a place to rehearse and create the film before we actually film it!
We'll be rehearsing and filming in mid-May with plans to have the final video released in July!
THANK YOU
Thank you for taking the time to read this. Your consideration means The World to us, and this would truly not be possible without your generosity and support of the arts."

One day I was looking through my closet and noticed that I didn't really have so many long sleeve shirts. I had short sleeve t-shirts that I wore with a sweatshirt, but not really so many long-sleeve tees.
So I headed to the interweb to buy some more long sleeve shirts but not one store had what I was looking for. I was looking for a long sleeve t-shirt with a cool graphic across the chest. But what I found was that most long sleeve shirts were either boring old solid colors with no design or graphic, or they had an outlandish graphic that sprawled across the entire shirt. I wanted a happy medium, and I couldn't find one.
I couldn't believe what I was seeing, why doesn't one store have what I am looking for?
So one night I was hanging out by my artistic friend Andrea's place and looking at her photos that she took for her photography class, and the words just came out: ""I want to put your photos on long sleeve shirts."" And just like that, Aedran was started.
We picked out some photos, researched shirt-printers, and pretty soon we had our first apparel line.
Now as much as we hate to say it, the old adage holds true, and in order to make money, you have to spend money, and so we are looking to you-people of Kickstarter- to help us provide young men with a long sleeve shirt that isn't just a skin-coverer, but rather a fashion statement.
We are looking to build our brand through intense branding and marketing to the college market. The money we raise from this will go towards building our website, photoshoots, and paying for the setup costs of selling on location at different colleges.
We hope to one day become a large brand so that we can hire those who have a passion for art but struggle finding a good job."

“Science allows us to see what our eyes cannot.” -Neil deGrasse Tyson
But it doesn't always seem that way, especially when we flip through pages upon pages of technical jargon and hard-to-decipher figures in scientific journals. As a result, science is too often perceived as either too difficult to understand or too boring to care about. 
OUR SOLUTION
We want to illuminate what science has the power to show us. We want to peel back the layers of jargon that separate the public from science and uncover the universal truths that are essential to humanity. We want to present science the way it’s supposed to be shown: exciting, cutting-edge, and accessible. We want the International Collegiate Science Journal (ICSJ). 
WHAT IS THE ICSJ?
The International Collegiate Science Journal is a revolutionary publication with a mission to translate science from obscure to captivating. We will write exciting articles explaining why our brain forgets names of people we just met, why it rains diamonds on Saturn, how you can travel to the Caribbean in a second through virtual reality, how we may be able to live for 200 years in the near future, and other interesting topics that you will want to read. Through an online and print magazine, we will create an environment where anyone can uncover science and discover all that it can do. This is not just a journal. This is ICSJ. Visit our FB page here!
WHO ARE WE?
We are a group of undergraduate college students representing nine successful and established undergraduate science journals at some of the world’s top universities. We come from diverse majors and backgrounds, and all share a common passion for making science accessible to the public.
JOIN IN!
Help us get this project started! We need funds to launch our website, print the publication, and pay for shipping fees. We will spend $500 on our website, and $3,000 on the initial printing and shipping fees. 
But we don't want to stop there! If we get additional funding, we will host a science communication conference and launch event for our magazine to bring university undergraduates together. We want to invite a panel of science communicators, hold science workshops, and invite a keynote speaker like Neil deGrasse Tyson or Bill Nye."

934,984680617,"WHY NOW?
Hi I'm Robin B, a licensed curl specialist. In my salon, I often hear stories about hair. This much you may expect in a salon, but the stories go deeper than the hair itself, deeper than any style or look. My clients often tell me how meaningful their hair is to them, what it represents in their view of themselves and how it connects to their whole identities.
A major cornerstone of every culture, hair is never just hair – as Nia, the main character in my book God Created Me Coily, is starting to realize.
My book follows Nia, a smart and curious young girl, as she asks BIG questions about her hair – like, why is my hair coily and curly?
THE PROBLEM
Many children of color, grow up their entire lives feeling ""UGLY"" in the United States. 
They look in the Mirror and they HATE who they SEE
They lack self-confidence and self-worth
 They Struggle for Years in their Careers and with their Families (I see it everyday in my Salon) 
So I posed the question of why? Why is it that our children feel UGLY because their ""hair isn't straight"" and Skin is not White? This is a SERIOUS PROBLEM in the United States. When I looked deeper, this is what I found.  See the statistics below:
According to Lee and Low Books  “In the last 24 years, only 13% of Children’s Books contain multiracial content, even though 37% of the US population are People of Color.” There are more ""Animal and White"" Characters in Books than any other race in 2018.  Often because our children don't see themselves being represented in toys and books they often think they are not worthy enough to be represented. In the future this  leads to self-doubt and lack of confidence that follows them well into adulthood in regards to their identity.   Clearly, the Industry has failed us, lets not allow  for the industry to fail our children. 

Leading Psychologists have mentioned often :""Kids that hate themselves will grow up to hate others."" 
 (YOU deserve to be REPRESENTED in the Industry)
 THE SOLUTION
I have written this book in response to the self-acceptance challenges I know many young girls face as they go through their childhoods. As well, I have written it in response to the distinct lack of Black characters in children's books and the distinct lack of Black dolls with hi-texture hair in the toy market. Our Story with Representation Matters in 2020.

The message of my book is clear and straightforward: embrace yourself, your authentic self, and discover your own creativity and uniqueness. By combining story and representation we create a world where your child learns and feels empowered by their identity” Passionate about beauty, tech and entrepreneurship, I am the founder of Coil Beauty. I want the God Created Me Coily Book Series + Doll Experience to motivate your girls to pursue their grandest dreams.
Long-term, I would also like to launch my own line of diverse dolls through Coil Beauty, but to get to that point, I need to be able to hit my minimum order goals on the first edition of the ""Nia"" Collection Dolls. This is the priority of the crowdfunding campaign, pushing funding over the edge so that I can cover those costs.
 THE GOAL 
I am looking to raise $10,000 to cover the costs of publishing, manufacturing, marketing and distributing God Made Me Coily and hitting 300 presales of the first edition of the ""Nia"" Collection Dolls, planning an expansion of doll line next. As long as I can reach this goal, I will be able to launch my book and doll series in a timely manner.

   About Serda Brewing
Serda Brewing is a craft beer microbrewery being constructed in downtown Mobile, Alabama to serve the Greater Mobile and regional Gulf Coast markets. Located at 600 Government Blvd., the over 12,000 square foot facility will incorporate production and packaging facilities as well as a pub-style hospitality venue for tours and retail bar sales of the brewery's products. The beers offered will reflect traditional German beer styles as evolved by modern American craft brewer boldness and innovation.
The core brand beers will be traditional German styles that have had an American craft beer face lift: richer in flavor, bolder in strength, more complex in character, a reflection of the past with modern craft brewing innovation. There is a notable void in the industry craft beer menu as most new breweries have focused on West Coast style micro-brews and a smattering of English style ales. Serda Brewing will bring about more choices of what consumers are looking for in a market crowded with a limited style selection. Our flagship beer will be our Hook, Line & Lager - light straw to golden color and crystal clear. Hops are very prevalent with a spicy bitterness and a spicy floral flavor and aroma. Smooth and crisp with a clean malty palate. Lagers are more difficult to make and take longer, but they're worth the extra effort.  
Our Beers
Hook Line & Lager - Pilsner   Our flagship Pilsner, brilliant and zesty with ample hop bite. Malted rye and noble hops deliver a spicy refreshing zing. A perfect beer for any occasion, especially thirsty occasions.  
Profile notes: Pale golden with thinning white head, black pepper sharp hop aroma with faint toasted grain and sulfur yeast lingering in the back, crisp slight malt sweetness behind noble hop forward balance, bitter hop is perceived as dryness that does not linger in the aftertaste. Very fresh German noble hops and yeast at the forefront, malt sweetness is present but subdued.  Rye malt adds a layer of complexity and a slight oily/creamy texture that helps lighten the hop bite.
Clear Prop - Porter    Our flagship dark beer brewed in the Baltic Porter style.  A heavier but balanced offering to please stout and porter drinkers with a variation of style seldom introduced into American beer markets.  Layers of subtle roast and caramel honey-prune flavors weighed out with a mellow bitter smoky and herbal hops. 
Profile Notes:  Dark unfiltered opaque brown with a off-white frothy head. Heavy leaning with layers of malt complexity.  Some smoked perception lingers in the background from the hops even though this is not a smoked beer.  As forward the malt flavors are, the beer does not finish as thick as you would think, the higher alcohol thins the body out to a more moderate mouth feel.  You can drink several of these, but you will feel the effects.
Mobile Bay - IPA    Brewed with several new German hop varieties and traditional alt-bier yeast using American craft brewing techniques to drop a hop bomb of unique citrus aromas balanced with the smooth malt base of German barley. 
Profile Notes: Upon first look, the beer pours slightly clouded from unfiltered hop oils and has a tight frothy sticky head. IPA nose is very upfront and packs a fresh citrus/mandarin orange/apple-pear punch.   Moderate body from a strong pale ale fermented drier than most American versions. Won't leave you with heavy thick finish, but a lingering sweet hop burn.
Tidewater - Vienna  A smooth malty amber mainstay with clean moderate hop bitterness in balance with toasty sweetness.  Floral and spicy in both malt and hop aroma, but easy drinking and satisfyingly complex. 
Profile Notes:  Pouring a reddish amber with a tight creamy white head, the sparkling carbonation releases refreshing floral and spicy aromas from both the toasted malts and noble hops.  Once settled in in the mug, the carbonation subsides to a smooth and slightly sweet quaff with a hint of caramel and a kiss of herbal hops.  Moderate body with  short lingering flavor makes this brew a perfect companion to any type of meal.

 Our Director of Brewing - Todd Hicks
Twenty plus years of professional craft brewing experience in brewpubs and microbreweries
Director of Brewing Operations, Serda Brewing Company Twenty plus years of professional craft brewing experience in brewpubs and microbreweries
Originally from the greater New Orleans area, Todd moved from Destrehan, LA to Mobile in 1982, starting 6th grade at St. Dominic Catholic School. He then went to McGill-Toolen Catholic High School, graduating in 1988. After high school, Todd attended the University of South Alabama from 1988-1992.
Todd first became interested in the fickle art of fermentation during his teenage years. Ironically, his initial inspiration was his family’s winemaking hobby. After Todd won a Best Specialty Wine award for a potion made from Prickly Pear Cactus fruit, his Mom shut out her main competition by buying her son a “True Brew” beer rig for his 18th birthday. Already having a taste for great imported beers, Todd knew, with practice, that he could brew beer himself. By the time he got to the University of South Alabama, he was experimenting with every type of unique brew he could concoct.
Todd Hicks is a familiar face in the craft beer community's cast of professional brewers and beer advocates. He joined Mobile's Port City Brewery, located on Dauphin St., in 1993 and was instrumental in the opening of Alabama's first brewpub since Prohibition. Todd started as an Assistant Brewer in training under Brewmaster Bradley Fournier and was quickly promoted to Head Brewer. He also brewed occasionally at the company's other location, Magic City Brewery, in Birmingham, AL. Over the years of beers to follow, his devotion to brew the best and most unique craft beers possible has never strayed. This determination (and subsequent reputation) has led to numerous head brewer and consulting positions for Todd all over the southeastern US. Todd’s specialization within the trade is troubleshooting and upgrading equipment, reviewing procedures to increase efficiency, and hands-on training of brewery staff. Not to mention, he is adept at producing a variety of great tasting, unique beer styles!
While still working occasionally for Mobile’s Port City Brewery, Todd moved to the Florida Panhandle and began brewing along the Emerald Coast. He started brewing with Steve Fried at McGuire's Irish Pub in Pensacola and then was key in the 1996 startup of McGuire's of Destin. In 1997, Todd left McGuire's to brew at the Santa Rosa Bay Brewery in Fort Walton Beach, and later that year also took over brewing for Sharktooth Brewery, which later became Nigel Manley's Microbrewery across the island in Destin. After Mobile’s Port City Brewery closed in 2001, Todd began consulting, training new brewers at Hal & Mal’s Brewery in Jackson, MS, and providing brewing services to The Cannon Brewpub in Columbus, GA. He knew, however, that with the closure of Port City, a prime location and a lot of brewing equipment became available back in Mobile.
Starting in early 2002, Todd developed a plan to purchase and reopen the former Port City Brewery under a new banner, Mr. Jim's Cannon Brewpub. The name was in memory of the deceased co-founder of The Cannon Brewpub in Columbus. 2003 was a year of extensive renovation with Todd as Project Manager. “Mobile’s” Cannon Brewpub opened in early 2004 with Todd as Brewery Manager. On the refurbished 15-barrel brewing system, he brewed a few of the original Cannon brands with revised recipes and a few revamped brands from Mobile's beer past.
Unfortunately, the absentee owners from Columbus had legal issues back in Georgia and in early 2006 had to eventually sell their entire operation. Mobile’s location was not exempt, and Mr. Jim’s Cannon Brewpub closed as a result. In mid-2006, Hurricane Brewing purchased the equipment, leased the property, and began plans to open at the same location on Dauphin Street. Todd was hired as Head Brewer and was responsible for developing fresh recipes for the new operators. Hurricane Brewing opened in late 2006 after six months of renovations. Todd’s brewing goal was to keep the focus on the beer itself and increase the number of beer styles available by adding new keg space and upgrading the draft beer system. He created a variety of contemporary English/Irish beer styles that have been widely reproduced in the wake of the craft brewing revolution. Sadly, Hurricane Brewing also only lasted about two years due to a myriad of internal issues. The building owners decided to turn upper stories into offices and lease out the bar area to a Mexican-themed restaurant, which is where Montego’s is located today.
Back in 2003, Todd joined the grass roots movement of “Free the Hops” as a founding member. He volunteered to organize the Mobile Free the Hops Chapter and lead the local beer community in support of shattering the embargo against craft beer in Alabama. This work continues today with his involvement in the Alabama Brewers Guild, where he was also a founding member and briefly a Board of Directors member.
By word of mouth, and through introduction at the WYES International Beer Festival in New Orleans, Todd was approached by two business partners about consulting on a brewery business plan in 2010. After about a year of planning, a site was selected in Baton Rouge, and construction began with a tight budget, a used 30-barrel brewing system, and a few new fermenters. Todd spent a couple of years consulting in various stages of recipe development, construction, training of brewers, and equipment expansions. Their business and facility is growing every year and shows no signs of slowing down. This brewery is known as Tin Roof and continues to be very successful to this day.
Currently, Todd and four investment partners (who are also all McGill-Toolen graduates!) are opening Serda Brewing Company, a 30-barrel brewhouse and packaging microbrewery with a tap room style pub in Mobile, Alabama. The downtown location, at 600 Government Street, is directly adjacent to Lower Dauphin Street and connects directly with the LoDa Entertainment District and the many popular restaurant and bar venues nearby. It is also directly on the Mardi Gras parade route! Serda Brewing will have ample outdoor patio seating (shaded by large sail cloths) and an outdoor food truck court. The tap room will feature one of Mobile’s largest bars, nearly 40 feet in length and crescent shaped that will span the width of the tap room. On site, secure parking will be plentiful. Serda will both keg and bottle its year-round beers for distribution. Seasonal and specialty test beers will be available only in the taproom in the near future. A July 2017 opening is being targeted.

Many of us remain insecure in who we are, but that is something I'm hoping to change with this project. Body painting is often traditionally used to cover up the body, or to ""enhance"" a models appeal. With this project I wanted to take a more artistic approach. I want to show who these people are by painting their identities on their skin and I wanted to do it in a way that made them proud and made them feel beautiful about themselves. There's a celebration of who we are as people and how we are seen in the eyes of others.
Subject Chad
What began as solitary appointments has expanded and has grown to include relationships. So far I've painted friends, strangers, people I worked with, people I acted with, sisters, brothers, couples and best friends... but I'm hoping to expand and be able to capture a much wider range of relationships. 
Subject Georgia
The project has also begun to extend into film as well, such as the music video for ""Petty Victories"" entitled Concrete and Rosy Cheeks.
As someone who has struggled with body issues myself, I've also begun to turn the paint brush on myself to craft images relating to pain, joy and remorse. I feel that by exploring these complicated emotions in a tangible way it has often helped me to sort through overwhelming times.
The project now carries a new mandate. I want to be able to paint more people. More relationships. I'd love to paint every gender, orientation, race and age. We are a diverse people after all and the more I try to diversify the richer this collection will become.
The money I raise from this Kickstarter will be going to three things:
#1 - I am hoping to raise enough money to expand my collection of paints and brushes in an attempt to find something that will be safer to use on the human body without sacrificing the rich and bright colours of the paint.
#2 - I am hoping to craft a 40-60 page hard cover coffee table book that will not only document the creation of the canvases, but will also capture the impressions I had of the experience, both immediate and lasting , as well as  highlights from every persons journal entry to offer a comprehensive account of both of our emotional headspaces.
#3 - I don't want to keep this project a secret and have decided to produce a gallery show which will take place in Toronto later this year. The show would feature roughly 20-30 of my best pictures blown up to a gallery size, would include copies of my book for people to purchase and would also include a live model demonstration of the procedure.
Subject Mark
Ideally I'd love to take this new expressive form of body painting around to schools and universities to teach the techniques I'm discovering to other artists.  I would love to see this project grow into something bigger and better and hope that you will help me to achieve that. 
I would love to have your help with this endeavor! Please feel free to contact me with any potential questions you have on the process, the project or to be a canvas. Don't hesitate to contact me!

939,611473636,"In the follow up to his best-selling book, The Retrospections of Sherlock Holmes, Thaddeus Tuffentsamer once again delves into the battered tin dispatch box to retrieve more delightful canonical adventures in Further Reminiscences of Sherlock Holmes.
Four new Holmes’ adventures including the novella, the Giant Rat of Sumatra. Plus another fan favorite, Joseph Bell adventure.
The Adventure of the Tiger’s blood
Holmes’ new client, Mr. Blanchard has just inherited his late uncle’s manor. As he is settling in, he is becoming more and more unsettled. His staff is quiet, too quiet when it comes to his uncle’s death. The only comment made in regard to it is the fact that the tiger cub should not have died. Seeing that something is amiss, he retains Holmes to find out what the real issues are.
The Adventure from the chair
Holmes receives a request from Mr. Nelson who is in turmoil. He has received a strange visitor from ‘the future’ who tells him that he must act quickly or the life of someone he loves will be lost. Not knowing what to believe, he asks Holmes for help. (This story is penned by Holmes himself as Watson was gone for the day, and Holmes solves it, ‘from the chair’)
The Adventure of the African Crown Jewel
The African government learns that their long lost Crown Jewel is set to go on display at the museum. Mycroft, failing to diplomatically retrieve it from the museum, hires Holmes to gather a crew and steal it, (in order to serve the Queen and save diplomatic ties, of course.)
The Adventure of the Giant Rat of Sumatra
Set six weeks after Watson meets Holmes and begins sharing rooms with him, a threat hits London. A plague that is only striking a certain demographic. A demographic that has the financial means to support a growing criminal organization. A giant rat is set loose to attack them and make demands. But what does the giant rat of Sumatra have to do with Holmes, Watson, Moriarty, and the Island of Dr. Moreau? It is an adventure that the world is finally ready to hear. (This story is a novella, taking up more than a third of the overall book.)
The Adventures of Joseph Bell: The critical art critic
Sherrington Hope, private consulting detective and his loyal chronicler, Ormond Secker have become the new consulting duo in London, but when a curator is murdered and they begin to bumble their way through the process, Inspector LaRue asks Bell and Doyle to once again assist Scotland Yard in finding out who the killer is.
The author is also an artist, whose works have been in museum displays. He has included twelve new illustrations throughout the book, incorporating them into each of the stories, in the spirit of the original The Strand illustrated adventures. 
Due to Covid-19 delivery times will be impacted.  The company doing the printing of the book has been impacted and rather than 1 week to print and ship to me, it is now taking about 5 weeks.  That is why I pushed out the delivery to December of this year.
To offer my readers a thank you for your patience with this, each physical copy, paperback, and hardcover will be signed.  There is no special reward for a signed copy with this campaign.   
New Stretch goal added 8-22-2020.  We were fully funded in 2 days.  We are currently at $600.00.  If we double that, we will include a hand made bookmark with each physical copy of the book, and a PDF copy with the electronic version of the book.

(almost) good enough to eat!
 This is about climate change. Coal power has never been ""clean"" and continuing to mine and burn it causes irreparable harm to frontline communities and accelerates climate change. The current administration wants to prop up this outmoded industry without regard to the known consequences. As we have seen, nostalgia is a powerful tool––it can make what is familiar seem wholesome and innocuous, as ""American as apple pie."" But like the sweet treats we might find in an old-fashioned bakery, a little dirty energy might look like a harmless enough indulgence, but our global consumption patterns will be our undoing. Put simply, we can't have our cake and eat it too.
I need your help to build a mobile bakery counter that I can take out onto the streets. If funded, it will make its debut appearance during the annual Gowanus Open Studios weekend. Gowanus, home of a federal Superfund site, is itself a cautionary tale about environmental degradation and about the last place you'd expect to find a pop-up bakery. But that weekend people from all over the city descend on the neighborhood to see what's happening there and visit artists' studios.
Cart drawing
It is my goal to use the bakery as a conversation starter, and help each person I meet identify an action that they can take to help transition away from dirty energy. The bakery will be fully stocked with faux ""desserts"" for sale, and I'll be splitting the proceeds from sales that weekend with the Citizens' Climate Lobby.
I believe art can change people's perceptions and encourage them to think differently about the future and their role in creating it. With your help I can bring Coal Comforts into being, in Gowanus and beyond.
 The rewards:
  Coal Cookie
   Mini Cheesecake
  Coal Cupcake
  Art Tart
  Bundt Cake (plus bonus dessert!)
  Birthday Cake (plus 3 bonus desserts and tour!)

941,539291526,"During the last twelve months I have spent my free time working on a new group of fine art acrylic paintings. These will be exhibited from mid-March through mid-April in the 2011 Alumni Invitational Exhibition at Mississippi University for Women. MUW has $300 available to help defray expenses. I need additional funding to cover framing for the acrylic paintings and to assist with shipping costs.
FUNDING WILL GO TOWARDS:
Framing for the ten new acrylic paintings on canvas and funds toward crating and shipping the pieces round trip from San Francisco, CA to Columbus, MS.
Any funding beyond this will go toward expenses related to photographing and documenting the paintings.
SYNOPSIS AND PROCESS:
These paintings are an exciting new direction for me, an outcome of my breast cancer diagnosis in 2009, when I looked for a way to turn the experience into something positive. At that time I asked the question, ""If my cancer could talk, what would it tell me?"" The answer was that I needed to find time for painting, and my Praesentia Series was born.
These recent paintings are representations of structures that symbolize passages: turning points in life when a person is forced to look within when facing a difficult challenge. I use value and contrast to draw the viewer from the darkness and toward the light. The light represents hope and renewal. For subject matter, I've used photos I've taken of the watchtowers at the Great Wall in China as well as passageways at Fort McHenry in Baltimore and Fort Point in San Francisco.
The word ""praesentia"" means ""presence"" in Latin. To me it represents one of the ways I got through the cancer experience: by practicing ""being in the moment"" rather than focusing on the past or the future. This said, my paintings are not about cancer but about the human experience. They are like snapshots in time. 
The exhibition at MUW feels pivotal as it will be the first public exhibit of this series. After this show I hope to exhibit the Praesentia pieces on the West Coast, regularly adding new paintings to the group. I would really, REALLY appreciate your help in getting these paintings displayed! 
About Mississippi University for Women: Founded in 1884 as the first public college for women in the United States, MUW is a tradition-rich university that has also educated men for more than 20 years. U.S.News & World Report has consistently ranked MUW among the top Southern public master's universities.

By building this extension, we would like to bring players the ultimate fantasy and bring to life an unforgettable adventure that revolves around The Dragon Code game. We’ll build amazing new features!
The story
“The origins
The Dragon Code, the magic and power of dragons concentrated in one code, was created by the first dragon to maintain the balance of the world. After he created the code, the Dragon King carved it on a sacred tablet to keep it safe from the corrosion of time. The world evolved and humans evolved together with the dragons. However, in time, quarrels raged out. Some were overtaken by their ambition to rule the world. They struggled for power and greed took over the hearts of many. These were dark ages. The dragons held the power to the balance or destruction of the world. The humans had no choice but to side with the dragons and live together. Ambitions unfolded Humans, a frail, yet cunning race, have always lived under the domination of dragons. The fearful and gigantic winged demons held the power of life and death. They held the key to the gateway to either balance or chaos. However, humans were not to be taken lightly. Equipped with a swift mind and many talents, they were a race that even the almighty dragons were wary of. And among the humans, there would be a diversity in characters, just like the dragons'. While the strong tried to maintain peace and protect values like honor and compassion, there were many who would do anything for power and possessions. Ambition took over the hearts of the weak. Those who had the most influence attracted others, finally leaving two leading powers inside the world of dragons: Shiro – the white dragon clan and Kuro - the black dragon clan.
 And so the world got stained in two colors: the white and the black, the yin and the yang, the tranquil and the furious. The dragons split into two clans, fighting for world domination. The white clan to protect the world and keep its sanctity, the dark clan to fulfill its ambition of gaining power and rule of the world. Caught in the middle of the dragons' raffle, humans started joining sides with the faction that supported their beliefs the most. Those who wanted to become the knights of justice and sanctity, the masters of balance and meditation joined the Shiro clan which took a protective stance. Those taken over by lust and thirst for power, joined the Kuro clan taking an assertive approach towards total domination. Growing up where they could, treated roughly by the conditions of the land, men and women alike learned different fighting styles. From vagabonds to martial artists, each of them was forced to build survival skills.
The fall of bones and wings
 The future was yet to unfold. Due to the opposite forces growing in power, the sacred tablet was broken into pieces and the dragon code lost. The world emerged into chaos and, as it was slowly crumbling away. The peace had to be first restored to the world, either that or domination. By the word of the Dragon King, there had to be only one force taking over the world or the balance of yin and yang had to be preserved. Due to the dragons' fury and refusal for cooperation, there was no hope for a yin/yang balance. And so the battles for world domination started. Across the world, sacred locations were appointed for dragon battles. And so the fall of bones and wings started. As they fought, many got turned to dust and many tried to hide. But there was no place to hide. As the world went into collapse, they all had to join in the battle of the ages. Now it is your turn to make a difference, stranger. The earth is crumbling away with screams of terror in the air. The fields are burning and sounds of metal clashing on metal echo in the distance. It is the time. The battle calls. Which path will you walk on? Which side will you join your destiny with? Which clan will succeed? Which clan will come to dominate the new world? Who will be king in the new world?”
Characters  
The Dragon Code: Fantasy will turn the classic game into a role-play experience, with 4 different characters, skills that can overturn the state of the game, achievements to collect and items to boost your gameplay.
“Mankind had no choice but to survive in the dark times of the dragons. As their villages perished, one by one, most fled and some perished into the wilderness. However, there were some who used any means necessary to survive the rough conditions of the land.”  
 Gameplay
1. Characters  
Characters will only be available with the launching of The Dragon Code: Fantasy. In the beginning of the game, the player will be asked to choose one of the 4 characters, input a username and pledge allegiance to a dragon faction.
 The player will be able to create up to 4 characters/ account, with the option of removing them.
 2. Game factions
 In The Dragon Code: Fantasy, the player will be asked to pledge their allegiance to one of the ruling powers in the game: the Shiro clan, which is the white dragon clan or the Kuro clan - the black dragon clan. These correspond to two opposite forces, represented by the color of the white and black pieces. In the classic game, these roles are shifted randomly according to the order in which players join a game. In the Fantasy extension, once a character is created and the player chooses a side, they will be a member of that faction permanently for that character.
 The Dragon Code board is composed of 10 x 7 spaces, on which the pieces of the players can move vertically, horizontally and diagonally. The game starts with 5 pieces of each color belonging to the 2 players. Once a piece is conquered, the piece shifts color and the number of pieces in the player’s dragon increases, while the opponent’s decreases.
4. Elemental bonuses
 According to the chosen faction, the player will obtain some elemental attributes that will later affect the course of the game, precisely, the effect and duration of the special skills.
5. Skills and energy  
There are five different special skills, one for each element:
 Blazing wind (fire) - Scorch: burn one of the opponent's pieces
 Moving sand (earth) - Stun: disables one of the opponent's pieces for one round; the opponent cannot move that piece
 Dancing river (water) - Double move: provides an extra move
 Iron blossom (metal) - Immortality: makes one piece immortalized in one round; the piece can be jumped over, but not conquered; it does not become part of the opposite dragon's body.
 Nature spirit (Wood) - Regeneration: revives a burned piece
 Using special move requires energy. This energy can either be collected on the field or purchased before the game starts. Unless there has been purchased energy before the game starts, then players start with 0 energy. Acquisition of the energy will be happen gradually, per turn. Each special move can only be used once during a match.
6. Boosters
Energy items: The player will have the option to buy energy containers which will replenish their Energy sphere. They will come in different sizes and will be available from the Item Mall

949,425030063,"Hello everybody! My name is Ian, aka Cometkins Art, and I'm an independent illustrator based out of Colorado. I was blown away by the amazing response to the first print run of these decks of cards, and I knew I had to come back to Kickstarter to get your support again!
I've grown to love Dungeons and Dragons since I started playing my home campaign over four years ago, and the Deck of Many Things has become the most tantalizing item, thus the idea sparked to make my own. I endeavored to create a version that appealed to my aesthetic needs, and hopefully to others! It was two years in the making, and it's finally here.
100% of my Artist Alley merchandise before the first print Kickstarter was self-funded. However, when it came time to do the math for these decks of cards, it became clear that I wouldn't ever be able to print and sell these at a reasonable price without help from crowdfunding. Once again that is the case here, and I have returned to ask for your assistance in bringing in a new stock of these amazing cards.
I first began creating the deck by making the Moon card, and it set the tone for how the rest of the Deck would end up. The final card I did was Throne; I saved it for last because I knew I'd need to learn more about how I wanted to paint these before I could get it to look how I imagined, and I'm very satisfied. I challenged myself a lot with the art in the deck, made many revisions and tweaks, and it finally came together.
Each card has been illustrated to demonstrate both the name of the card as well as hint at the effect it has as best as possible. You'll notice the Moon card has three stars for up to three wishes, or that the Jester card represents the wealth of EXP you gain through gold coins. Each of the 22 cards is vibrant and colorful and is sure to impress your players when they pull from the deck! This time around, you'll also notice some small improvements to the graphic design, such as better text wrapping on the banners with the card titles.
The base funding covers the print of all 22 cards, the custom art tuck box (slightly improved from its previous design), as well as the brand new card back with silver holographic constellations! This is something I had wanted for the original Deck, but was previously unable to find a printer able to do so. Now you get the Deck in all its intended glory! The gold edging will be gone in favor of something a little more noticeably flashy and mysterious.
Also included from the start in the base funding will be the guide booklet! It was a free upgrade in a stretch goal in our previous campaign, but it's just too valuable to not include right away this time! Never pull out your clunky DMG again!
There are options to order two and three decks as bundles if you and your friends would like to save on shipping for international orders, and there are 24-deck bundles for friendly local game stores that would like to carry the Deck on their shelves!
Top Row: Talons, Throne, Knight, Idiot, Flames. Bottom Row: Moon, The Fates, Fool, Euryale.
Top Row: Star, Donjon, Gem, Key, Skull, Fool. Bottom Row: Ruin, Rogue, Comet, The Void, Balance, Sun, Vizier.
Front side of guide booklet.
Back half of guide booklet.
Featuring the constellations of Pegasus, Draco, Scorpius, and Cygnus in silver holographic foil.
Improved card box design as well!
As all of the artwork for the deck and add-ons is complete at this time, it should mean that this will be a fairly quick campaign! Crowdfunding will go on for 30 days, and then once funds reach me I'll be able to order everything in swift fashion. I estimate roughly a month of time to order and print all the rewards, and then a month or so to organize and ship everything out to you all; this should hopefully account for minor delays because of weather, surprise holidays, quarantine related postal delays, as well as any necessary social isolation that's required at this time. I would like to have all decks and rewards out to everybody by October, November at the latest, but everybody will be notified ASAP should that change.
I have set the base goal at $3500. This will account for the decks and their included booklets, as well as shipping costs and add-on rewards for backers.
Below is a chart showing the rough breakdown of all the costs; the majority of the money is for the decks and add-on rewards, with the second biggest portion being for shipping costs (the curse of us all), and then finally Kickstarter and bank fees.
While the main product I'm offering is of course the Deck of Many Things, it never hurts to have some fun extras! There's not many so that shipping times don't get bogged down too much with waiting for products to arrive, but requests for more will be taken into account!

Want a cool extra that won't break the bank? Then these buttons are for you! A set of 3 1.5 inch buttons with a cool holographic star finish! The artwork you see here is what will be present on the final buttons, based on their popularity in the previous campaign.
Drawstring Bag (+$10)
5.5in x 6.5in/13.5cm x 16.5cm. Deck fits perfectly inside. Holds up to 15 standard 7pc polyhedral dice sets.
One of the most popular rewards from last campaign is our matching drawstring bag, and it's back again! It's said in the DM's Guide that the Deck of Many Things is found in a drawstring bag, and it felt appropriate to include for those that want it. Store your cards inside for added mystery, or use as a traditional dice bag for all your dice goblin needs.
While our base funding definitely covers for a lot, there's always room for some other fun upgrades and add-ons! All of our stretch goals are laid out here, and include free backer rewards and deck upgrades. 
Unlocked!
This was one of the MOST requested stretch goals of the previous campaign, but I felt that the previous company I worked with just couldn't give me the results I wanted and that my backers deserved. The new company I'm working with is able to give the amazing, shiny foiling that I desire, and of course it has to be the first upgrade! At $4000 raised, ALL backer decks will be upgraded to have gold foiling on their deckbox! It will be that extra bit of shine that helps it stand out.
Digital mockup featuring new box artwork and foil simulation.
Unlocked!
In our previous campaign, backers got rewarded with free stickers for their awesome efforts, and that will remain true in this campaign! At $5000 raised, all backers will receive three holographic stickers! These designs will be voted on by all of you at the end of the campaign, so start thinking of your favorite artwork now!
Designs not final; to be voted on by backers.
 Unlocked! 
Left to right: Skull, The Fates, Moon.
At $5500 raised, an acrylic keychain add-on reward will be unlocked for all backers! They will come in three designs featuring some of the most popular artwork from the previous campaign, and you'll have a choice to back from just the one, or for a set of all three! They will cost $10 for a single keychain, and $25 for the set of three. They'll feature a sturdy gold-colored keyring and flashy gold edging, harkening back to the long lost gold edges of the last print run!
Unlocked!
At $6500 raised, all backers will receive a set of three free bookmarks! In the previous campaign, bookmarks were a surprise bonus for everybody, but this time you'll be getting a set of three, with artwork voted on by you! Perfect for keeping track of your most used spots in your books.
Bookmark bonus from previous campaign; final designs to be voted on by backers.
Unlocked!
We've heard you, so now it's an option! At $10000 raised, all backer decks will have their cardstock upgraded to premium black core! Pretty much all TCGs on the market use 280 GSM blue core cardstock and what the deck uses by default, which is a very fine, long lasting print stock that stands up to shuffling and use over time, but we can go further! Casino grade playing cards will often use 330 GSM black core cardstock, which allows them to take to more shuffling for longer, and makes them much more durable in general. It's a very expensive, high quality material, and if we can reach this goal, it will mean that much more longevity for your cards, even if you never sleeve them up! It's a rather lofty goal, but will add that extra premium feel, so let's go!
 Unlocked!
Something that backers absolutely loved about the last campaign was the gold gilt edges on their cards for that extra bit of shine and mystery. Well, turns out my new printer is able to do that very thing after all! At $15000 raised, all backer decks will be upgraded to have gold gilt edges! This was something I was originally sad to lose, but now nobody has to fret, they'll be back!"

25 years of experience working with erotic models.
Amazing stories from the life of an Art Nude photo artist.
Lovely Girls - Nude Models
- Who are they on set and behind the scenes?
Let's answer right away - they are very sexy and they are different!
Also completely mystical cases happens!
And they are worth to hear and see!
Hello!) I am Kate.
Me and group of my friends want to create a documentary about the work of the mystic photographer Alexandr Furdui.
It won't be just a documentary.
It will be a mystical interview with the Author and Characters of his Adult Fantasy Book!

We decided to create this film for the double anniversary:
- 55 years of life and 25 years of photographer and decorator Alexandr Furdui.
Alexandr writes and illustrates a Fantasy Book.
This is a mystical Dystopia about the terrible future of Mankind.
Terrible, but very beautiful!
After all, the main heroines of the book are beautiful warlike girls - the Amazons.

The presentation of the mystical book was the only and first time Alexandr spoke in front of a video camera.
Just for a few minutes ...
In this film, we will do a long interview for the first time.
The author will tell in details about his Fantasy Dystopia.
And YES - you will be able to ask your questions too!
Alexandr Furdui - Photo artist and decorator, working in the Art Nude Fantasy style.
A documentary movie about the photographer and his mystical work.
+ PDF album of the best works with mystical predictions.
We are preparing this film in the mystical documentary interview style with a photographer and his beautiful models.
A documentary film about the photographer and his mystical work.
 + PDF with the best portfolio of the photographer with mystical predictions.
It is gonna be a film with a mystical documentary interview of Alexandr and his beautiful models.
Some of you are already saw these amazing calendars.
Below you see lovely model who posed for this calendar.
The calendar girl tries a new image of the blonde.
It's not usual for her, but she really likes it!
This will be a unique interview!

The author will talk about his work for the first time!
You will be the first to hear the story of the photographer.
And you can ask your questions to Alexandr!
Yes, you can get into this movie too!
Interesting? We just started:)
___________________________________________
Alexandr works a lot and doesn't tell anything about himself.
Some interesting facts about Alexandr Furdui

 Just see what he knows and can do:
- Love for the visual arts was born in early childhood - Alexandr grew up in the art workshop of his father.
- The author makes costumes, accessories and decorations for photo shoots himself. Also he illustrates his book on his own.
- Alexandr writes a Mystical Adult Tale in verse and prose.
- Higher medical education allows Alexandr combine scientific knowledge and mysticism.
Yes, the path of Alexandr’s life is full of mysticism. He is given visions of his personal fate and the fate of humanity. With terrifying accuracy - personal visions and prophetic dreams comes true!
At 55 years old, Alexandr can already look back and know exactly what prophecies have already become a reality!
In this film we will combine the real biography of a photo artist and fiction from his photographs.
Yes! We will ORGANIZE A MEETING OF THE AUTHOR WITH HIS FANTASY WORLD CHARACTERS!
First, Alexandr will tell you the story of his life full of mystical events.
He will talk about his difficult creative path. After all, he was faced with a choice - to give up a successful career in the medical business for the sake of his beloved creativity ...

Instead of a career, Alexandr took the difficult path of a creative person.
And his path is really very thorny.
Let's just say that due to several crises there were lots of job losses.
The magazine Penthouse (Kyiv - Ukraine) – where photographer is used to work, was closed.
The first large studio in which Alexander worked was closed also.
Then, because of the war in Ukraine, the second large studio was destroyed ...
But the author didn’t give up!
Each time Alexandr started anew - he created new decorations and continued to work! To follow his dream!
Look at the freshest decorations for 2020 - here we will shoot an interview with the photographer.
As was said before, the first part of the interview will be the biography of the Author of Photo Pictures.
______
Then we will plunge into the Fantasy  World ... We assure you - it will be very interesting!
This film will be full of documentary mystical interview with a photo artist and his beautiful models.
So get ready - the film will be full of unique philosophical discourses of Life and Death.
Without complexes and taboos, we will talk about the most exciting issues - how this world works and why do we live here!?
This film, despite the complex subject matter, will not be boring!
After all, beautiful warrior girls will interfere the dialogues!
You will meet real Amazons!
You know, people talks that Creative People, Artists and Poets, predict the future ...
Let's see what Fantastic version of the Future is predicted by the Alexandr Furdui work...
Alexandr creates a new philosophy based on the synthesis of modern scientific knowledge and ancient magic.
To not this worldview be boring - the characters of Fantasy Tale itself will tell you about it.
Yes, Alexandr creates his own Fantasy Universe.
In this Universe is no place for Lies, Hypocrisy and stupid Complexes generated by pseudo-morality.
The main values in the new world are Beauty and Sincerity, Honesty and readiness for self-sacrifice.
The beauty of nature and the naked female body adorn the New World. Don’t you want to admire this beauty forever!?
The combination of Beauty and Honesty makes this World harmonious.
Honesty to others and to your inner ""I"" - will not give a chance to Lies and Hypocrisy take over the new world.

953,764863414,"Mori is the vision of local Adelaide illustrator and visual artist Jess Lewis. 
This is brand is her love child, born from her deep passion for her specialised illustration practice and creative drive. 
This Kickstarter campaign has been organized to get the Mori brand's first shirt design off the ground, if it is successful it will allow more designs to be produced for Etsy and market stores.

Stretch Goal 1 - $1000, 20 x Rad Skull Shirts
Rad Skull
 20 pledges will allow for the minimum orders of the Rad Skull Shirt to be produced and the profits will allow for an extra design to be released. The more pledges over 20, the brighter the future of Mori as a sole trading business will look. The profits from Rad Skull orders will go towards more designs to be released and sold, and any marketing that needs to be produced and printed.

Stretch Goal 2 - $2,150, 43 x Rad Skull Shirts 
Hopeless Case
43 Rad Skull Shirts sold will allow me to add another design to this Kickstarter. The shirt design is called Hopeless Case and features another illustration from this series. This option will be added once the required amount of Rad Skull shirts have been sold. 

Stretch Goal 3 - Duzza For Your Bruzza design 
Details will be added once the above stretch goal is met. 
Mori aims to support illustrators and visual artists that fall under the same aesthetic and philosophies. This brand has the opportunity to grow into something supportive.

All products that are of produced by Mori are of high quality and made using local businesses.  
Shirts screen printed by hand at RTD - http://www.rtdscreenprinting.com/

954,626306998,"This project is about a dream. One that began over fifteen years ago, and it is still ongoing. Life has taken us on many tangents in those fifteen years, and in all honesty, getting this project off the ground was a long shot all along. No self respecting funding source would consider financing this. But with the advent of social investing we see a great opportunity to find out if what we have envisioned can if fact be made real. Up until now we have invested almost $1.5 million in the initial, exploratory phase of this project. Our initial desk-top plasma device produced some very early but encouraging results. We are now looking to expand this work to its next phase. 
Our goal, in short, is to re-imagine the way we access space with this: 
Prototype inside and out
We are seeking to create new technology, one that is sure to be the subject of much controversy. A new direction that is not based on our currently accepted and widely used space delivery systems we call rocketry.
 
We are seeking to take a quantum leap forward, a giant leap for mankind if you will, by daring to think way outside the proverbial box. Our goal in nothing less than to develop a space access system based on the control of a universally available reactant - gravity. 
Upper faceplate covering science bay
Gravity control would mean access to space on an unprecedented scale at a tiny fraction of today's cost. With gravity control the stuff of science fiction would become reality. If this technology is possible, development will take time. Upon success a whole new paradigm would open in our space faring endeavor. We would truly open a new frontier, one that holds many secrets, rewards and adventure. 
With the control of gravity we could access space on a scale comparable to air travel today. Flights could depart hourly, bringing about whole new industries like space mining, space tourism, and planetary exploration.

""This can't be done"" is what we usually hear. We are of the mind set that anything is possible when people put their mind to it. Twenty years ago who would have imagined that Apple would revolutionize the world with the iPhone and iPad, Or that we would have TV screens so thin they can be bent. Or that private enterprise would have more rockets available to access space than NASA itself does. 
Can gravity be controlled for flight? 
No one knows. But we sure want to find out. The potential benefits are immense. Some people ask ""Why?"" others ask ""Why not?"". We belong in the latter group. So we are asking ""Why not?"" Why not work on this, there is nothing to lose, and much to gain. 
In the initial phase of the project we are looking to demonstrate, under laboratory constitutions, that gravity can be interacted with (other than an apple falling on our heads), controlled, artificially created. Once we have successfully establish this, the next step will be to build a technology demonstrator prototype, as illustrated here. Please keep in mind that all images displayed are for illustration purposes only and are only engineering drawings. The shape of the craft is a direct result of technological needs, namely spin-symmetric structures. Any resemblance to real or imagined phenomena is just a coincidence. 
This is a cross section of our proposed craft. 

In the center of it is the propulsion system, a toroid shaped plasma chamber, the envisioned engine of change. A plasma based device capable of generating a field that can interact with gravity. We won't post lengthy and elaborate theoretical text on how this system may function. If we can build a working prototype the science of it will be debated in endless papers and meetings, both in support and in contradiction. For this Kickstarter project we are interested in conveying the dream, not the science. The dream of ""What if?"" this can in  fact be built.

The possibility that our vision can be engineered and in the not to distant future people can be visiting space on a daily basis. Lots of people. For a lot of time.

Our proposed flight demonstrator craft is composed of three sections:

- the upper payload bay
- the main body 
 - and the lower payload bay. 
The upper payload bay will house mission specific scientific instruments. There are 4 functional sections, each capable of holding one specific instrument cluster. These can range from equipment to collect data on initial flights, to better understand flight dynamics, to telescopes and interstellar matter collection bays for later missions. It is really up to our imagination to come up with an infinite combination of devices to carry. 
These are a few illustrations of such devices.
Telescope and Spectrometer
Payload bay with energy storage ring
Three scientific palettes from upper payload bay

The main body houses the propulsion system, power generation and storage system. flight control hardware, communications system, and the landing legs, among other support systems. 
Upper faceplate
All electrical components, including main propulsion, are powered by the plasma based power generation unit.
Power generation
The lower payload bay is designed to house an autonomous rover for unmanned exploration. But this lower bay can also be configured for scientific cargo, same as the upper payload bay. 
Power storage units
We can also envision it carrying cargo to be deliver to the space station or anywhere on Earth, when timely delivery is of the essence. Again, the potential uses of this craft are unlimited. In fact we would welcome suggestions posted in the comments section. 
Landing leg
This project is a ""What if"" scenario study therefore the social engineering available to us should be explored. We have also have completed some preliminary illustrations of our planned autonomous folding rover: 
Rover
We can't stress it enough, that this project is, at best, speculative. We do believe the only way it can cross the first hurdle, disbelief, is if it is implemented. Implementation costs money. The sheer benefit of the technology begs for investigation, but in reality, it is near impossible to get it funded. Unless we as people at large, decide to dream a little and crowd fund it. We believe this technology can be successfully engineered. Our participation rewards give people who support us a limited number of tangible items they can enjoy, especially if development is successful. We would ask everyone who contributes to allow their names to be posted on our website (to be launched after funding is successful.) The names of those who help make this happen should be known. 
Support hardware
Upon successful funding we propose to commence activities in two steps: 
- build a laboratory scale test version of the propulsion system to demonstrate gravity interaction, control
- build the prototype illustrated throughout to conduct actual test flights 
The first phase we would like to complete by the end of 2016. The second phase by the end of 2017. 
There are still many questions to be resolved, like how to control the flight's trajectory without any aerodynamic surfaces or jets, how to power the craft while in flight, and how to navigate from point A to point B. But before we can answer these questions, first we need to learn if the most important element of the system. the propulsion matrix capable of interacting with gravity, can in fact be built. 
This is the focus of this Kickstarter fund raising. 
Main body equipment racks
So why don't you all come along as we imagine a future where space access will be as common place as in the best science fiction novels of today.

955,2136575894,"I'm so proud to introduce my third full length Sherlock Holmes novel: The Adventure of the Beer Barons. Here's what's in store...
The Adventure of the Beer Barons
When a beer barrel containing the body of a man is delivered to the door of 221b Baker Street, an intoxicating new adventure begins for Sherlock Holmes. Together with his faithful companion, Dr John Watson, Holmes travels north to Burton-upon-Trent to investigate the poisoning of a regiment in India from a contaminated batch of pale ale.
The incident threatens the reputation of the mighty brewer, Houghton's, which supplies beer to half the world. But Holmes is not the only detective working the case. Miss Gertie Cresswell, owner of a first-class mind and a yellow umbrella, has a few ideas of her own. With militant suffragettes, folding bicycles, and the footprints of what appears to be a three-legged man, the unlikely trio face their most fiendish mystery yet. The game is on!
Sherlock Holmes and The Beer Barons is the latest Sherlock Holmes novel from Chris James. Chris's first novel, Sherlock Holmes and The Ruby Elephants was a huge hit with fans and went on to be translated and released in Italian. His second novel Sherlock Holmes and The Jeweller of Florence was an even bigger hit. Alongside his novels, Chris has contributed stories and poems to a host of anthologies - including the MX Book of New Sherlock Holmes Stories.
Rewards
We have paperbacks, PDFs, signed paperbacks and an exclusive, unseen Sherlock Holmes novella I've written, called The Adventure of the Mechanical Elephant. There are also some Early Bird rewards with limited numbers so you'll need to be quick to grab those.
We've also added a stretch target - when we are past 70 backers, my publisher will plant ten extra trees at Happy Life Children's Home in Kenya as part of their #bookstotrees campaign - here's a short video from the founders of Happy Life on the Books To Trees Project.

Read what Maxim Magazine says about The Cubed Travel Jacket™
   Clothing Arts Featured in:
The Cubed Travel Jacket™ is a 4-season jacket combining distinctive style, innovative pocketing and an eVent® DVStorm™ membrane, the most technically advanced waterproof/breathable fabric in existence.
The Cubed Travel Jacket™ is the one jacket you will never want to leave home without. It's the culmination of years of development and offers more pockets and features than any other waterproof shell available on the market today.
  Reinventing the Waterproof Shell: It Begins with Pockets
A great waterproof shell is your best friend on the road, whether you’re in the city or the mountains. If you've traveled in one, you know what we're talking about.
However, waterproof shells were born in the outdoor industry, which means they’ve been traditionally designed for extreme weather protection during specific outdoor activities like mountaineering. So shells are made with the pockets placed to stay out of the way of a harness and shoulders wide enough for swinging ice axes. This is great if you’re dangling hundreds of feet above a glacier, but impractical for daily life.
So we chose the most practical and beautiful pockets in the jacket world: Twin Napoleons. But with a twist...
Our twin Napoleon INT/EXT PKTS™ (Interior/Exterior accessible pockets) allow you to access essential items without undoing the main zipper. Something we wished we had when attempting to retrieve a wallet or phone from our jackets during rainstorms…
Twin Napoleon INT/EXT PKTS™
We designed the pocketing on the Cubed Travel Jacket™ to accommodate everyday life, while retaining the advancements of technical waterproof materials. With 8 pockets total, you’ll have all the carryability you need to go anywhere.
The laterally zipping lower-right pocket accommodates the removable hood.
Cutting-Edge Waterproof/Breathable Jacket Tech… For Everyday Life
We independently tested every leading Waterproof/Breathable membrane on the market today and concluded the eVent® DVStorm™ membrane lead with perfect waterproofness and awe-inspiring breathability. 
Waterproof/Breathable technology has come a long way since your 90s windbreaker. Our fabric withstood a 20000 mm/24HR water-column test (water accelerated to twice the velocity of a hurricane), while being air permeable (so you don't sweat buckets while climbing a flight of steps), with an incredible 20000 G/M2/24HR breathability rating.
Far less toxic than most DWRs (Durable Water Repellants), and used by environmentally minded companies like Patagonia, the short-chain C6 DWR is our repellant of choice, protecting you and the environment.
Water does not get in, sweat-vapor gets out: advanced science keeping you dry and comfortable.
The jacket is fully taped-seamed, which means every exterior stitch is backed by a line of waterproof tape to form a total seal.
Tape seaming is a highly technical process only a few garment manufacturers in the world, and their highly skilled craftspeople, are capable of producing.
We have years of experience designing articulated patterns to facilitate complete freedom of movement, without the bulk you'll find in other technical shells. Go ahead and stretch, it feels great.
Minimalist Design
Styled as an urban travel jacket, you can go anywhere with it and feel right at home. We chose a highly durable face fabric with a natural feel, which isn’t shiny or noisy like the plastic-feeling face fabrics found on most waterproof shells.
You won’t find a single stitch down the front of the jacket (besides those securing the Napoleon Pockets), a feat achieved by an innovative manufacturing technique where the internal pockets are sewn directly into the taped seams.
We designed the collar so it’s not too high or low, but just right, with ample room to accommodate a scarf.
The perfect height for a jacket's collar.
We've worn a lot of jackets over the years. Some we've loved, others not so much. The Cubed Travel Jacket™ is the culmination of our experiences pushing the boundaries of what a waterproof shell can do for your everyday life. 
Subtle accents and a discreet logo make the jacket appropriate and distinguished whether you're enjoying a bourbon or Spring skiing.
  We relate, because we've wanted The Cubed Travel Jacket™ for years! Choose a reward from above, and as soon as the campaign ends we'll send out a survey asking for your choice in size and color and take it from there. For your support, we're offering the jacket on Kickstarter discounted over 25% off retail.
The Cubed Travel Jacket™ comes in three colors.
Black...
 Slate...
 And Mountain Blue...
Thanks for spending a moment with our jacket. It will change the way you think about going outside. Please share this page with your friends and anyone who appreciates the finer things in life. 
For the Love of Details
Send us into the world!
Guarantee & Exchanges
We guarantee the lifetime of The Cubed Travel Jacket™ from all defects in construction and materials. 
If your jacket does not fit, send it in, and after we've finished fulfilling the rest of the rewards we'll exchange it for you.  
The future of jackets is here."

This system thus makes it possible to answer both the interests of the purchasers and mine, by creating a stimulating and favorable artistic and economic context. The approach is also, in a way, an experience reflecting the current system of artistic speculation. And everyone could benefit directly.
Finally, why kisckstarter? I use this crowdfunding platform, allowing me to bypass the traditional hermetic spaces

La création de ces 100 tableaux sur le même thème est un véritable périple artistique, le concept de ce projet a pour but dans le meilleur des cas de m'ouvrir une porte dans le monde de l'art. 
Chaque tableau est vendu la somme de 1000 francs.  Dans un espoir utopique de pouvoir admirer ma cote d'artiste ainsi que la valeur que prend en même temps chacune des toiles. Ce système permet donc de répondre tant aux intérêts des acquéreurs que du mien, en créant un contexte artistique et économique stimulant et favorable. La démarche est également, en quelque sorte, une expérience reflétant le système actuel de la spéculation artistique. Et tous pourraient en bénéficier directement.

Enfin, pourquoi kisckstarter ? J'utilise cette plateforme de crowdfunding, me permettant de contourner les espaces traditionnels hermétiques.

960,1638399244,"OOp is born with the objective that any person, company or trade can start a business without assuming greater economic risks. In addition, this project is designed for all those who want to have a physical mini-market where they can sell everything they want in a very different way than usual.
OOp helps you to make money in a simple and quick way if the product you want to sell likes the person interested in buying. This new system of sale consists of a box office-transparent small shop, a smartphone and an App that you can download for free on your mobile. In the OOpApp you can see the catalogue of products, both that are in the box for immediate purchase and those you can book choosing the one you want to take you to your address. If you like what you see inside the box office you only have to make the purchase through the payment gateway of the OOpApp and the system will allow you to open the door of the box office and pick up the product; So easy and simple. Our automated business module is protected by the Patent and Trademark Office and you will only have to decide where you are going to sell your item, set up the box office and make money. We are two entrepreneurs who met two years ago and since then we have developed this exciting project in which we believe and we have the full confidence that it will be a success. 
 This campaign acquires for us a vital aspect, since with the accomplishment of the objective we will be able to realize our dream of being able to carry out a project that helps to any person, company or commerce to generate income of different form. For us the help of the collaborators is fundamental. Without them many projects that have been beneficial to society would not have seen the light. It is also necessary to give the merit that Indeagogo deserves because it performs a very important task for countless entrepreneurs who do not have access to financing to carry out their project. We are convinced that our OOp project, your smart box office, is necessary because it applies the collaborative economy as a sales strategy, which is so necessary to take advantage of synergies and that can help traditional commerce so that it can sell more like any entrepreneur than with the minimum Economic risk can start a business. Our twenty-year experience has focused on the financial sector. 
  This experience brings us knowledge to carry out this project, assuming the lowest possible risks. We think that any idea or dream that you want to realize and carry out has to excite and motivate you every day, trying to make that dream not become a nightmare. Any project, although born of a good idea is not exempt of risks, but in our case with the financial experience that we possess and with the prudence that characterizes us in any strategic decision making we think that we minimize to the maximum any difficulty that can present. The discipline in our work and a positive attitude to the problems that may arise, are values that help us overcome the difficult path of carrying out an idea. We would be eternally grateful if you shared with all your friends and acquaintances this project through the means and channels that you consider. For us it is very valuable that you help us to spread our campaign in Indiegogo. We thank you in advance and we encourage you to collaborate with us. We are waiting for you in the Family OOp ¡¡

961,1704339035,"About our project:
We are creating a pre apocalyptic Quarantine room that will introduce the protagonist and his team. We are using a 1994 Blue Bird Real Prison Bus for the ""Quarantine Prison Bus"". This will enhance the players sense of immersion since they are in a place that is 100% authentic. Also, we are using sounds and lights to enhance the immersion even further. 
Please see below a short description of the story:
12 hours after the breakout  
Do you think Chernobyl was an accident? You are so naive! It was a cover up to something much much bigger. It was a desperate attempt to contain an out of control virus. Now, years later, the Russian intelligence found me and my team of scientists. They have infiltrated the FBI and managed to have us arrested and exposed to the virus. The incubation period is 60 minutes, think Kotov, THINK.
About the location:  
We are currently building this room in a 1994 Blue Bird real prison bus, this will enhance the players sense of immersion since they are in a place that is 100% authentic. The bus will be anchor in St Petersburg and will be rotating throughout all the major cities around Tampa Bay."
962,781264818,"This Make 100 offering is for one-hundred little abstract expressionist paintings in my 2020 Enchanted Forests series.
I'm Linda Hewitt, a freelance writer and artist specializing in abstract expressionist paintings that share the mystery and exuberance of nature. I've been selling my original art at shows, online, and/or by commission since 2000. These Enchanted Forests paintings are among my favorite subject matter. There's something that's both intriguing and unsettling about the way woods change according to weather, season, and time of day, as if each part of the wood at any given time has its own particular personality. Perhaps that's why I've always found such delight in them - they're never boring and bring unexpected pleasures everywhere you look.
For this Make 100 Kickstarter campaign, I'm creating one-hundred original paintings of Enchanted Forests in their many and varied moods. Five will be 3"" x 5"" in size, five will be 4"" x 6"", and five will be 5"" x 7"". Eighty-five will be in what's known as ACEO or Artist Trading Card size - 2-1/2"" x 3-1/2"". They're called Artist Trading Cards because traditionally, for centuries, they were how many artists around the world traded examples of their work with one another.
HERE'S THE LOWDOWN ON MY 2-1/2"" X 3-1/2"" ART-CARD PAINTINGS:
The subject matter includes scenes from my Enchanted Forests 2020 series.
The style is abstract expressionist, and the paintings are multi-layered for a subtle effect.
Paintings vary in mood, intensity, and colors.
Paintings may be had in either horizontal or vertical format.
The medium is the highest-quality acrylic, metallics, and inks on Fabriano cold press watercolor paper.
Each painting will be signed by me.
Each painting will have a Certificate of Authenticity on the back, with the series date and number, personally signed by me.
Backers can choose: (a) the format - vertical or horizontal; and (b) the theme for each card they buy (see WHICH THEME DO YOU WANT?, below). Which art cards featuring a particular theme will be sent to which backers will be random.
The artwork is unframed but is sturdy enough to display on stands or even to hang.
Each painting will be presented in a super thick 3"" x 4"" toploading holder and shipped via USPS First Class Mail.
The plan is to have all paintings delivered no later than the end of May.
The larger paintings in this year's series will be as above save for the sizes: 3"" x 5""; 4"" x 6"";  and 5"" x 7"" and a delivery date of June. These larger sizes of paintings, properly packed, will also be shipped via USPS First Class Mail.
CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICITY. Each painting, of whatever size, will have an artist-signed Certificate of Authenticity affixed to the back.  
Certificate of Authenticity to be affixed to back of each painting
NOTE:  You can elect to buy five of the 2-1/2"" x 3-1/2"" Artist Trading Cards and save shipping costs.
THE ENCHANTED FORESTS VIDEO. The video shows a selection of images suggesting their brilliance and variety, as well as the range of images within themes.
WHICH THEME AND FORMAT DO YOU WANT?  There are many themes that suggest themselves when I begin to paint. Several, however, come up repeatedly, as follows:
 Winter - Cool, silvery trees with dark blue sky 
Example of ""Winter"" theme
 Spring - Pale coppery-green trees with pale blue sky 
Example of ""Spring"" theme
 Summer - Golden-green trees with warm dawn sky 
Example of ""Summer"" theme
 Autumn - Russet trees with blue-green sky 
Example of ""Autumn"" theme
 Emergence - Forest rearranges itself with vivid colors of varying hues and intensities 
Example of ""Emergence"" theme


 Gold Dust - Thick green foliage highlighted in gold, with gold frame around three or four sides 
Example of ""Gold Dust"" theme
 Mystery - Closely grown dark green-and-purple wood with thick undergrowth 
Example of ""Mystery"" theme
Surprise me! - This may be from any of the above themes or something completely different.
Each card in each theme is unique, with the similarity relating to general approach and colors used.
CHOOSE PREFERRED THEME ON SURVEY. At successful conclusion of project, backers will be sent a survey allowing them to choose which theme they prefer for the paintings they've bought. If only one painting has been bought, they can choose one theme and one orientation. If more than one painting has been bought, they can choose one theme and one orientation for each painting bought.
MY GOAL WITH ENCHANTED FORESTS. My goal in this series is to suggest the mystery and ambiguity that's found in forests. This is my first Kickstarter art project, and I'm really looking forward to seeing who shares my love of these enchanted woodlands!
MY INSPIRATION. We live in an area of North Carolina so remote, mountainous, and inaccessible that it was once known as The Lost Province. It's a place of rocky ridges, steep slopes, dark declivities, narrow paths, long views, and valleys of every size. Here's the valley that we overlook to the east.
Our view of the valley to the east
Save for a few grassy balds, this area was originally covered in thick forests and has since the eighteenth century attracted commercial enterprises that came to exploit its oak, maple, beech, chestnut, ash, locust, black walnut, and other hardwoods. Today, it's a leading producer of Christmas trees - mostly the Fraser Fir  - and has stretches of white pines promoted to farmers by the USDA in the 1970s.
The climate is conducive to rapid tree growth; even clear-cut areas begin to regenerate within two to three years. Our best guess is that our small part of it has probably been logged at least two or three times, but each time a handful of trees have survived, leaving us with a very mixed woodland that under different conditions can seem anything from young to ancient and from happy and bright to sad and soft. Here are slivers of our place's moods throughout the year.
Slices of what we see throughout the year
Look in one direction one time, and you want to explore these cheerful precincts. Look in another direction or at a different time, and you want only to go inside and - paintbrush in hand - sit by the fire, grateful for the heavy log walls that hold back the weather and the night."
963,103372022,"Kalsada offers a new specialty coffee origin with a social mission to bring Philippine coffee to the international stage. We work closely with farmers to produce the highest quality specialty coffee in the Philippines. Help us raise $15,000 to build much needed infrastructure for our farm partners to take their coffee from good to great.
It all started when Kalsada’s co-founder, Carmel Laurino, then a student at the University of Washington, came upon this 1909 photograph of Philippine coffee vendors in Pike Place Market. The photo sparked so many questions: Who were these men? And what were they doing in the same market where Starbucks would open shop 60 years later?
Photograph courtesy of: Museum of History & Industry, PEMCO Webster & Stevens Coll.
With this photo in mind a few years later, Carmel started an online blog as a way to get creative minds thinking about Philippine coffee.
Among the new members was Lacy Wood, a Paris-based coffee connoisseur who could bring in the necessary technical background and industry experience to push the project forward.
Less than a year later and with small financial contributions from close friends and family, she and Carmel moved to Manila, despite their online-only communication up to that point. Together they would get to come to know the Philippine coffee industry first-hand.
A bright young Manila local, Tere, joined the team and quickly grew into a coffee aficionado. She began with cupping and roasting, and soon became a trusted source of knowledge for growers on quality growing techniques.
The Kalsada Team has spent one year researching the market and another year building relationships with farmers. After a thorough selection process, we are bringing you the tastiest coffees the Philippines has to offer.
Kalsada’s core team, Carmel, Lacy, and Tere, gelled in just one year as we established ourselves as advocates for high quality Philippine coffee. We collected coffee samples, roasted coffee for the local specialty market, and learned about the experience of stakeholders at every level - farmers, co-ops, local and national government officials, and industry leaders.
We have a story we’d love to share with the world. That story starts with a photo and ends with a cup of coffee.
Auntie Rosita, Mt. Province Philippines
A Grower's Story
Auntie Rosita has a successful roadside stand. She grows coffee and works with her neighbors to collectively find buyers and seek higher prices.
While every farmer has a unique story, Auntie Rosita's infrastructure needs for growing higher quality coffee echo much of what we’ve seen across our farm partners.
Her family is fortunate to have almost 10 hectares of coffee planted, but she never has enough help to harvest it all. Her children pick some, but they make their living outside of agriculture. Auntie Rosita and her husband do much of the work themselves: pruning and weeding year round. Once every year, they harvest, depulp, dry, and dehull the coffee -- without any machines.
Auntie Rosita hopes that her children will one day take an interest in coffee so that they may see value in what she has worked so hard to build.
Kalsada provides low-cost, high-impact technology to increase the quality and value of the local coffee.
Currently most farmers dry their coffee on bilao, or woven bamboo baskets. This dries the coffee much too quickly--essentially pre-baking it in the sun and giving the coffee a papery, cardboard taste.
With simple technology and a bit of training, farmers have a better chance of evenly drying their coffee. Easy interventions like this $30 drying bed can drastically improve quality and increase the value of their coffee.
Already, Kalsada has built raised drying beds and has begun educating farmers on quality. We would like to expand our efforts and focus on one community to produce outstanding coffee. By bringing these resources to one small village, we can control quality and bring a much higher-value coffee to market.
Your contributions will help us build a small, inexpensive washing station that would centralize resources and knowledge. It would save the farmers time and labor, while bringing their unique coffee to aficionados like you.
DRINK WELL PLAYLIST
Carefully curated by Fiona Le Brun, these songs have been put together to perfectly accompany your morning brew. Drink in new tunes from artists like: Naomi Wachira, The Dove and The Wolfe, Courtney Marie Andrews, and more.
INAUGURAL COLLECTION
Our Inaugural Collection includes two 3.5 oz (100g) tins from each coffee growing region.
Benguet
Coffee from Benguet is generally semi-washed which gives it a rich honey-like mouthfeel with notes of tropical fruit and vanilla.
Mt. Province
Mt. Province’s higher elevation gives the coffee a peppery aroma with bright green apple top notes and a rich caramel body.
AFICIONADO COLLECTION
For those that know their coffee, we will give you a two month subscription of a 12 oz (340g) bag from our reserve collection. After a highly selective process, we set aside the best micro-lots and pay these farmers a higher price for their coffee. Let us send you one bag a month for two months.

We invite any Pacific Northwest locals to join us for a dinner, artfully prepared by the young and talented chef Aaron Verzosa of Modernist Cuisine. Join us for this three-course meal crafted from seasonal selections, accompanied by thoughtfully paired wines, and shared over conversation about the future of Kalsada and our journey thus far. The dinner is limited to 10 people, hosted in Seattle on the 11th of April 2015. (Note: This does not include transportation to Seattle).
COFFEE ADVENTURE
Have your own coffee adventure in the Philippines. We will take you to visit our farmer partners in Mt. Province so that you can experience a home-stay in our highest altitude community. Admire the view of the rice terraces from a community that is building shade covered coffee terraces to further their economic needs in an environmentally sustainable way. Meet a local roaster entrepreneur that has been roasting and buying arabica coffee in Sagada for over a decade. Transportation from Manila, accommodation, and food (including dinner at the famous Yogurt House in Sagada) is all included for this four day coffee adventure. (Note: International airfare to the Philippines is not included).

965,315664866,"A longform piece of journalism including text, photographs and video.
I intend to break a very important story, bringing to light possibly impeachable facts which destroy the very foundation of Donald Trump's credibility and fitness for office.
President Donald Trump has been criticised for the amount of time he spends playing golf -- an accusation he himself levelled numerous times against his predecessor Obama, though neither of them comes close to the prodigious golfing of Wilson and Eisenhower.
Trump claims to hold a golfing handicap (a way of scoring players against each other even if they play at different courses) of between 3 and 4 - placing him somewhere in the 5-10th percentile, an impressive achievement for a man in his 70s. This would rank him amongst professional golfers and serious amateurs.
But others (notably rocker Alice Cooper) have accused Trump of cheating at golf, and a signed scorecard indicating his prowess has never been produced.
This multi-platform project will be a deep investigative report into the Commander In Chief's golf score, in a potentially explosive expose which gets to the heart of the President's credibility, character and backswing.
Does he shank his drives? Does he use a wood off the fairway or stick to irons? Does he tend to hook or draw his strokes (generally biased left or right?). Does he take his victories with class and defeats in his stride? Is it true that his caddy is a Russian spy?
By good old fashioned shoe-leather reporting, I will collect the deep dirt, and discover once and for all whether the President's golf game is as good as the cut of his suits and the knot of his tie."
966,95462370,"Coming Soon: Moderation Brewing!
Before Prohibition, Mainers gathered in small neighborhood breweries for freshly brewed beer and conversation. These local establishments were beacons: they brought people together in the twilight hours after long days, inviting friends new and old to relax and enjoy the good times together. Today, Moderation Brewing is reviving those time-honored traditions in our taproom and brewery, which dates back to 1880 and originally served as an American Express office for the town of Brunswick, Maine. (It’s likely that countless packages filled with moonshine passed through our doors and into Maine’s ports, carried by defiant bootleggers until the day beer came back.) Mainers love great beer, and we’re proud of our independent businesses and local agriculture. That’s why we’re passionate about bringing you fresh, locally made and sourced craft brews in a variety of styles.Moderation Brewing is re-energizing downtown Brunswick as its only walkable and bikeable downtown destination taproom. We're brewing top-notch fresh craft beer with local malted barley, hops, and yeast strains, and bringing people together in our taproom and outdoor beer garden. We're the place for great pints in a packed house full of friends.
Original Building circa 1900
What in Tarnation is Moderation?
Moderation Brewing is built on a fifteen-year- old best friendship between Mattie and Philip, both lifelong Brunswick residents. Philip’s an avid brewer and caretaker of the “Hop Monster,” a twenty-year- old Cascade Vine, and his own carefully cultivated library of brettanomyces-focused yeasts. Mattie is currently serving her third term in the Maine State Legislature, representing Brunswick, and she’s run her own business for over a decade. She’s a vocal advocate for local food systems and an ace photographer.  
Moderation will be one of very few breweries not located in an industrial park, and we envision that our small home will be a center of the community. We take that commitment seriously, and plan to use locally sourced grains, and to return our spent grain, hops, and yeast to local farmers for feed and fertilizer. As a walkable downtown destination, we’re the perfect spot to grab a beer before dinner, after work, or while leaf peeping up the coast of Maine.  
Downtown Brunswick
The beers are diverse, anchored by a flagship Brett-fermented red ale. Philip’s personal catalogue of beer recipes includes over 50 original varieties, including staples like New England IPAs and pale ales, and adventurous takes on classics, such as a Blonde Stout that defies categorization. The space is hand-built, welcoming, and lively—we plan to offer local art exhibitions, and open the space for gatherings, fundraisers, and celebrations.
Brettanomyces-Mosaic IPA
We Can Get There From Here
We’re almost there—after three years of blood, sweat, and beers, not to mention our life’s savings—Moderation Brewing has an incredible home, a rock solid business plan, and some next-level equipment and tools for our brewery. We’re so close to the finish line, we can almost taste those first cold beers on opening day.
White Ale with Maine Ginger
   We can’t do it without our community. Like any business with a story worth telling, we’ve encountered surprises—like a commercial space with such history that we’ve had to remove the equivalent of three buildings nested inside each other to get down to those 1880s studs. We’re rebuilding the brewery floor from scratch to support the brewing equipment, which has added time and cost to the project. We’ve done much of the work ourselves, with help from some wonderful family and friends, and our fantastic contractor Pat. It’s finally happening, but we’re running out of funds for extras like our beer garden furnishings.
More than anything, Moderation Brewing belongs to our community, and we want to give you a chance to invest now in making history. Your generous pledge will help to cover our final costs and put the final touches on something special.

Why Autism awareness? Aarons two youngest sons, Thomas and Joshua were both diagnosed with Autism. Therefore, Autism awareness is very close to home for both Aaron and Craig.
As we all know, our community has been in need of a pool hall for quite some time. Our options have become less and less as the years go by. We, as true pool players, have been asking for a place we can call our own. A place where the refreshments are actually fresh. A place where the pool players (you) come first. With your help, D&D Billiards can be that place.
We will hold Leagues, tournaments and other competitive events! D&D billiards will be open to all players of varying skill levels to come and have fun and relax!

969,1681749006,"In the spring of 2014, I learned that I had been selected for the Doug Varone and Dancers mentoring program called DEVICES: Choreographic Intensive (CHIN)! I was one of 16 choreographers who had been chosen to work directly with Doug Varone and his dancers, receive individual mentoring from Doug himself, and ultimately present a new work at 92nd Street Y in NYC.  In May 2014, we all participated in the intensive part of the program....creating, moving, challenging, remembering how to play in the dance studio. After this intense process, I returned home completely inspired and excited to get started on a new work applying all that I had been exploring. 
Three amazing dance artists, Michelle Pritchard, Kelly Johnson, and Alaina Olivieri have joined me on this new adventure and we have been rehearsing since May. In July, I received my first feedback from Doug and the video above is from our most recent rehearsal. I now have a better understanding of where I want to go with this work and am taking his advice to continue challenging myself. There is much to do still, but I am thrilled at the direction we are going and am so happy to be collaborating with such beautiful, talented, creative artists, which leads me to the funding part of this story.
From September 12-14, 2014, we will have the opportunity to premiere this work in New York City. To say that this is a dream come true for me is an absolute understatement! Words cannot adequately express how much it means to me to be showing my choreography in the company of so many artists I admire and respect. It is also difficult for me to describe how much the dedication, time and energy of my dancers means to me. They have all made personal and professional sacrifices to participate in this project and deserve to be compensated. I am hoping to pay them for rehearsals, 2 performances, and travel expenses.  As I am still in the emerging stages of my company, I do not have fiscal sponsorship and so I am supporting my artistic life on an adjunct salary. I know that in the months and years to follow, I will become more adept at grant writing, fundraising, etc., but for now, I am giving this a try! I will be eternally grateful for any donations to help me reach my goal and fulfill my dream. Thank you so much for your support!
Here is more information about the CHIN project and how Doug Varone and Dancers were funded to create opportunities like this for artists like me:
""On September 12-14, 2014, Doug Varone and Dancers presents the works of 16 hand-selected emerging choreographers in the CHIN Project, the culminating event of the DEVICES: Choreographic Intensive (CHIN). DEVICES: Choreographic Intensive is a mentoring program of Doug Varone and Dancers, made possible with generous funding support from the New York Community Trust. The program is supported, in part, by public funds from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs, in partnership with the City Council. The CHIN Project is presented in partnership with the 92nd Street Y."""
970,1864945003,"Artistic Director Jim May and the Anna Sokolow Theatre/Dance Ensemble is seeking support for the company's reconstruction of choreographer Anna Sokolow's seminal work Odes (1965) not performed since 1968. Odes is a work in three parts set to scores by contemporary music pioneer Edgar Varèse and the second installment in a live music for dance initiative appropriately titled ""Sounds of Sokolow"", a collaboration with members of Fusion Bande under the direction of Kenneth Hamrick. This program underscores Ms. Sokolow's close artistic and personal relationships with the composers and artists of her day; with Odes she expresses her surprising reflection on Greek Theater and Sculpture and a ""powerful work about civilzation."" 
  Please help us bring this much anticipated revival of Odes, a classic work of modern dance, back to the stage. Your donation will go directly to supporting the live music provided by members of Fusion Bande and help cover the costs of an expanded company of 23 dancers required to perform the dance. Not seen for over 40 years, Odes should prove a revelation for a new generation of dance enthusiasts.

Per i nostri amici italiani

Cari amici oltremare, vi scriviamo per chiedere un piccolo contibuto per la compagnia Sokolow Theatre/Dance Ensemble che sta cercando di raccogliere $5,500 per avere musica dal vivo ai nostri prossimi spettacoli dal 10 al 13 novembre 2011. Le donazioni vengono fatte tramite un sito web (kickstarter) dove chi vuole puo’ donare dei soldi (facendo un pegno); se non si raggiunge la cifra di $5,500 per il 5 novembre il tutto si cancella automaticamente. Anche una piccola contibuzione aiuta!

Lo spettacolo presentera’ una coreografia di Anna Sokolow del 1965 (Odes), che non e’ stata vista dal 1968. Il nostro direttore artistico, Jim May, faceva parte del cast originale, ed e’ un onore per noi imparare da lui questa meravigliosa danza creata per 23 danzatori. Anna Sokolow e’ stata una delle coreografe piu’ influenti del ventesimo secolo negli Stati Uniti: il suo lavoro combina la modern dance con teatro, musica, poesia ed arte. Ha influenzato la grande coreografa tedesca Pina Bausch e ha partecipato nella creazione di molti musicals, incluso  il famoso “Hair” negli anni ‘60. Ci ha lasciato nel 2000 a 90 anni; la sua ultima coreografia risale al 1998.
Aiutaci a raggiungere questa cifra e a presentare questa bellissima coreografia con musica dal vivo! Per fare il vostro pegno, cliccate su “back this project” e seguite le istruzioni in inglese. Purtroppo non ci sono istruzioni in italiano. Naturalmente avete bisogno di una carta di credito.
Ringraziamo tutti di cuore!! E ovviamente siete tutti invitati agli spettacoli...:)

971,1985073479,"Hi! We're Toe the Line and we're on a mission to set #TheNewStandard from the ankles down! After a successfully launching two chapters of socks, we're ready to launch Chapter 3 featuring some of our favourite Aussie animals. But this time, we're doing things a bit differently - by getting you, our fans, involved! We've got the samples made, and production is ready to go. Now all we need is your help to make Chapter 3 a reality!
When we started Toe the Line in 2017, we were two mates that were sick of having to wear the boring black sock. The idea was formed while at a Melbourne Cup function in 2016. We noticed the crowd were well dressed, but lacked ~flair~ in their sock game. From here, the inspiration for Toe the Line was formed, where we aim to set #TheNewStandard from ankles down. 
We reached out to Georgie, our now Chief Sock Designer at Toe the Line, and began working on Chapter 1. Finally, in September 2017 we launched with 8 socks featuring designs from fairy bread and fruits to totally wacky patterns. Chapter 2 followed soon in February of 2018 featuring our fluffiest four legged friends. And now we're ready for the next Chapter.
We've produced what we think are our best designs yet. Our Aussie animals cop a bad reputation for being some of the world's deadliest creatures. While this may be true, you'd be surprised how cute they look on a pair of Toe the Line socks. We can't wait to get these socks manufactured, packed and sent to you. 
You may have seen us in...
Can't pick? 
Don't worry you don't have to choose which designs you want till the campaign is over! 
For our biggest fans out there, we want to reward you with you with some early bird prices for bundles of socks:
 Super Early Bird Special - If you back the campaign within the first 24 hours, you'll receive your socks for 25% off the full price!
 Early Bird Special - After the first 24 hours, the next 50 backers will be able to receive 20% off. 
 KickStarter Special - Once the Early Bird Specials run out, we'll be offering our Kickstarter special price at 10% off full price for the rest of the campaign. 
Bundles of 5 socks or more will receive a discount of 20%  for the whole campaign! 
Don't worry you don't have to choose which designs you want till the campaign is over! 
We've helped you do the maths, this shows you prices of socks bundles under the Super Early Bird and Early Bird Specials! 
Our Kickstarter Specials are still a cool 10% of our retail prices for bundles of 1 -4 pairs of socks or 20% for bundles of 5 or more socks, be sure not to miss out! 
We ship anywhere in the world for a flat fee of $25. Shipping is FREE for all Australian orders with 2 or more Pairs. Orders with one pair in Australia will incur a $8 flat fee. 
If we raise our goal of $2,500, you'll will be able to access 3 of our amazing designs, the Crocodile, Quokka and Platypus. In order to unlock the further 2 designs we need your help to get to  Stretch Goal 1 at $3,000 and Stretch Goal 2 at $3,250. At $3,250 you'll be able to choose any of the 5 designs at the completion of this Kickstarter campaign. 
All of our socks come in a one size fits most option. The designs are unisex and should fit men and women between a size  7 - 13. A unique blend of double combed cotton, nylon and spandex gives our socks the softness and comfort that will make you keep them on all day long. They're also strong and stretchy enough to keep up with you and your busy life.  "

Manifiesto
¿Qué será de nosotros en el futuro? Nadie lo sabe. Probablemente un día desaparezcamos, como otras especies y civilizaciones han desaparecido antes, pero ¿qué pasará con todo lo que construímos y dejamos como rastro de nuestra existencia? La naturaleza salvaje reconquistará su territorio y poco a poco, esas estructuras que hoy son edificios, se erosionarán y serán suelo fértil para las plantas que se apoderen de ellos.
Por medio de estructuras verticales con una textura que simula el efecto del tiempo y semillas que se convertirán en plantas que desbordarán dichas estructuras, esta pieza enuncia una respuesta posible a la pregunta planteada.
___
Manifesto
What will become of humanity in the future?, no-one can know. We will most likely vanish as other species and civilizations have vanished before, but what will happen with everything we have built and left behind as a trace of our existence? An untamed nature will re-conquer its territory and little by little, the structures that today are buildings, will erode and become fertile ground for plants to seize them.
Made out of vertical structures that remind us of buildings, with a texture representing the passing of time, this piece gives a possible answer to our first question.
***La dimensiones son aproximadas en cm***
***Dimensions are in cm and may vary from the final result ***
""On the day after humans disappear, nature takes over and immediately begins cleaning house ––or houses, that is. Cleans them right off the face of the Earth. They all go""
—Alan Weisman, The World Without Us.
Mi inspiración viene de lugares que han sido invadidos por la naturaleza, algunos por abandono o descuido, otros con la intención de ser invadidos. Una vez que la mano del hombre no esté presente no habrá manera de frenar el crecimiento desmesurado de las plantas y el desmoronamiento del las estructuras.
___
Mi inspiration comes from places that have been invaded by nature, some due to abandonment or lack of maintenance, some others with the intention of being invaded. The fact is that there is no way of controlling erosion and the overflowing growth of nature, once there is no one to control it.

974,1482611116,"Greetings! The third annual residency for the International Interdisciplinary Artists Consortium is happening August 16th – 20th at Earthdance- an artist-run retreat center in Western Massachusetts. Fifteen other artists from Brazil, Colombia, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands and the U.S. (California, Massachusetts and New York) will join me for four days of exchanging approaches to making work and to engage in dialogue sessions about interdisciplinary performance and its role in education. Immediately following our time together, we will serve as teachers for the Moving Arts Lab, August 20th – 23rd - a three day festival of workshops open to the general public. Included in the weekend is a larger dialogue session, sharing our findings from the residency with all of the participants, and opening the floor to discuss the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in our world today. We will also offer a faculty performance.
I need your support to cover travel expenses for all of the residency artists/teachers, plus room and board at Earthdance during our stay. Last year I succeeded in running a successful campaign, and this year, I want to challenge myself to raise enough to expand a vision that I have been honing for the last five years. What’s different this year is that all of the teachers for the Moving Arts Lab will be present for the residency, whereas in years past, some artists only participated as teachers for the Lab.
In a culture that regularly devalues artists and their contributions, it has been important to me to provide this opportunity to artists without them having to incur any out-of-pocket expenses. The residency and lab are spaces where we can continue to identify and support the values that we share, and that are in danger of being lost to a society of distraction and instant gratification.
In terms of background:
The International Interdisciplinary Artists Consortium (IIAC) is a network of performing and creative artists, educators and producers working across artistic disciplines and continental divides. The objective of the IIAC is three-fold:
-to engage in artists' residencies that offer opportunities for knowledge exchange which feed into larger social and educational structures (i.e. workshops, festivals and academia)
-to identify and sustain methods for sharing resources and values
-to expand a network of partners
Established in 2012, the IIAC has since grown to include 42 artists living and/or working in such countries as Australia, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Cuba, Curaçao, England, Finland, Italy, Japan, Macedonia, Mexico, Poland, Puerto Rico, Serbia, Sri Lanka, Switzerland, and Uruguay, and from within the U.S. in states including California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York and Pennsylvania.
This year's roster includes Michelle Boulé, Krista DeNio, Debra Disbrow, Conrado Falbo, Ximena Garnica, Shige Moriya, Martín Lanz Landázuri, Ursula Eagly, Abigail Levine, Odeya Nini, Emily Sweeney, Tatyana Tenenbaum, Petra Van Noort, Larissa Velez-Jackson and Sarah Young

976,20287849,"This book / story will become a Hollywood movie. Not because it’s about me or because I wrote it, or that I am someone special, unique or different.The reason is because consciousness awakenings are happening to more and more western people who have little or no understanding of what is happening to them, nor do they have the ability to recognize it in others. There is one consciousness manifesting in all of us and in mankind as a collective whole. It's nature is to evolve. As the understanding of its manifestation becomes more and more prevalent in western culture, the relevance of the higher teachings of the east becomes paramount.  Sooner or later in this lifetime or another, circumstances in your life will force you as an individual expression of consciousness, to evolve into the non linear subjective state of conscious awareness. The details will be different but there is only one truth, one consciousness, and it’s evolving through you right now.
It matters not if you are Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Jew, or practice no formal religion or spirituality at all. You are part of It… You won’t leave here by death but by transcendence. I am an educated westerner, holding several professional licenses, numerous patent. I have been a business owner, steeped in capitalism and entrenched in the Newtonian paradigm of intellect, logic, and reason. The following excerpt from my book is only one of many experiences that has forced the quest for understanding the truth of who and what we are. There is no stone left unturned questioning reality, sanity, truth, and purpose.
I was driving home from my David Hawkins study group, and was having trouble determining what was real and what was; what I would call transparencies. If you have ever seen auras before, I would describe these transparencies as being something similar, only they would surround various objects, although some were not associated with any objects or form at all. I wasn’t really aware of it at the time because all seemed real, or at least appeared to have form. I was pretty confident that I was on the right road and headed in the right direction but my sense of space and location seemed to be in another dimension. I had been seeing these transparencies for about a year now, mostly in the morning while driving to work. They would usually fade away when I looked directly at them. Tonight, they were not fading away. 
I made a left turn onto what I thought was the turn to go home. I proceeded straight ahead and I saw a pair of headlights in the immediate distance pointing directly into my eyes. I had turned down the left side of a divided highway and was going head on into oncoming traffic. I immediately pulled a u turn and was able to right myself onto the correct side of the road, but was unable to determine exactly where home was. I knew I was in the area but the ability to rely on my sense of location, logic and linear thought was an impossibility. Time, space, and location which are linear were not accessible to a nonlinear state of mind, that I appeared to be in. I had been in this nonlinear subjective state of thought many times before but had always been able to get to where I needed to be. To use logical sequential thought while you are in a state outside of time and space is not possible. 
I wish I could explain how I got home but there simply is not the ability to describe it in language. The closest linear concept understandable would be that of relying on intuition. Even this is not an adequate description. It’s like there is an intuitive sensing that takes place outside of logical sequential thinking. It appears to act outside of time, space, and location. It is truly outside of the ability of language to give adequate description. This intuition comes from a source beyond the thinking mind. 
Implosion
The removal of form. I sit here in the one room that I rent, in a home that I don't own, with a coffee pot, a microwave, and a picture tube tv. It's not a fancy flat screen either. Counting all of the clothes I have, it would take fifteen minutes to load all of it into my 16-year-old Honda civic with no air conditioning and no radio, and drive to Alaska. Maybe, it would be cooler there!. I have 21 dollars in the bank until my next pay check which is a week from now.
On April 16, 2006, the upstairs bathroom toilet seat had broken and I took the brand-new Chrysler 300 we had purchased the day before to Lowe’s, to buy a new toilet seat. The car had less than 100 miles on it. Our three-story home in a fancy suburb of Atlanta was the center home of the cul-de-sac. As I drove up the hill to the house, I proceeded to enter the driveway that had a steep slope down into the garage. I suddenly felt this (lump) thump, and heard the sound of an aluminum lawn chair crunching and an awful groan. More like an oh shit?. Oooooh shiiiit! Oh shit! I realized that the car was on top of my wife Liz and that the only way to get it off her was to back up, so I backed up.
It was a beautiful Easter Sunday in Atlanta and Liz had decided to sun bath in the driveway, on one of those low beach chairs. It was impossible to see her the way the driveway slopped into the garage. Her shoulder was fractured in several places, she had several broken ribs, a broken tail bone, and a torn femoral artery. The good news was she did not have brain damage nor any paralysis. She was alive but barely. After surgery, she spent about a week on the surgical recovery floor and was then moved to ICU. I'm not sure exactly how long she was in the hospital, but after discharge, she was confined to a hospital bed at home in the living room. We had visiting nurses who tended to her until the insurance company stopped paying. Upon being discharged, Liz had been home only a few hours when she was on her way back to the hospital via ambulance due to excruciating pain. The broken bones and torn artery were causing horrific problems, and the road rash was so extensive that the nurses had to train me on wound care, so I could tend to her when my insurance ran out.
As she was going through surgery that evening, I received a call from the insurance company. They informed me that the call would be recorded. So, I was forced to relive the accident in slow motion and in graphic detail. This detail included what Lowe’s I had gone to, what isle I had shopped in, what toilet seat did I purchase, the color, and how much I paid for it. I took the call in the hall of the hospital and once it ended I found myself on the floor. About two weeks after the surgery, I was driving in to see Liz and my mind was spinning like crazy with so much on my plate. The police questioned me. The police questioned Liz asking her if she wanted to press charges. My kids had probably talked about the accident at school and DFCS showed up at my house. Financial pressures, on and on, and all of a sudden, it felt like all the circuits in my brain fired all at once. My mind crashed. I’m not even sure to this day exactly what happened to me. I couldn't figure out if I should continue to drive to the hospital, eat something, lay down, call someone, or if I had to go to the bathroom. Somehow, I made it to the hospital. I was walking down the hall and one of the nurses I had come to know saw me and asked me if I was ok. I said no. She literally took me by my arm and walked me to the emergency room. I was treated in ER but I'm not exactly sure what they gave me. The brain crash came back periodically for the next few years but it was never as intense as the first one. I was totally powerless over when it would come and how long it would last. The only way I can describe it is that it felt like all the circuits in my mind fired all at once and fried my brain. It seemed like I needed to be rebooted.
Last fall second daughter was abducted from the local Walmart at knife point, assaulted, raped and dropped off naked in a parking lot begging for her life. After several weeks had passed, and with help from local media coverage, they found the suspect in a hotel room, by identifying her stolen car in the parking lot. His picture and the kidnaping had been captured on the Walmart cameras. The picture used by the media to ID the guy had been taken from the grocery store camera of him using her credit cards. He was charged with 7 felonies for this one incident. Several of the charges carried thirty years to life, if convicted. She now has a hand gun with a carry permit and knows how to use it.
Shortly after my daughter's kidnapping, my 20 year old son  was coming home from work on his motorcycle and was hit at an intersection by someone making a left turn across traffic on a divided highway. I suppose that as far as motorcycle accidents go, he came out pretty well. The worst of the injuries were severed tendons in his right hand that required surgical pins, all of which resulted in permanent loss of mobility in one of his fingers.
My youngest daughter (who I haven't seen in several years) was married at age 21 to a gentleman who was associated with what I believe to be a church cult in South Carolina. No one knew when the wedding would be, nor was anyone from her side of the family invited. I have spoken to her once in the last four years and that only took place through her husband acting as an intermediary.
My oldest daughter from my first marriage is a graduate of University of Florida and teaching at the University of California working on her Ph.D. She had dated a young man from the 10th grade, through High School and College, and is now married to him. My wife and I were invited and attended her wedding. As we entered the church and guests were being seated, typically an usher would escort the ladies to their seats. We had not been greeted and were pretty confused as to exactly where to sit. So we just proceeded into the sanctuary and sat down in two vacant seats where available on the brides side about half way up the isle. As the father of the bride I was not involved in any aspect of the wedding, pictures, or reception. Thank God for the grooms family. We sat at the grooms table at the reception and left shortly after.
I had founded and built a company around intellectual property that I had invented. The technology had 12 issued patents. We were working with The Gates Foundation and a think tank group, and had 18 months of field trials in Africa and Southeast Asia completed. My financial position as a result of Liz’s accident was vulnerable and 15 years of blood sweat and tears was compromised by those who would do so. I thought we were on the same team. 
We lost our home of 18 years where we had raised the kids, and the entire family was split apart. Since the year 2006 there has been nothing in my life,  I mean nothing that I could do, to stop, slow down, control, or influence events. No decision, prayer, choice, event, person, circumstance, job, company, anything, anyone, had any impact. Nothing worked for me period! My life had imploded completely. I have moved six times in the last year, lost three generations of inheritance money, been foreclosed upon, and went bankrupt.
Ok God you have my attention!
What is my part? What is it in me that needs to change? The miracle is recognition that I need to change how I think.  
Dear God, I ask you please to help me change how I think. ..."

978,2020403020,"So there I was, in the Crescent City with my dear husband visiting his delightful Aunt Beulah. I won't mention her age, as a lady never tells her age, but let's just say there have been 16 U.S. President's, some with multiple terms, in her lifetime so far.  Being from Los Angeles, I’m used to urban life but New Orleans has a special quality about it that other cities don’t, making this town enticingly different. We were only going to be able to spend one week with Aunt B, as she likes to be called, and on that first morning after our arrival, she asked me if I would like a cup of coffee. I needed something to combat jet-lag, so I replied “Yes ma’am!” I had no idea that I was about to experience some of that New Orleans difference…
I was sitting at Aunt B’s table thinking about some of the things we were going to do that day, and brought the cup to my lips. That first taste had my full attention. I stared into my cup, expecting to see something different, but no, it just appeared to be… coffee. But the taste! WOW! I glanced at my husband and he was just smiling at me, knowing that I had just experienced Aunt B’s Special Coffee. I told Aunt B “This is the best cup of coffee I’ve ever tasted. Do you mind my asking you two things: How do you make it, and may I have another cup?” She laughed and said “Why no, honey! I’ll share my secret with you!” I had another cup as she explained the history of her unique brew.
In New York City, there was an establishment known as the Horn and Hardart Cafeteria. Aunt B had enjoyed the coffee there in the early sixties before moving south to where it didn’t snow. After becoming a “regular” at Horn and Hardart, she watched the head barista prepare their famous coffee, incorporating a single secret ingredient made their coffee stand out from the others. Aunt B learned how to blend the coffee and the “something something” and has kept the recipe close to her heart ever since. This coffee has been enjoyed by Aunt B’s friends and family in New Orleans for many years, and now I look forward to sharing it with my friends and family, and maybe some of you as well! Since I was fortunate enough to marry her favorite nephew, she willingly shared the name of the “special” part with me. I promised that I would not reveal what the secret is, but I can still share small amounts of pre-prepared dry mix of this with a select few of you.  If you are a coffee drinker, you have never tasted anything like this. A rich, buttery flavor unlike any other."
979,1962709963,"Hello, new friends, and welcome to The Iola Project.  
Ravynn tweeted: ""Ugh I just want to get a bunch of Black feminists together and start a site where we write Bitch media quality takes on popular culture but with the interactivity of Buzzfeed.""
Perhaps moments after that tweet, the idea for The Iola Project began taking shape in my mind. 
The idea was simple: I wanted Black feminist popular culture reviews and analysis about all our favorite things on a site where you could do more than just read. I wanted a site that taught readers as much about our Black feminist foremothers as it did about our contemporaries while you perused. And I wanted people to get paid for their time.
In order for such a huge project to get off the ground, I knew I needed help. So I called the baddest Black feminist I knew: Taylor Leigh Lamb. With Taylor’s assistance, The Iola Project began to develop sharper contours and the intentions became clearer. 
From our name, which was derived from Ida B. Wells’ pen name when she wrote for the Memphis Free Speech, to our site colors, which come from Alice Walker’s quote, “Womanist is to feminist as purple is to lavender,” everything that we do at The Iola Project is part of a larger goal of celebrating Black feminism, in all its forms and iterations. In addition to our popular culture reviews and analysis, we will write under Black feminist pseudonyms with an accompanying guide to why we have chosen our names; we will pay homage to our foremothers in our weekly “Letters to the Ancestors” column; and and we will encourage you to, in the wise words of Dr. Claudrena Harold, do the reading by offering up reading lists and reviews of our favorite Black feminist texts.
Ida B. Wells-Barnett
It is important for you to know that this is not a woman’s magazine. This is a Black feminist magazine. If you are Black, identify as a feminist and have all the feelings about popular culture, your words are welcome and valued here. We are seeking to amplify those voices. If you are non-Black, identify as a feminist and have all the feelings about popular culture, join our community.
If our ideas surrounding this project encourage you to follow us on social media, tell a friend, or maybe even donate. It will take $12,000 to cover start up costs and three months worth of content. 
But for something like The Iola Project? I think it’s worth it.

980,1353499934,"How This Came About:
Comprised of the brilliant minds of Bailey Stanfield, Justin Putney, and Dylan Moham (and not to mention, the friends and family supporting!) We were sitting around on a Skype call when Bailey, out of the blue asked, ""Justin, don't your parents have a t-shirt heat press?"" to which Justin answered, ""yes we do, why"". Dylan, almost as if he was anticipating the topic to arise anyway, exclaimed, ""I have been looking at the shirts at school and have thought to myself, HEY I can do that!"" And just like that, the ideas started PUMPING out. Backed with passion and a youthful vision of hope for this becoming much bigger, we came up with a killer name, both intentional in the fact that its an acronym and unique....because it is!
OUR GOAL:
With our goal at $225 we will be using the money for Shirts, Heat applied transfers, and Stickers!
So...What is Quiet Wave Shirt Republic?
It's all in the name! Lets dissect it. 
QWSR: Pronounced <Kwey-Zahr>, like the word Quasar. It's honestly just an awesome acronym.
QUIET WAVE: We are going to release and create each shirt in collections of two. Wave One is what we are starting with (the images pictured) These will be out in June, and we are hoping to have enough funds from the first wave to continue Wave Two that will come out in December!
SHIRT: We sell high-quality shirts, sure to fit your liking!
REPUBLIC: That's where you come in! Each wave we are going to release polls online to hear which shirt of the two was best, and additional feedback is greatly welcomed! "
981,726964322,"    The Back Story
When the going gets tough, the tough get going, and writers write, musicians play and painters paint. Often the best creative work is borne of some sort of angst. For me, this last couple of years has been interesting. My studio has filled with a body of work that I feel should be shown in its entirety. My best friend's battle with cancer lead her (and I) to New York City, a place we'd always meant to visit together. A place where she grew up, and I only read and fantasized about. New York has been both an electric adventure and an exhausting battle ground.  As she braved one harsh situation after another, I, in my front row seat, could only marvel at the shear unfairness of it all, as well as her matter of fact bearing of it. Manhattan just seems like the obvious place to exhibit my blinking responses to what felt very much like falling down Alice's rabbit hole. In some of my paintings I paint of things that perplex me, others, things I was outraged by, or frightened or inspired by, even grateful for. Not all of it illness related. So now I have a good sized series of paintings ready to be displayed, and a very good opportunity to do so in an artsy area in the heart of Manhattan. 
  The Project
So here I am back on Kickstarter trying to raise funds to carry this out. I had previously only contacted galleries and submitted work hoping for the opportunity. Now the opportunity has come to me and I am only held back by the logistics. Transporting large painted canvas, framing, and advertising are part of the equation as well as the space rental. A solo show in New York is a giant undertaking. With the help of my family and my new friends in the NY art biz I am trying to keep the costs as low as I can. Its important that I am clear that I am not doing this with the traditional goal of painting sales. This is much less practical and far more personal than simple commerce. Its also more complicated. I am creating the opportunity for an experience, both for myself and for anyone visiting the space. I am creating a dedication to my best friend and to every other person who has ever courageously pressed on through  harrowing moments in their life . If one person sees one painting and feels lifted or understood or encouraged by it, THAT will make it. I created my art to take myself into and out of the harshness, if you become distracted or uplifted for even one moment, that makes it memorable, and for me, it makes it art.
The Show
The show which has been retitled (again), will be called Out of the Rabbit Hole. This because,  though we certainly appreciate the opportunities we've had to spend time in NY, my friend and I agree, it is time to make our way out and home and onward. The show will open on October 11 and close right around the end of her required  stay. This actually happened by coincidence, ( is there such a thing?) so all will neatly commence together. What better way to celebrate!? I am also in the process of creating a website so anyone can go online and see the paintings, read about them and if they want to, even buy one through amazon or paypal.
Rewards
For pledging  your support for me in this undertaking I want to share my art with you. I will have original paintings, T-shirts, canvas tote bags, even baby onesies with  my paintings printed on them, there will be note cards and signed prints. For anyone wishing they could visit the show but not geograghicaly

able, I will offer a free download or DVD of the opening night. I so appreciate you taking the time to visit my kickstarter sight and hoping with me that I am successful.

982,1267357714,"JUST GIRLY THINGS is a new dance theatre work from the Danielle Georgiou Dance Group (DGDG) that is premiering at the 20th anniversary of the Festival of Independent Theatres at Dallas' Bath House Cultural Center.
JUST GIRLY THINGS will perform on the following dates:
Friday, July 20 at 8:00 p.m. 
Saturday, July 21 at 5:00 p.m.
Sunday, July 22 at 2:00 p.m.
Thursday, July 26 at 8:00 p.m.
Sunday, July 29 at 5:00 p.m.
Saturday, August 4 at 8:00 p.m.
JUST GIRLY THINGS is a devised, collaborative dance theatre piece written by Danielle Georgiou and Ruban Carrazana, with the performers. Original music and lyrics by Justin Locklear, Cory Kosel, and Trey Pendergrass.
This delightfully raw and painfully honest work of dance theatre centers on the complicated relationships between women and the obstacles that they place between each other in an already tenuous environment. Being a woman is a “disadvantage,” or so says society, but is that really true?
Chock full of songs and dance inspired by 1990s pop culture and television sitcoms, this musical comedy shows the lengths women will go to resist disappointment and achieve “perfection.”
Following the tradition of other works from the award-winning company, JUST GIRLY THINGS will explore the themes of its source material by deconstructing the style of a sitcom and presenting a fresh, exciting, and chilling look at pop-culture.

Where will the funds go?
Your donation will go to cover the costs of the production, including costumes, set construction, and to pay fair wages to the performers and designers. We're working hard on our end, but we need your pledge to help make JUST GIRLY THINGS a success!
Kickstarter is a unique platform for funding creative endeavors. In exchange for your support, we offer a variety of rewards--and our endless love! Because funding is all-or-nothing, it is imperative that we raise our full goal of $2,500 to move forward with this project; otherwise, nobody will be charged, and the campaign will not be a success. 100% of the money earned here will go towards building the piece.

984,2025405079,"Hi, I'm Madeline von Foerster, an American painter living in Germany. I make paintings using a 500 year-old mixed technique of oil and egg tempera, invented by the Flemish Masters.
Photo ©Oliver Wachenfeld www.oliverwachenfeld.de
My paintings have contemporary themes: endangered species, vanishing biodiversity, and deforestation. The leitmotif is humanity's troubled relationship to nature; how we can heal it, and ourselves.
In the ""Mische"" technique, as it's known, a detailed underpainting is rendered in tempera on a red ground. This is later enhanced with oil glazes, creating a signature luminance.
My artworks are in collections around the world and have been featured in numerous publications, including ""100 Painters of Tomorrow"" (Thames and Hudson, 2014). I was also the subject of a television portrait on ARTE's ""Metropolis,"" broadcast in Germany and France. 
ABOUT THIS CAMPAIGN:
I've been working since 2014 on a series of paintings entitled Uprooted, which will be exhibited at the Academy Art Museum in Easton, MD late 2017 (See title painting and three additional paintings in the section below). I am planning a beautiful, 100% recycled catalog of the show. In order to cover the up-front costs of design and production, I am offering pre-sales of the catalog, as well as a gorgeous assortment of prints, art cards, and rewards that you will not be able to get anywhere else.
ABOUT THE EXHIBITION:
From Uprooted: Heinz's Cabinet, Oil and Egg Tempera on Panel. ©Madeline von Foerster 2015
Uprooted is a series of paintings that tell a story. It's the adventure of a wooden jointed doll, or Gliederpuppe, carved out of wood during the 16th century as an objet d'Art for a Curiosity Cabinet. She inhabits a realm that is full of precious items collected from the natural world: taxidermy, coral, ivory, and the like -- but nothing that is alive. Our Gliederpuppe gradually attains a kind of consciousness; over time she even learns that she is made out of material that was once a living tree. She feels a longing to return to existence in the forest -- to be surrounded by vibrant life rather than dead objects. We join her on this journey of discovery and redemption.
From ""Uprooted:"" La Nature Sauvage, Oil and Egg Tempera on Panel ©Madeline von Foerster 2015
The Curiosity Cabinet, or Wunderkammer -- the setting for much of this series -- is a motif used in many of my paintings. It so perfectly symbolizes humanity's dichotomous impulses towards nature: a laudable curiosity and admiration, combined with a fetishistic, ultimately doomed desire to contain and possess. Ironically, the Curiosity Cabinet is an ever more apt symbol for nature itself in the Anthropocene: fragmented, isolated, and reduced to human possession, for human ends. Appearing in many of the paintings are examples from an entire genus of Hawaiian snail that was ""collected"" into extinction, and other animals who were similarly ""loved"" to annihilation. 
From ""Uprooted:"" Mirabilia, Oil and Egg Tempera on Panel. ©Madeline von Foerster 2015
Almost all of us live our lives surrounded by objects that have histories we never think about -- our wooden furniture may have once been a tree towering in the rainforest, home to innumerable other creatures. Millions of people buy ivory, without comprehending that they are contributing to the extinction of elephants. Like the Gliederpuppe, we suffer from this alienation and separation, even if we cannot identify it. It is a pang no amount of consumption can assuage. In a sense we are also trapped in this cabinet-world full of collected objects, removed from our source. Even if we can never return to a life in the forest, we can affirm the preciousness of life and its living products, ourselves among them -- this is the message of Uprooted.
I'd be honored to have you join me for this adventure!

The ""Painting at Night"" album involves no shipping; it can be easily added to any other reward for an additional €11!
If you are unsure about total costs including shipping, contact me. You can always adjust the final amount under ""Manage Your Pledge.""
STRETCH GOALS:
The budget of this campaign is meant to cover the basic printing costs for a minimal number of catalogs (using high-end 100% recycled paper), the graphic design, the costs for the other rewards, Kickstarter and credit-card fees, and shipping. If we reach those goals, there are additional stretch goals that your pledge would contribute to! If this campaign can reach a total of:
€10,500 (stretch goal of €1,500): Cover flaps… Cover flaps will make the catalog more substantial and elegant! I want these so badly! --UNLOCKED!! Thank You! --
€12,000 (stretch goal of €1,500): Introductory essay by notable person  --UNLOCKED!! Thank You! --
€16,000 (stretch goal of €4,000): Production of a video tour of the entire body of work, telling the ""story"" of Uprooted much as an animated film would. This will be an incredible way to experience the paintings close-up and in detail, for people who may never get to see them in real life. This amount would cover the professional editing and music licensing.
There are so many other costs involved here; even just getting the rest of the paintings photographed will cost me over €1,000. Your contribution ensures that I can focus on painting rather than financing, and you will have my eternal gratitude!"
985,1502850969,"What is A Better Home and Garden?
A Better Home and Garden is an installation-based art exhibition that will be at Bunker Projects in February 2019. The show will highlight interdisciplinary artists: Selena Hurst and Derek Peel and is curated by Emma Vescio. The show aims to create experiential rooms that simulate what we accept as real while highlighting 70s-80s interior design trends.
What is Bunker Projects?
Bunker Projects is an artist-run non-profit residency and experimental gallery that serves as a platform for emerging artists to develop their practice and create new works for an exhibition. By providing an immersive live/work space alongside intimate cultural programming, we foster a spirit of innovative support, connecting artists with Pittsburgh’s active and growing arts community.
Bunker's contemporary art space  values the process of making art and exhibiting work to the public. Bunker specializes in installation and multi-disciplinary work by independent artists.  On first Friday of the month, in this case February, Bunker premieres a new show for Unblurred Gallery Crawl.
 
Who are the artists? 
Hurst simulates the appearance of interior objects and surfaces in photographs, life-sized stickers, and floor-like sculptures. The images printed on adhesive vinyl merely resemble curtains, but they are transformed into functioning objects when positioned on windows. Her work questions the boundaries that divide and define the real and its representation. 
For this exhibition: Selena is working with fabric to create small, sewn objects, working with wood to create a ball-pit like structure that visitors are able to jump into, and is looking to purchase astro-turf to tie into the retro vibe.  
Peel employs common objects and materials in their work to connect us with our fragmented surroundings.  Their sculptural figures and installations imply varying degrees of distress, confusion, imperfection, and are often contradictory.
For this exhibition: Peel is working with carpet, ceiling tiles, LED lights, and small installation works. Their work requires technical skill and time in order to be executed well.
 What will we do with your funding? 
The funding of this project is mainly to cover the remaining costs of these installations. While the work has been conceptualized and the pieces + outlines have already been made, the remaining details need to be paid for. Along with installation aspects, there are marketing and curatorial details that will be placed in the gallery that need to be paid for as well.
With $1000:
$750
Installation Materials include:
Astro-turf (About $325)
Fabric (About $250)
Ceiling Tiles ($40)
LED Lights ($54)
Carpet ($81)
$200
Lumber can be classified as an installation material, but will coincide with other exhibition needs.
$250
Marketing Materials include:
Printing costs (~$100)
Paint (~$60)
Posters (~$50)
Vinyl information stickers for gallery (~20)
Plexiglass (~20)
The Impact
It is crucial to allow artist-run spaces to continue to survive. Bunker Projects continuously supports artists by having the location and space for experimental work, but often times the money to produce these pieces is very expensive. While there are plenty of spaces for installation-based works in Pittsburgh, your contribution will be supporting two emerging artists to create experiential works that are not funded by a major institution. Not only will you be supporting these artists, you will be supporting the art community of Pittsburgh, the curator who wants this exhibition to highlight both Selena and Derek's work, and Bunker Projects. 
While this exhibition is open, there will be events in the space to discuss the works, a potluck or brunch alongside an artist talk, and gallery hours on Sundays so you are able to see the exhibition beyond our opening + closing events.
Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute, that's okay. There are a couple of other easy ways to help:
 Share our Kickstarter: Invite friends who would be interested to contribute via e-mail and social media.
 Follow Bunker Projects: Sign up for Bunker's e-mail list and follow on Instagram and Facebook.
 Follow Selena, Derek, and Emma: All three contributors to this exhibition work hard in Pittsburgh and have many other events/exhibitions. Selena's Instagram, Derek's Instagram, and Emma's Instagram.
 Check out the space: Come visit Bunker Projects during the exhibition or our First Friday event! We also have performance art events, film screenings, potlucks, artist talks, etc. in the space.
If we surpass our goal, we will be able to pay the artists a small stipend for their work and time they spent creating these installations, purchase food/drinks for the opening + artist talk, and the rest of the money will go to Bunker Projects.
We cannot thank you enough for taking the time to look at this project. We hope that you are able to make it to the exhibition!

Our shop not only prints custom screening orders for clients, but we also create retail designs that reflect the toughness, resilience and spirit of the community.
To this end we are celebrating our 14th anniversary by printing this limited edition ""Believe in Flint"" t-shirt. The design shows Flint's iconic Weatherball. It is used to this day to show the community what the upcoming weather will be and is visible from anywhere in the city.
The shirts are 5.5-ounce, 100% cotton and are made in the USA. From the cotton to the fabric manufacturing to the sewing of the finished shirt, the shirts help create and sustain jobs right here in America.

We will use the money raised to improve our Downtown Flint retail storefront and to continue to provide the community with our services.
Flint City T-Shirts is excited about the future of Flint. Our city has been through some difficult times, but we know we will make it if we continue to Believe in Flint!"
987,2116243350," I've been through so much in the past 20 years no one would believe it even when I put it in black-and-white. You may think that this book should belong in fiction because the stories I have to tell sometimes seem greater than life itself, but it's definitely nonfiction. I have doctors,nurses,family friends and others to verify every word. "
988,375123486,"Our Shop
We are a small bike shop in the heart of the Leschi neighborhood of Seattle. For the last three years we’ve had a plethora of questions about when we would be coming out with a kit. We held off because we wanted to make sure they’d be done right, and by right, we mean quality kits, a design that paid homage to the heritage of the sport, and one that was unique without going in a direction people would expect. We have put all those elements together, and we’re pretty excited about it. Our hope is for this to be the start of limited edition kits to offer to the cycling community. Because we are a small shop though, it's tough sometimes to put up the capital to be able to order kits of the quality we want to be represented in the shop. That's why we are looking for your support.
Who are we? 
We are a bike shop whose customers, employees and owner believe in the soul of bikes. As our manager of the shop explained to us when we hired him ""For me a ride is never just a ride and a bike is never 'just a bike'...Cycling is a gateway to freedom, a new view of self and mental quiet...I want to work at a shop that gets that...A shop that is the center of its own community"" - Bob Grunau. 
Our Kits:
Sleeve Detail
The kits themselves are coming from Squadra, a company that has been around since 1996. That’s not a long time–when it comes to heritage brands–but deep in their history is work with Maurizo Castelli. Yes, that Castelli. Squadra was born out of that guidance. While not as ubiquitous in the world of custom kit as Castelli, the quality is on par with the more popular brand.
As for the design: we wanted a look that would pay homage to the to riders of the past. We figured it was best to start with the Champion of Champions: Fausto Coppi. Being the dominant rider of his time, Coppi was also a cultural movement. In post war Italy you were either with the urban Coppi, or you were a Bartali supporter, who’s deep Catholic faith was indicative of a Italy that has falling into the past.
To achieve this end, we asked Heartthrob Racing’s Tim Hubner to design the kit. We sent Tim a picture of this great rider in his classic Bianchi kit and said “Something like this.” Tim more than delivered with a light blue and white jersey that says The Polka Dot Jersey across the front in that beautiful Campagnolo script. On the right hand sleeve is a cartoon of the man himself. Underneath it reads “Coppi Lives, Coppi the Myth” in Italian, a line he gleaned from William Fortheringham’s excellent bio: ""Fallen Angel: The Passion of Fausto Coppi""
For the shorts we went with your basic black, and the letters PDJ along the leg in a cream color, as it was back in the day. The shorts will work with your favorite plain jersey, and the jersey will work with you favorite pair of black shorts. The pairing will look great, but you can mix and match either with your favorite kit. We will have women's specific sizing!
We are also going to do a run of classic cycling caps. 
Cycling Cap
Back Panel of Cap and Bill Underside
If we reach our funding goal and you select a donation of greater than $100, we will contact you afterwards to get your sizing selection. All the orders will be compiled together and will be submitted to Squadra for printing. Turn-around for this is approximately 4-6 weeks after the completion of the project. These will be a limited edition series and once the kits are gone in the shop, the design will be archived away. 
We also have a funding stretch goal. If we reach $4500 in total donations and you have pledged greater than $100, we will throw in a cycling cap with your order. This stretch goal will allow us to carry a good amount of stock in the shop for those not as cool as our awesome backers to get their hands on some amazing kits. "
989,1669069307,"The Story
At GenCon a few years ago, I was looking around the convention center and wondering why events like this weren’t more common at the local level. There were 80,000 people traveling in from across the world just to attend this gaming event. This inspired me to create a plan for a permanent location where gamers could come and do what they love most. 
Five years ago, I opened East Coast Gaming (ECG).  We quickly grew to where we are today and have even had the need to move to a bigger location to support our growing customer base.  As a result of having a big open play space, we stumbled into the hosting video game tournaments that have become a weekly staple on Mondays.  In addition, we now provide a venue for at least 2 groups who have large monthly events that fill the place. 
Over the past several years, ""board game cafés"" have become more common, but we will be the first in the Research Triangle area. The Research Triangle is full of active gamers and recently ranked in the top 20 of best gaming cities. Not only has there been an increase in individuals gaming, but we have also seen a number of corporations express interest in  engaging with their employees through gaming.
With the expansion of the bar and café, we have decided it’s time to re-brand East Coast Gaming to GAMERS: Geekery and Tavern.  We will become a unique blend of board game café and event space designed to serve the gaming community. The venue will have a small but quality food menu...great drinks – coffee, local sodas, beer and wine...and be designed to host groups of all sizes.
GAMERS will use proceeds from this Kickstarter to help fund the development of our unique board game café project, which we expect to be complete in early July 2019. 
The Venue
Gamers: Geekery and Tavern will be located at 107 Edinburgh S., Suite 213 in Cary NC. It is just over 4,200 square feet and is located on the second floor of the newly renovated MacGregor Village.
https://www.google.com/maps/place/Macgregor+Village/@35.7542941,-78.8198184,12z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89ac8d2b7abd05f5:0x5ea48cdfa466ac24!8m2!3d35.7367485!4d-78.7986623
Gamers floor plan has been designed to allow for a wide assortment of activities. There is a large room set up as a board game café area where patrons can play games on over-sized tables. Inside that area is a social game section composed of couches and chairs where large social games (such as Werewolf) can be played. There is an E-sports area with couches and chairs where patrons can stream Twitch TV across multiple televisions and/or play their favorite console games. There is a tournament area where card and video game tournaments will be held. Lastly, there is a private Game Lair which can be booked for group activities (such as D&D). 
Floor diagram
In the center of the room is a large area where the kitchen and bar are located. Patrons will be able to order food/snacks and drinks (beer, wine, mead, coffee, sodas, etc.) while they are playing. 
How will it work
Similar to other board game cafés, there will be a $5 venue fee (or $10 per family) and this will allow you access to the entire board game library for the day. The board game library will start with over 200 different games to choose from. There will be a wide spectrum of choices, staples like Monopoly and Yahtzee, European style games like Settlers of Catan and Ticket to Ride, social games like Apples to Apples and CodeNames. We will be regularly adding games to the library so it can grow and stay up to date. If you are coming for a specific event that has an entry fee (say Friday Night Magic or Smash Brothers tournament) your venue fee will be included as part of the event entry fee.
We will also offer both monthly and annual subscriptions for either an individual for a family. Individual memberships will be priced at $15 per month or $120 annually; family memberships will be priced at $25 per month or $240 annually. Membership will include unlimited access to the game library, discounted pricing on events, and a free appetizer on your birthday every year.

991,1012164396,"Thank you for considering supporting Departed Soles Brewing Company, opening up soon in Jersey City, New Jersey!
My name is Brian and I'm the owner of Departed Soles Brewing Company (www.departedsoles.com), as well as the brewer, tour guide, bartender, janitor, and any other title you could think of.  I greatly appreciate you taking a minute or two to check out the brewery's Kickstarter and for any consideration you give towards helping me out.
What is Departed Soles Brewing Company?
DSBC is Jersey City's FIRST Craft Brewery and only the second functioning commercial brewery and tasting room in Hudson County.  We are going to be the first brewery in the State of New Jersey, and really anywhere nearby, that is specializing in making Gluten Free craft beer!  DSBC will be making non-gluten-free beer as well, but more on that later!!
Panoramic view of the brewery equipment
Who is Departed Soles Brewing Company?
Departed Soles is a one man operation currently!  Well, one man and one four legged friend. My name is Brian, and the Australian Shepherd by my side is Bogan. Don't get me wrong though, we hope to expand and employ locals quickly...
Brewing became a passion of mine after spending time working at a dive bar in Boston, and then living where Craft Beer seemed impossible to find.   In 2009, it became a ""give a man a fish, or teach a man to fish"" scenario and thanks to my older brother, I was home brewing that Christmas.
Several years later I was accepted in to the American Brewers Guild Brewing School's Intensive Brewing Science and Engineering program, with a focus on Breweries in Planning, and graduated in December of 2012. 
We've been looking for property to start our brewery ever since then and are glad that that chapter of the book is almost done being written! 
You can keep track of the progress we make on Facebook!
My Mom, my Cousin, Bogan, and I after a long day's work!
You said ""we"" there, why?
You will often catch me saying ""we"" when talking about the brewery. It is something that I wouldn't eliminate from my vocabulary or train of thought even if I could.
Departed Soles was originally a basement-born plan between my best friend and I to start our own brew pub.  He was a local teacher who also worked at a nearby restaurant and I was regularly brewing beer. In fact, he was also Gluten Intolerant and that was the reason I was experimenting with gluten free recipes.  Nobody should have to drink a vodka cranberry during a football game!
He often said that I would never leave my family business to chase our mutual dream, and he was probably right.
Unfortunately, in October of 2010, he was commuting between his two jobs and involved in a car accident.  He passed away later that evening with his family by his side.
So, while it is just one half of the original duo pushing forward with the dream, I know I am not doing it alone. I know that he is ""up there,"" inspiring me and guiding me, getting me through the bad days and celebrating with me on the good ones. There isn't a day that goes by that I don't miss him.  He pushed me to be a better person, and without him, I would never have ventured down this path and been as good as a brewer, or person, as I am.
Departed Soles Brewing Company is dedicated to his memory.
I would be remiss, however, if I didn't add here that my family is a HUGE part of DSBC. I would also not be the person I am without my parents, and this brewery would not be what it is without them.  The love and support, as well as hard work, got me here, and my brothers' work cannot be taken for granted. Thank you all!
Isn't the name a little depressing?
Despite what you may gather from the above story, ""Departed Soles"" is not meant to be morbid, or about death at all!  It is ""Soles,"" not ""Souls,"" after all.
Departed Soles is about the people that do something a little different, defy the odds, go against expectations, chase their own dreams, etc. Departed Soles are not the people that walk in line, but get out and march to the beat of their own drum.
Departed Soles beer is about going against the grain!
Our logo captures a lot of what New Jersey is, as well as the Urban, City vibe we are embracing!
Is the beer actually good?
During my final week at the American Brewers Guild Brewing School we hosted a bottle share at the house I was staying in.  Amongst the many good beers from around the world that were available, I presented my teacher with GoodbiPA, the flagship gluten free offering of Departed Soles. He liked it so much that he brought it to his wife and presented it to her. She took a sip and said ""Mmm that's good, what is it?"" His response was ""Would you believe that's Gluten Free?""
A few weeks later, the same beer took home a BEST IN SHOW award at New York City's Homebrew Alley, winning its category against glutenous beers along the way.  There were approximately 777 entries in this contest, with the category it won being the most entered amongst all BJCP categories.
(The events of that night before finding out I won the awards are a great story... ask when you visit the brewery!)
Since that time, my brewing has been nearly 100% dedicated to perfecting Gluten Free Recipes.  We're not just making a gluten free beer to appease a particular crowd - we are making a Gluten Free beer that folks with and without the intolerance will enjoy.  We don't want you to have to buy a 6 pack for a friend... we want you to be able to buy a case for everyone!
DSBC will launch with two beers in distribution: GoodbiPA, our flagship Gluten Free IPA that rings in around 6% ABV, as well as A Dark Night, our Black IPA that is also made of 100% Gluten Free ingredients.
Our tasting room, however, we will feature a rotating selection of beer that is both Gluten Free and Non-Gluten Free.  Our initial selection will include a Nut Brown Ale, a Red Ale, and more.  These beers will be scaled up to the full system once our keg fleet can satisfy the demand.  The Tasting Room will also feature collaborations with local brewers and breweries!
***We are currently going through the certification process to call the beer ""Gluten Free"" officially, but they are and will be made with 100% gluten free ingredients regardless***

Why did you wait so close to opening to launch a Kickstarter?
I launch this campaign knowing that it may look a little odd.  There is the chance, after all, that the brewery is open before it ends (if we keep our fingers crossed, keep working our tails off, and pray very hard).  There are three reasons for this:
1) Firstly, I did not want to promise anything that I could not deliver. This thing will happen right here in the Powerhouse Arts District of Downtown Jersey City!
2) Secondly, the craft brewing community is extremely close knit.  The New Jersey Craft Brewing scene has been fortunate to see a great amount of growth in recent years and, in light of that, a lot of Kickstarter campaigns.  Out of respect for the people running those fundraisers, and the awesome people supporting them, I did not want to launch a campaign while another NJ brewery was fundraising.
3) Finally, health.  During the build out process I was seriously injured and essentially out of commission for two months.  Not only did this cause some serious delays, but it caused some unforeseen expenses both personally and for the brewery.  I could not present myself to you during that time, in the condition I was in, and ask for support while I could not be physically working.
See, we even have a Google Places Page. We're too legit to quit now!
What will the money be used for?
The million dollar question!  Or 15,000? We could use more...
As mentioned above, there were some costs during our build out phase that were unforeseen that pushed the brewery beyond the start up budget and initial investment. While many of those bills have been paid, or terms struck, there are still bills forthcoming that need to be addressed, and there are still expenses before getting the beer to you.  These funds will not only go to those.
More particularly, these funds will be used on:
Gluten Free Certification - This process costs several thousands of dollars and involves site visits, product testing, and special processing procedures.
A FORK LIFT! 
Finishing our build out - Duct work, audio presentations, and installing a fantastic draft system.
Virtual Tour - So you know as much as we do, if not more!
Expanding our keg fleet - We currently have enough kegs to distribute approximately 20-30 bars. We would like to double that.
A Keg Washer/Racker - In order to serve you the best beer, whether it is in our tasting room or out around the Tri-State Area, we need to get it to you in the best manner & condition possible. This means quality equipment, and in this case, ensuring that the way it is getting to you is clean, sanitized, and properly filled. The best way to ensure that is to do it in 1 step, not multiple.
Permits - Our state requires a permit for everything, from brewing, to selling, to the vehicle transporting the product. These annual fees are due at the beginning of the summer.

THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION!  PLEASE FEEL FREE TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE!
Sincerely,
Brian & Bogan

994,925640234,"Many of you - like myself – might have fond memories of the Manchester Storm ice hockey club from the late 90’s to the early 00’s.
Granted I was only 8 or 9 at the time but I remember some fantastic stuff. Many a heart was broken when it was announced in 2002 that the club would be folding due to financial difficulties.
It’s come to my attention that this year (2015) would mark the 20th anniversary of the once great hockey club. With this in mind I wanted to create a little something to commemorate it.
I’m proposing a limited run of shirts under the banner of ‘Sons of the Storm’ for those of us who still hold a candle for them in our hearts.
Who's with me?!"
995,404937234,"UPDATE #4: I'm typing this on 10/18. Sometime in the last few days, we realized we were over 200% funded. Wow. Thanks. We really don't know how to say thank you enough times. After I made the project live I had a short panic attack after worrying that maybe $800 was ""too much."" What if we only got $400 or $600 and so had nothing and had to fund Volume 2 out of pocket. And now we've doubled the original Goal. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Since typing that doesn't seem to do our feelings justice, Chris ""Terry"" Durston even made a special video for our backers. GO watch it.
UPDATE #3: On 10/13, we crossed $1400, all our contributors are being paid $20, twice as much as our first stretch goal (and, mathematically speaking, infinitely more than the $0 they signed up for!). We currently have no more stretch goals. Any funds left over after creating and distributing Volume 2 will be rolled into the Skullgate coffers and used for promotions or saved for future volumes.
UPDATE #2: As of 9/29, we've reached our first stretch goal, so all our contributors will be paid! Our next goal is $1400. We've also added a number of digital add-ons you can add to your current pledge.
UPDATE #1: Now that we've exceeded what we need to produce the book, we would LOVE to be able to pay our contributors for their stories! So that's our stretch goals: not a premium foil cover or a hardcover edition, but paying artists for their work.
 STRETCH GOAL #1 -  $1100. All contributors are paid a flat rate of $10
 STRETCH GOAL #2 - $1400. All contributors are paid a flat rate of $20
  That's it. Simple, fair, and (I hope) appealing to backers like you who generously support independent authors. 
(Placeholder-actual cover art and title still undecided)
Volume 2 of Tales from the Year Between is an anthology of weird science-fiction that brings writers from around the world to create an original, shared world and then write stories set in that shared universe. We have just finished recruiting a new array of 24, talented collaborators. Soon we’ll start building our world and spinning tales, and in February we will have a fabulous collection of thrilling sci-fi to share with the world--with your help!
 Tales From the Year Between 
Part literary magazine, part writing club, and all creativity, Tales From the Year Between is the best-selling speculative fiction anthology with a unique premise. Twice a year it gathers a disparate group of authors from all across the globe to collaborate in shared world-building and creative writing. Using a modified version of Avery Alder’s fabulous game The Quiet Year as a massive writing prompt, each volume of The Year Between begins with nothing more than a simple premise (“a desert fantasy world, like D&D’s Dark Sun”). Contributors participate in a week-long “game” to create a shared canon of people, places, events, and themes. From this chaotic melange of ideas, each participant then creates their own stories, poems, letters, and even recipes, all set in the world they created together.
Volume 1 generated the world of Achten Tan, a strange, post-apocalyptic fantasy world inspired by old pulp fantasy, TSR’s Darksun’s, and the weird-fiction of China Mieville, MT Anderson. The resulting book, Achten Tan: Land of Dust and Bone. debuted as a “Hot New Release” on Amazon and garnered glowing reviews.
But the idea of Tales from the Year Between is to keep moving on to new worlds. So now we’re gearing up to do it all over again. New collaborators, new world-building, new stories, new book. It’s going to be completely unlike the last volume, which is what makes it so exciting!
Volume 2 - Untitled Space Adventure!
We can’t tell you much about Volume 2 because the nature of this project means it hasn’t been made yet. Our contributors come to us with writing skills and a willingness to create together, but the world is a blank slate. Together, we will begin with the sketch of a premise. For this book, we begin with a crew of space marines who have stolen a sentient alien ship and now find themselves stranded at the far side of the galaxy. That’s it. All the details--who they are, what the ship is like, what planets they discover and what adventures they have--is all unknown until we play The Game.
Buy a copy yourself! It's a fantastic game.
The Game is a highly modified version of Avery Alder’s The Quiet Year. Over the course of a week, the 24 contributors to this book will take turns suggesting locations and resources, adding details to the characters, and responding to random prompts drawn from a deck of cards. By the time everyone has taken their turn, we will have an outline of a year in the life of our crew: their names and ranks and relationships, the drama and tragedies that have befallen them. It will be a big, messy, shared cannon.
And then each writer will set out to tell a story in that world. We encourage our writers to push boundaries and genres. Last time we got flash-fiction and journal entries, letters and traditional stories, even recipes. Who knows what we’ll get this time? We don’t, which makes us giddy with excitement.
Art and Interior
We will be commissioning original art for the cover. We don’t know what the subject will be yet, but we will be using the same artist as Volume 1 for a wrap-around illustration. The four sections of the book will have full-page spreads of high-quality stock art. Aaron Hockett, who provided the maps for Achten Tan, will be doing maps for this book as well. 
The final maps REALLY makes Volume 1 stand out!
In addition, he’s also doing a 12-page graphic-prologue. The manuscript will be compiled using Vellum, a software program that creates a slick and professionally formatted interior layout.
A sneak-peak at the thumbnails for the graphic prologue by Aaron Hockett
Rewards
When completed, the book will be available in all digital formats (Kindle, Nook, ePub, PDF) as well as in print via Amazon or wherever books are sold.
 If you back at a level for a digital book reward, when the campaign ends you will be able to select the digital format of your choice.
Digital edition available on every device!
If you back and receive a regular paperback, the book will be shipped to you directly from Amazon using their KDP print-on-demand service.
The print books are sweet! You want one!
If you back at a level to receive a signed book, it will first be shipped to Editor-In-Chief Chris Van Dyke. The books will be signed, numbered, and noted that they are from the 2020 Kickstarter Campaign.
Why Kickstarter?
We are a new, independent publishing collective, and even when produced using print-on-demand are set costs that need to be paid upfront to getting a book up and running. If you support this campaign, you are helping by getting us the funds when we need them most -- before we go to print!
Base costs:
Custom cover art -- $230+
Purchase ISBNs -- $60
Registration through IngramSpark Distribution - $50
Stock Art for website and Internal - $50
Webhosting ($5/month, ongoing)
Printing costs for each physical copy (varies based on number of backers)
  Also, by purchasing your copy of Volume 2 through this campaign, you are buying directly from us, not through the Amazon, B&N, or some other third party. This means more of your money goes directly to Skullgate Media and will help us make more Volumes going forward!
Timeline
As of October 1st, we have finished recruiting the contributors to Volume 2! In the third week of October, we will be playing The Quiet Year to establish the world. Writers will be working on their submissions all through November and into the start of December, then we will move into layout and copyediting. Our goal is to have the book finalized for prepublication on February 1st and available for traditional purchase on February 15th.
Digital copies of the book will begin shipping to backers via email on February 2nd. Print copies will be ordered on February 15th. Depending on shipping (twice, if you order a signed copy) paperbacks should arrive by the end of February."

Hip Expressions is a growing group of dancers, yogis, and supporters - we moved into our new expanded space with only ONE bathroom and no walls.  Since then, we’ve done much of the construction ourselves but now we need YOUR help so we can finish the construction of our Studio.  Then, we can get out of line, and back to what we like best - DANCING!
**We have ADDITIONAL costs now too, our home theater just shut down and we are working on transforming our Studio space into a Performance Art Space!  We've been doing our monthly shows for over 10 years now, and we're excited to host them at our OWN studio, but we need lights, curtains, backdrop, and more... and definitely more than one bathroom as our attendance is around 100 people a show!**
Our mission is to provide a path of creativity, health, and self-development through dance and movement arts, in a safe and nurturing environment, for a community of all ages, shapes, and sizes.  
We offer inspiration, motivation, and transformation, at our Studio/Community Center and beyond.  We promise a creative experience for every spirit; the exploration of well-being, self-expression, and personal fulfillment through our classes, performances, and events.
Be Strong, Be Sexy, Belly Dance!
Dance & Movement for Every Body
Hi, I’m Johanna Xenobia. I moved to Florida in 2000.  My resolve was to add to the positive energy of the universe by sharing what inspired me - belly dance!  I met belly dance artist Karen Sun Ray and immediately we realized we shared the same mission - to not only inspire people, but to create a community of dance.  In 2004, we founded Hip Expressions, a collective of artists, teachers, and live music and dance performance projects.  
We had a minor setback when I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2007, and the belly dance community nationwide pulled together to help me out by raising over $25,000 to help pay for my surgeries and chemotherapy treatments.  I was shocked at the power of community!  I was so honored and grateful - I knew that I would spend the rest of my life nurturing our art form and the community surrounding it.  To evolve our art form, and inspire others to collaborate in the process!
Less than a year out of my last treatment, we got to work, and opened our first small studio, 680 square feet, with six teachers.  We wanted to start small, but immediately knew we had to go bigger!  Within three years, we exploded out of that space into our current 3600 square foot space (more than tripling our square footage!).  Our teaching staff of sixteen now encompasses a plethora of art forms that support health and wellness - not just belly dance, but also Nia, Yoga, Polynesian, Samba, Burlesque, Jazz, Hoop, and more!
We are lucky, the new space had beautiful hard wood floors and mirrors already installed, saving us a bunch of setup, but there was lots of work to be done.  It was larger than we anticipated, but everything fell into place for it to work and so we took the leap.  Now our mission was to build within the space - it was one big room with one bathroom - and it was up to us to do the construction ourselves.  We’ve successfully put up a few walls, creating two spaces and have plans for a third room, along with a lobby, boutique area, and a treatment room for massage.
Then, construction slowed… by law, we need a 2nd bathroom - a great idea for the number of people we have come through here on a daily basis!  Not only do we have more classes, but are also hosting our monthly showcases (running for over 11 years!), studio events, overnights and more.  Now the lines are even longer and we are asking for your help - we can’t continue to grow without a bathroom - and we can’t wait in line any longer!
Just last week, our regular performance venue/dinner theater closed!  Now we need a place to host our Studio Showcases, we've been running them monthly for eleven years and it's not time to stop now!  No problem - we will convert our current large studio space (about 1400 square feet) into a 100 seat theater.  Now, we definitely need two bathrooms to host these shows!
We embrace many genres of dance & performance art.
Main Goal: New Bathroom
This bathroom will also have a shower, and we’ll install a water fountain too.  Selling bottled water at $1/bottle towards our bathroom is slow going, and the girls are patient but nature calls...
($5700)
Stretch Goal #1: Air Conditioning
We need to run ducts to the new rooms - and buy a new unit for the small room.  It gets hot.  Especially during the Florida summers, where our classes get full (‘cause it’s too hot to do anything outside), and then it’s too hot to do anything inside too.  Don’t let us turn into a hot yoga studio, p-p-p-please!
($7700)
Stretch Goal #2: Another Wall
So the Drum Class does not disturb the Yoga Class.  Yogis vs Percussion, it could get ugly. Enough said.
($9200)
Stretch Goal #3: Lights
Our fixtures are out of date, and we are running on pretty IKEA lights which are great but we’re squinting.  It’s bad for our eyes.
($11200)
Stretch Goal #4: Theatre Conversion
Lights, backdrop, curtains, sound system, etc!  
($13700)
Extras…
There’s always something else!  Fixing the hole in the floor in the first bathroom, a new mini-fridge so we can store food and drinks for dancers, yoga blocks, yoga straps, trim, caulk, more mirrors for the walls, you name it, triple the price you think it’s gonna cost and you’re close!
PLUS we want to start offering on-line classes - this means rigging up the Studio for video!  Video equipment isn't cheap...  But just think, then you can experience all the joy of Hip Expressions - right in the comfort of your own home!
Testimonial:
This is a WONDERFUL studio!!! I have danced all over the country, and really, it is rare that you find a place this dedicated to creating a true environment of expression, dance, family, and fostering the artistic growth of its students. Belly dance is the studio's focus, but lots of other dances find a home here as well - Nia, bollywood, odissi, yoga, burlesque, polynesian, jazz... Also - talk about bringing in amazing performers for amazing workshops - I'm in heaven!!!! THANK YOU!!!!! Oh, and if you want to book some amazing performers for an event? THIS is who you should be talking to!

997,1012581492,"When I stumbled upon my roommate building an AR-15 rifle in the garage, it led to an exploration of the role that guns play in our culture, the effect this tool has on a new friendship, and the treacherous and confusing nature of our mediated realities. 
I never planned on making a movie about guns; they were never on my mind — until suddenly it seemed they were all around me. I didn't know how to feel about this sudden proximity to firearms in my life, but I knew I wanted to understand more about them, both as a tool and as a symbol.
I believe very passionately in the power and potential of micro-budget cinema. Everything I have done in my adult life has been to serve the idea that powerful movies can be made within extremely small means by properly structuring and utilizing life's most precious resource: our time.
Making this film has been intense already, and we haven't even shot it yet! The polarizing nature of firearm ownership has proven to be an exceptionally treacherous battleground of ideologies and temperaments. We do not shy away from this complexity, and in many ways it is precisely the goal of this film: to stimulate more conversation around this subject in a way politics cannot do. It’s no secret that this country was founded at the barrel of a gun — now we are all living in that shadow...
Shadow of a Gun is the story of two neighbors who form an unlikely friendship:
Tom is a working class intellectual stoner and gun enthusiast. He works a day job and lets off steam after work by building guns in his garage. His workbench is his sanctuary, his escape from the problems of the world and his solitary meditation.
Jason lives alone in one of his parents' properties and spends his days trying to cure boredom, often by exploring the lives of others through media and pushing social boundaries with divisive behavior.
When Jason crashes his drone into a neighboring yard, he meets Tom. Jason shows interest in Tom's life, so Tom shows him his workshop. Tom's passion for building guns quickly becomes contagious, and Jason decides he wants to build his own...
Shadow of a Gun traces the beginning of this new friendship; a means through which they explore the foibles of routine, isolation, and their place in the world.
It's going to be an intense experimental journey to the heart of a complex issue with a group of wonderful collaborators and some of my closest friends. We're shooting the movie throughout the summer and editing as we go...
  Micah Van Hove (director/producer)
Micah is a writer/director and film journalist who has been exploring the possibilities in micro-budget cinema since 2009. His first feature film Menthol premiered at Santa Barbara, Sofia International, and Brooklyn film festivals. His work as a music video director has premiered on Vice, NPR, Stereogum and more. As a regular writer for No Film School since 2013, Micah has sought out to stimulate thoughtful discourse and elevate films that reflect a commitment to personal and courageous work.
Micah is fascinated with the foibles of youth, alienation, and expectation.
Joe Marine (director of photography)
After studying film and photography at Fitchburg State in Massachusetts, Joe interned at Ridley Scott's Commercial and Music Video production company in Los Angeles, and then went freelance full-time in 2011.
He was one of the first writers hired at the filmmaking website No Film School in February 2012, and became its first Managing Editor the same year. Joe has written and directed a number of his own short films, and is in post-production on his first narrative feature Happy Birthday, Gerald Norton.
Jeffrey Reeser (editor)
Jeffrey Reeser is a screenwriter and freelance editor living in Los Angeles and has written several novel adaptations. His ability to approach subjects with equal parts sensitivity and objectivity lends a sober, thoughtful eye to all of the images he dreams up and assembles. Not afraid to speak his mind, Jeffrey enables and facilitates constructive creative friction — a key ingredient for all members of a production to operate at their best. After studying Dramatic Arts and Film at the University of Southern California, Jeffrey edited the Gusmano Cesaretti film Take None Give None, a feature documentary about the South Central motorcycle club The Chosen Few.
Morgan Greenwood (composer)
Morgan's soundscapes are both chaotically organic and eerily mechanical, and often sound like the birth of an organism on a conveyor belt. From his spellbinding work in Azeda Booth, to his role as ½ of the LA-based group Baths, Morgan's work captures the majesty of a human spirit that refuses to be confined to automated life. Morgan's music is a perfect match to support the story of a newfound mechanical fascination.
Kazdyn Nicholson (assistant editor)
Kazdyn provides an irreplaceably steady and supportive energy in the editing room. After jumping head-first into editing Micah's first feature Menthol, Kazdyn came out the other side with an impeccable understanding of how to support a director's vision. Shadow of a Gun will be edited on an ongoing basis over the summer, and Kazdyn's expertise and presence will be key to keeping our timelines organized and functional.
Gage Siuniak (drone operator)
  Dominic Pino (Tom)
A first time actor and all-around thoughtful human being, Dominic is part of a rare generation of new actors who aren't actors at all — but people willing to put their personal predicaments in front of a lens. A purveyor of truth and a pretty damn good Chess player, Dominic's philosophy towards life and guns lends a crucial edge and reality to the experiential nature of this film.
Jake King (Jason)
With a background in theater and music from the University of Oregon, Jake lends his curiosities to storytelling — in whatever form they may take. He made his break into film acting with Micah Van Hove's Menthol (2014). Beneath his accessible exterior is a dynamic trojan horse for subversive behavior, perfect for delivering performances rife with ambiguity. Jake is a tireless foot-soldier in the excavation of the problematic reality around us.
  We've organized an awesome group of supporting actors to help tell this Southern California story.

Where does your money go?
We believe in keeping production sizes small, mobile, and cost efficient. The modest budget for this film will cover the bare necessities as we all work through the trenches of the story from June through August 2016.
Camera — We're shooting on ARRI Alexa, which is a relatively heavy camera for the often guerrilla situations that we'll be shooting in. A camera assistant would go a long way towards stabilizing and saving time in these situations.
Sound — We need to be able to hire the right production sound professional to get the cleanest audio when shooting in less than ideal (often guerrilla) situations.
Time — Our two leads are played by non-actors, so we have to pull them out of work in order to be able to shoot consecutively. This might derail their lives, but hopefully we can help repair some of the damage.
Locations — We are shooting in Ventura County in Southern California and there are many locations that fit into the world of this film. For scenes in which the main characters are wielding firearms, proper location management is a must-have safety precaution.
Crew — This film is as minimal as it gets, but we will need additional crew for various stages of the production. This includes Assistant Directors, Location Managers, a Grip/Gaffer, and a Boom Operator.
Props — Putting safety first, we will need exact replicas of the real weapons used in the film for many of the scenes.
Day Play Casting — To fill out the world of this film, we are bringing in a lot of great actors and non-actors to act as the backdrop to the main story.

EXHIBIT A: Game Set Up Table View
Story:
After chasing her Great Aunt’s naughty parrot into a grandfather clock, Alice finds herself in Wonderland, once again, for her third adventure. 
A spree of mismatched killings are plaguing Wonderland and Mrs. Minus and her Civil Serpents are investigating these Jigsaw Murders of which Alice is a prime suspect...

In this cooperative dice placement game, players take on the role of Alice. With the assistance of Celia, her automated twin sister, plus other colorful characters, players work together to collect clues to clear everyone’s names.
Automated Alice is based on the novel of the same name by award-winning author Jeff Noon.

Feel the rush of racing against the clock! How well will you spend the little time you have?
Player interaction! Will your group agree on the best placement of dice, or will there be any objections? 
Press your luck! Will you keep what you’ve rolled, or try for a more difficult match?
Experience the excitement and relief when defeating those sneaky serpents!
Enlist help from colorful Wonderland characters, each with their own unique special abilities.
There are four different types of Clue Cards:
EXACT NUMBER: Die must be the exact number and color shown (or wild) to match each die space.
EXACT NUMBER OR HIGHER: Die must be the exact number, or higher, and color shown (or wild) to match each die space.
ODD OR EVEN NUMBER: Die can be any odd number (1/3/5) of the exact color (or wild) to match each odd die space, and any even number (2/4/6) of the exact color (or wild) to match each even die space.
SUM: The total dice face value placed on the card must be equal to or greater than the number listed. The exact color (or wild) must be matched for each die space.
Some Clue Cards have special abilities. After collecting these cards, their special abilities can be used once, at any point during the game, and then discarded.
 There are six different unique Case Files: 
Each of the six Case Files represent a different character with their own unique special ability which you may use each time you visit their file. You may use multiple special abilities if you visit multiple Case Files on your turn.
There are five colored dice in the game:
RED, YELLOW AND BLUE: Must be matched to their color and face value.
PURPLE: Considered “wild” and can be used to match its face value for any color.
GREEN: Represents Mrs. Minus’ league of Civil Serpents. Green dice block your progress but must always be placed first. 
EXHIBIT B: Case File showing dice placement matches
 There are three areas on the Clock Tracker: 
 Clock Face – Keeps track of the game rounds.
   Dice Hold – Any unused dice at the end of a player’s turn are placed, here.
   Civil Serpent Threat Tracker – Any unplaced Civil Serpent dice are placed, here. Once all six spaces are filled, the game is lost.
  EXHIBIT C: Civil Serpent Threat Tracker getting higher!
“I really like the look of this one. It’s so bright. So colorful. It looks like a light, cooperative game – which there are very few of  those. They are usually these big grandiose things going on. I like the  dice chucking part of it. I like the graphic design. I like that it’s an  Alice in Wonderland that’s not super dark…”
“I really enjoy dice chuckers and cooperative games, and this one check both of those boxes...""
""...A number of my games went to the final round, even the final couple of rolls, to decide whether I've won or lost the game.""
""There's also a good amount of strategy...""
""Choosing when you use your Clue Cards to trigger their ability is an  important part of the game as you definitely want to make sure you have them when you need them towards the end of the game, and not spending them too quickly.”
 “Automated Alice is fun mixture of luck of the roll and strategically using the options open to you. It’s bright and colorful, has a really fun table presence with all the case files and clue cards, and its rules are easy to learn and teach making it a great casual dice game with enough depth to keep everyone engaged.
The range of abilities is where the challenge of the game really comes through. Figuring out the best way to move from case file to case file, using their abilities while also choosing locations where you have the best chance of placing your dice is where the strategy of the games lies, and where players will be discussing optimal moves.
Additionally, there is a nice sense of escalation built into the gameplay. As more and more clue cards come off the boards, it becomes more and more difficult to place dice, ensuring that more dice go to the Hold and Civil Serpents become more dangerous. You are also more often faced with press-your-luck choices, balancing risky rolls against having to send dice to the Hold at the end of your turn.”

“Players are given plenty of choices, so they never feel like the dice are playing the game and not them. If you enjoy dice games, definitely check it out...”

999,1093890184,"I started Shady Oak Barrel House in 2013 to dedicate my life and passion for wild and sour barrel aged beers. This is the next step in achieving something truly wild and with a true Sonoma County terroir.
Traditionally, brewers used something called a ""coolship"" to both cool down the unfermented beer (wort) after the boil, and also inoculate the liquid with the local wild yeast and bacteria. The beer then gets transferred to oak barrels to undergo a long aging process, and is finally blended to the brewer's taste. Sonoma County, with all of its unique agricultural areas, is a prime region to make spontaneous beers, and to capture the true depth of the region. And to capture this I'm making a mobile coolship.
I'm partnering with another local brewery, Barrel Brothers Brewing Company, out of Windsor, CA for the build. We have already designed and made the preliminary plans for an all stainless steel coolship, which will then be mounted on a trailer. The basic plan is to brew, then drive out to different locations in the area and let it get inoculated at the location.
Stainless steel construction and fabricating is not an easy or cheap process, and the coolship will include sanitary stainless steel welds and fittings, as well as a lid to use during transportation. Mounting this onto a trailer is also a complicated process, for it has to be able to accommodate the weight of the steel, as well as the liquid, and it must be mounted in a way that is safe to drive around with near boiling temperature liquids sloshing around until I get on location.
The funding received will go towards the parts and labor of creating the coolship trailer. If successful, I will be able to bring a truly sour and wild, agricultural beer to the community. "
