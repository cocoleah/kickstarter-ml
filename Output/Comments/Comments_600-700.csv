This is everything i've been searching for during many years when i was struggling to find results or stats about my team.
Happy to be one of the first seeders and can't wait for it to be launched !!",12

Brandon Huang for finding a great home for Akali,
Sun Hao Kang for loving Wonder Woman,
Klinton Kovar for adopting Aizawa,
James Chua for his epic love of Re: Zero,
Dark Memoria for bringing home Makima, and last but not least,
Jason Li and his support for Power!!!
Thank you to all of you for showing my original art some love ‚ô•
To everyone who has backed this project thus far - one of the first things I do each morning is to mentally run through my to-do list. And more often than not, one of these items would be some sort of a practice/experiment to improve upon my existing drawings. I've been doing this for the past few years already. It's really very challenging but seeing how you all are appreciating my artwork really helps motivate me a lot to keep at it ^^ Thank you everyone!!

More Dante stickers? YOU GOT IT! -- That little bastard loves the attention!
The book is 8.5 x 11 horizontal and is 72 pages (including covers) -- so I guess that makes it 68 inside!
The real question is now, can we use those last 8-9 days to reach $4500 and get everyone hardcover books?

You beat me by about 2 days! I am going to make an official update very shortly that the reprinted books have arrived. They actually arrived about a week and a half ago, a couple days before I had a scheduled trip to visit family for health reasons. I didn‚Äôt want to do a post at that point and tell people they‚Äôd still have to wait until I got back from my family visit for fulfillment. I figured I‚Äôd just do the announcement (and start fulfillment) as soon as I got back, which is tomorrow. So basically, I‚Äôll be home tomorrow, the books are already there, and the first batches will start shipping next week!

Ack! you beat me to it! I was planning to do an update this week or next. I am just about done coloring chapter 3 of the book (out of 5). I've been trying to hit the convention circuit pretty hard this season to drum up interest in the series, especially as I ramp up to Vol 3. But all the travel has definitely taken a toll on the production schedule. On the plus side, except for one last show in Nov, I am done with conventions for the year. so I want to get through coloring the remaining pages quickly and get the book off to the printer! I'll do a proper update shortly, along with some additional pages, so you can all see how it's coming along!

Hey Robert,
I have a fantastic 18x24"" poster designed that I'll be sharing shortly. It is horizontal, but it's a fan favorite image that I think everyone will love. Trying to keep options limited to buy in bulk, keep distribution easier, and maximize the charitable donations.
Stay tuned for an update on timeline! STILL in talks with publishers (this is a slow moving process and I hate keeping everyone in the dark), but should have news soon.

Jeremy: After many starts and stops, after a few coders, more than a few shirt vendors, literally everything is in production right now. Latest, hopefully final, coder started coding this week. New short vendor has files, but is bogged down right now. Hope he'll get them knocked out soon.
Jeremy Pawelek

Did this project ever launch?
Jody CollinsCreator
over 6 years ago
The short answer: no, it's not dead.
This project has been a lot more cumbersome than I originally planned. I actually mapped out everything before I hit ""go"" here on Kickstarter. Almost immediately, a lot of stuff fell apart. Over this past year it feels like for every step forward I've taken, I've ended up two steps back.
The original plan was to have different writers populate the site with content, while I acted more as an Editor. That went out the window, slowly, over the past year. I reassessed, realized I needed to handle all of the content. Which is a large task, vying for new content every work-day. About a month and a half ago I started corralling content. Wanted to get at least two months of content banked before launching. Trying to stay current and evergreen has been tough.
The bigger issue is I lost my mojo for this about six months ago. It was just too much of a struggle. Too much waking myself up in the middle of the night, absolutely murdering my teeth by grinding them. So every time I tried to move forward, had another set back. This is a positive site about Knoxville. Can't have someone in a bad headspace creating positive content.
But it's not dead. Long from it. Website is on the 99-yard-line. Content, about about halfway from being done with corralling the two month's worth. But have got my mo back. Momentum is moving forward.
Jeremy, if you want your money back, I'll write you a check out of my personal account (money from this Kickstarter is sitting in a separate bank account, and has not been touched). Just let me know.

Shirts are now on order. I'd sent out another round of messages to folks about their shirt sizes a few weeks back. Have less than half, overall, that have responded with sizes and contact info. So I'm just guesstimating what sizes will be correct, hope people get in touch with me with their addresses.
Jeremy Pawelek

So, what's the update on this project? It's been 11 months, did anyone get any backer rewards?
Jody CollinsCreator
over 7 years ago
Marsha,
Here's what's gonna happen, I'm going to send you a check for your donation from my personal account. As far as being ""duped"", no. All of the money, save what Kickstarter and Amazon withdrew, is a separate account and sitting there.
I've been working on the development of the actual site more in the past couple months while trying to get all the t-shirt sizes wrapped up. Again, this has proven more cumbersome than I originally thought. I don't want to place the order for the shirts without all the sizes wrapped up.
Back to the ""duped"" part. No one's been duped. When creating a Kickstarter project they ask that you put target dates in there. Would you feel better had I put April 2014? I put May cause I thought it'd be a lot easier to get everything handled by then. What you're not seeing in the back end is the fact that I joined three additional non-profit Board Of Directors. That those three, in addition to my regular amount of community outreach, has left me with not a lot of sleep over the course of this year. I'm working in the community, working on trying to make Knoxville better.
The Eight Six Five should be, and will be, a project of my love of this town. I'm not going to apologize anymore. I'm tired. As much as you want this project up and going, I want it ten fold. That ten fold is a weight on my shoulders every single day. That weight is gonna be there until I can do it right.
Again, I'm not taking your money out of the Kickstarter fund. I'm repaying you personally. That said, you will not receive any of the rewards. This post will serve as proof that you would like to revoke any ties to this project.
Take care,
Jody

Full of care, emotion, and intelligence. A traveling show like no other. The Humble Hobo and his imaginations arrived on my doorstep not twenty minutes ago.
Today was just one of those days that makes your head and stomach ache, nothing earth shattering, just a lousy day. Or at least it was. When I went out to get the mail, my mind brightened immediately. Suddenly, today was worth it.
There are many reasons I enjoy this body of work, but subtly is King among them. There is a wonderful depth to the craft of these images, something that can only be gained from many silent hours spent practicing and refining ones art. There is a tremendous story not only in the images themselves, but the journey of their creation. All the sketches, the color tests, the quiet observation, it's all there; buried in each painting. This is the story that rewards the patient and persistent viewer, the sign of real art.
I don't know if Shane has ever considered why it is that he paints, but if the goal is to make a connection through image crafting, to tell a genuine story, to affect someone on an emotional level for the better... mission accomplished.

On the packaging dilemma: could people supply their own containers? Non-fizzy beer can be good too--just ask the Brits.
Whatever ""we"" come up with, I hope it's reusable.

How about you rent some capacity in one of the existing breweries, brew a batch, see if it is any good and find out if the public actually wants to buy it.
Way it is going now, trying to locate a facility with access to clean water, CO2 storage, getting equipment with inadequate funds, I doubt it is going to happen, not with what is left of the 110 K Canadian $.

Hi JP, Thanks for the thoughtful suggestion on investigating contract brewing - we will certainly be exploring all options in the process of reworking the business plan. If you had a chance to listen to the Lagered Tales podcast update, Steve talks about some of the market research we have already started to find out what style of beer and recipes seem to resonate with local drinkers - and that work will continue too. As for the other steps to opening they are ones we started the project with, and ones we still believe can be achieved! The money raised through this Kickstarter has not been touched, all project expenses to date have been covered by Beau's as part of our mandate to make the world a better place through brewing beer. Thank you again for backing this project.

I'm glad you like our time and tide tees, we are very proud of what we achieved with that range.
I really hope we can make this happen. The t-shirts from our last range were great quality, but this time we have unisex t-shirts with an even softer feel and a better cut.
We have defiantly stepped up a level in terms of quality on this range.

THIS WAS SOOOOO TOUCHING I THOUGHT I HAD TO SHARE:
From my mom: PLEASE READ and PASS ALONG!
""Dear Noonie,
Being a little behind in the social media world I am watching this Kickstarter thing with no small amazement.
We knowingly acknowledge the achievement of the famous- We are all on board with Rembrandt or Kahlo, but how often do we think about the artist before he or she was The Artist, when making truth out of pigment and a square of white canvas was a compelling but lonely, uncertain activity? How many ‚Äúart lovers‚Äù would see in the early unknown and unchampioned work of a peasant miller‚Äôs son the long and illustrious career of Rembrandt, or could connect with the tortured introspection of a young Mexican girl of mixed Hungarian ‚ÄìJewish heritage? The early appreciators of an emerging artist are in many ways essential to that artist‚Äôs survival as a creative force- even the greatest genius needs to eat, and rejection and discouragement take a toll. If the essence of art is an interaction between the creator and her audience, its survival and development is often an interaction between the creator and her patrons.
I wish I could send you a pope or a Medici-or a Medici pope-to underwrite your endeavors. (Even Michelangelo‚Äôs projects got a little out of hand as he struggled to express on flat plaster the workings of his inventive imagination.)
If 400 friends, admirers and just kind strangers send you $25 each, your project is funded. If 200 friends, admirers and just kind strangers send you $50 your project is a reality. Unbelievable.
This is a hard climate to ask for money, but you have little choice but to ask and be grateful for what people can spare. What is meant to happen will happen, but if they can the friends, admirers and just kind strangers who see what you are capable of will try to help you get there. And you will always remember-and celebrate- their kind investment in your remarkable potential.
~Your Mom""

I can't believe I won!!! I never win anything and this is such an incredible prize. Cornelia has been one of my dearest friends for more than 17 years. I have watched her grow as an artist and it has been an amazing journey. I will hang this peice in my home with honor. I think I saw it at every stage in its creation. I never thought I would be able to afford one of these remarkable pieces and I am so excited that I will have an original from one of Cornelia's first collections to call my own. I know what this painting means to you, Noon, and I thank you from the bottom of my heart for allowing me to give it a home. Please encourage everyone you know to support Cornelia's dream. She never does anything small, this is a grand endeavor and I certainly just won a grand prize.",13

Hey guys,
Hope all is well with your project. I donated to your project on PayPal right after it was funded unsuccessfully on Jul 5,2016. I was promised that I would get the wind turbine keychain and my name on the plaque outside the the wind turbine facility if I donated through PayPal which is what I did. I never heard back from you guys so just wondering if my name which is Chase Markoff made it on the plaque.
Hope all is well,

Hello Natanael, thank you for your support and your interest. All the planets will indeed be visible but not with the same success.
Uranus and Neptune will be more like dots due to the distance. Pluton is on the limit of the resolution of the instruments but it will be possible to have a faint dot with enough exposure time.
Mercure is also visible but you won't get any surface details. It is a very small body
The other planets will offer a better show.
And besides, even if you didn't mentioned it, the sun will be observable with our instruments. Don't miss it. You will be surprised.

Bummed to have thrown away so much money buying these shirts never to even receive a response from the company about my quality control issue. There is no way that holes should appear in clothes sitting at a desk 8 hours a day within a handful of wears. My IceBreaker Merino wool shirts don't have holes, and I'd had them for MUCH longer by the time I made my last comment. Even 6 months later only one of the IceBreakers had a run. Both of the Peak to Plateau shirts are in completely unwearable condition from light handling. I don't even tumble dry my clothes. :-(

A little bummed about how flimsy the shirts are for the price. I've worn them each maybe half a dozen times, and they both have holes in them... I work in IT and don't do anything that demanding of attire. ‚òπÔ∏è

hey guys, just wanted to let you know that the shipment just came through - thanks for re-sending. the shirt is a little thinner than i was expecting, but it feels great. nice work!

I still have not received anything, not my original shipment or the ""reshipment"" that you said you sent on 2 August 2017. Surely paying for some kind of tracked shipping is cheaper than losing 2 separate packages? This is ridiculous, certainly the worst follow-up ""support"" I've seen on kickstarter yet.

How do I track down my order? I visited backerkit and the project is closed. I have no record of receiving a tracking number.
I backed ""The Complete Kit"" and was backer 262

Hi Ben. I will resend your order, sorry about the massive delay!

Hi guys, just following up on mine as well, as it hasn't yet arrived. Looking at the tracking details on DHL, it looks like it took about 10 days to go from NZ to Germany, a month to get to Toronto, and there's been no update in the month since then. Any help?

Ty, we have resent your order as yours likely got lost. Should arrive in a week or two.

I've received my nomad crew last month. 2 days before my climbing expedition. Luckily. Thanks!
Reaction:
It feels amazing to the body. Though, rather light: i would want some more yak;-) in it. I was wearing it every evening and it was great - not too warm/not too cold in conditions: -5C, above 4,000 meters.
My only ""dislike"" is how cuffs are designed. I would like to suggest in your next (2.0) design, to add elastic cuffs (example: Marmot Variant Jacket: https://marmot.com/men-jackets-and-vests/variant-jacket/84700.html?cgid=men_jackets-and-vests&dwvar_84700_color=1453&dwvar_84700_size=000025L#start=1). Current cuffs just don't stay put on hand... elastic band would definitely help a lot.
Also, lose printed logo on the cuffs - it looks rather ""cheap"" and make whole garmet look ""cheap"". Again, look how Marmot (Above mentioned link) designed their logo on the shoulder.
Last, but not least: While i truly appreciate your effort to send photos from the plateau and the idea is absolutely fantastic, i truly believe that it could've been implemented better - printing it in super small and cutting it with scissors is not how it's done. Again, idea is brilliant, but implementation is rather ...
Again, thanks for the project and an opportunity to have Yak Wool crew!!!

Anyone else in USA still not received their pledge? I'm continually being told to wait longer on a package that hasn't arrived, a full month of it being in the US would suggest it's never going to arrive. Can anyone else say if they haven't received their pledge, Stefan seems to suggest there's more people still waiting on theirs too. Very disappointed with the overall follow-up from the creator and won't be recommending them to others over here.

Remember my yearbooks! Even after all these years, I love looking back on them. I can't wait to design my own 1/8 page, while munching on my Cheetos because I am COOL and reading my thank-you note. Good luck and keep up the good work!
