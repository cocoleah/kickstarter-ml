When will we be hearing about physical reward fulfillment? An ETA range for that would be nice
Aubry K.Creator
over 1 year ago
Hi Allie! If you mean the merchandise being shipped out, it'd be when the game is closer to release next year. If you mean the backer's survey, that's on us - we've been caught up in publisher negotiations for longer than anticipated, and kickstarter fulfillment duties have been part of the talks. While we'd love to give a more concrete date, we don't want to promise anything until it's set in stone, so all we can say is that we hope to be able to send those out soon. Thank you for asking!

I just want to say that I tried out the demo, and it was mighty impressive! It's one of the most neatly presented demoes I've seen for a VN. The gap between the stretch goals and the base funding goal looks quite wide right now, but I hope you reach them. :)
Also, I like that you've tried not to be too ambitious with your schedules. No reason to rush this beautiful work of art.

PageLess just helped Joe save $385.00 on his textbooks. Joe needed a bunch of books and and a bunch of access codes. He was given the package ISBNs and told to buy them. PageLess tore those ISBNs apart and got Joe all the content he needed for class. More importantly, we made sure he didn't buy a lot of extra stuff he didn't need. The cheapest price for Joe's books on the internet was $556.00. PageLess got him down to $171.00. PageLess really does work. With your help, we can get it out into the world!",1

funktoastCreator

Kickstarter Addict, you are amazing. Thanks for checking in.
I totally get budgetary constraints. There are still 22 days left on this sick and twisted experiment. If you want to get only 1 of the hypno-nightmares, it only requires an $8 pledge and you get your pick from 1 of 4. If this KS goes well, I will probably do a sequel set of nightmares. I imagine if that happens, these will become available again at that time.
That being said, if you don't want to jump in now, just contact me when you are ready and we can work something out.
Most of all, keep being scared.
Sweet dreams,

Hi All
Please note that the uTasker project now supports (for Blaze users) the following new capabilities:
- Integrated TCP/IP services reachable via USB via RNDIS or via SLIP/PPP on serial
- Optional FreeRTOS scheduling in parallel with the uTasker co-operative scheduler for a perfect combination of pre-emptive and co-operative characteristics.
- Blaze operation as MODBUS master and/or slave via USB, serial or TCP
- Complete simulation in Visual Studio http://www.utasker.com/kinetis/BLAZE_K22.html

@Jon, I may well just do that. Last time I attempted a WordPress site, I couldn't find the right plugins to do what I wanted and spent more time hunting for the right ones than it took me to code the side from scratch.
The GitHub site is still available - in fact, its almost ready for the latest commit with Arduino IDE support. https://github.com/roobituk/Blaze

Thanks for the update Kevin, I appreciate it! (Also php7 is one of the fastest nowadays, so for scalability depending on how you structure your db and frontend, it may be worth sticking with it.)
Kevin WebsterCreator
almost 4 years ago
@Jon, the website is currently under development - although I'm not sure why its coming up with a 500 error as it should be showing an ""under construction"" page.
I made the decision to outsource the website to an external developer however, this hasn't gone at all to plan and the result wasn't what I'd requested so I'll be re-developing the website myself.
The old website wasn't scalable and was something I'd hand-coded in php/html5. I'd hoped to have everything moved over to a WordPress site but like I say, this couldn't have been any more of a bad idea.
Please keep checking back at getblaze.co.uk, I aim to have something up within a couple of weeks - new forum (the old one had big issues), new shop (better implementation), a portal for developers (with actual, real content) and more hardware and software information.
Over the past few months, I've been working on programming Blaze through Arduino IDE and am currently working on supporting the standard Arduino libraries. I can now 100% confirm that it is possible to program Blaze via the Arduino IDE. Standard functions such as digitalWrite/digitalRead/analogRead are supported so far as well as some primitive graphical functions (including a demo showing 300+fps redrawing). I know this feature was requested a number of times during the Kickstarter campaign and hopefully now it will open up Blaze to a wider user-base as I appreciate that the KDS examples on the GitHub site are for the more advanced user and not at all hacker-friendly.
As I'm a mostly-Windows developer, I'll be releasing to GitHub the tools necessary for Blaze to work within Arduino IDE. If anyone would take these across to Linux/OSX, I'd be extremely grateful.

Sorry for the lack of responses to comments of late.
@kr4kon Is your Blaze board fried? Drop me a private message and I can arrange a repair if you wish? The chip close to the micro USB connector is a TVS diode for transient suppression on the USB signals. As Mark mentioned, the +3V3 is output only and should only be used to provide power to other devices - no power source should be connected to these pins.
@Mark, thanks again for your fantastic uTasker support and examples. Also, you are right, I think a flow diagram showing power and other such connectivity would be a good idea and help backers understand the ins and outs of the Blaze boards.
@Chris, please do let me know when/if something turns up.
@Eric, you should have received your replacement boards by know. Please come back to me if you have not.
@Anthony, I will be uploading the updater source to the GitHub site this evening. I've also investigated the forum and I've been able to recreate the problem you have indicated. I *believe* that this is now fixed but please try again and let me know.

@mark appreciate the info. I managed to find the cause of the problem. Fried one of the small chip on the blaze board itself near the microusb input. I'll just another order of the board soon. So glad it wasn't the IOT board. Could have mistakenly snapped both boards together in a wrong position due a busy schedule. Lesson learned. Gonna check out your utasker in abit

Only thing I can really add as a possible idea is that if the Shiny Eeveelutions come out, those would be glittery versus the normal ones since technically they are shiny, it would make sense in that regard. But I mean, glitter on any of the pins would be pretty cool too. No matter what the decision, I still feel like I'll be happy with the pins. :3

Omg that makes a lot of sense! I should combine those 2 elements and have shiny eeveelutions be literally shiny!!
That case I'll come up with a new stretch goal to replace the current shiny tier; consider the shiny+ glitter unlocked!
Thank you so much for the feedback I had a mindblown moment haha

I went with the Early Bird option, but can I add on more pins for the same pin price? I would like 1 additional pin
YuuCreator
5 months ago
Hi, I only allowed 1 pin at the discounted price per backer because I was only ready to have 50 pins pledged at the discounted rate >_< changing it now could be unfair to other people.. but I am thinking of adding some bonuses for people who got the early birds but add on at the regular price to make up for it 😉

It’s been a tad bit over a half a year since the last update could I ask when the 3DS port is coming? It seems to not be happening, so if it isn’t could I at least have the PC version? Thanks
Tomas GuinanCreator

Hey James, I've sent you a Steam key.
The 3DS version has run into some technical issues. A straight port of the PC version is a lot more difficult than I had initially expected, even if I were to limit it to new 3DS systems. I'm currently exploring some other platforms for release as well, but I haven't totally given up on 3DS yet.

Hi Tomas. Just received game and all arrived in perfect condition in the UK, and must say it's one excellent package, from the quality materials used, brilliant box art on game box, vinyl and cd(looks like an original NES cart) to the full colour manual and game cart itself. Oh and the game is great too. Been a pleasure supporting this kickstarter, well done mate.

Game finally arrived in UK on Wednesday after being held up at customs. In the end had to pay $26 CAD duty including $14 processing fee! The UK punitively sting you if you don’t pay import duty/VAT (sales tax) in advance. I’m surprised Kickstarter don’t recommend a delivery service that includes import duty in the price.

Tomas GuinanCreator

Sorry for any disappointment. Besides the first 5 numbers being reserved for the highest backer tier, the rest of the numbered cartridges were packed at random. This was the same way I handled my last Kickstarter and had no complaints. Between cancelled backers, variations on soundtrack options/packaging size, and the fact that the shipping fulfillment program I used did not account for backer numbers, organizing every reward by chronological backer number would have been a pretty difficult task.

Hi Gary, we keep the machine and lead screws well oiled. We've put hundreds of hours on ours. We oil them before starting a print job and if it's a long run we'll oil them periodically during the print. We've even run very long print jobs of over 40 hours using this approach and haven't seen any problems ... Dante

I own a Sherline and a Taig. I have tried this idea and found it wears out the leadscrew nuts very quickly. The issue is the XYZ axes are ""tight"" to maintain accuracy for CNC. Regular 3D printers are only pushing around a lightweight print head. The CNC machine is pushing much more weight in the form of friction and mass. 3D printing is brutal on them. Have you found a solution for this?",3

@Conquer119: We perform most of our work using Simplify3D as the slicer, however we have tested and used Slic3r as well. An advantage of Simplify3D is that it has a parameter we can set for the next X/Y coordinates, so that all of the hotends of the Multex4Move are covered when in motion and NOT printing (Called “free travel” in Simplify3D). Using the Multex2Move or the Multex4Move in conjunction with the free printing action, you can avoid stringing between printed areas. This means that with the Multex4Move you can avoid stringing problems in single material prints as well as prints using multiple materials.
One of the tasks we are currently working on is to add this functionality directly into the firmware. This will allow other slicers capable of handling multiple materials to take advantage of this functionality.
As to your question about the printer, we are offering our award-winning 3D printer Multirap M420 in this campaign as a reward: the Multriap M420 with 4Move as a construction kit. The Multirap has been distributed at Multec for 3 years and is a precise, stable and long-lasting 3D printer with print range up to 40cm: 210mmx400mmx220mm printing area.
Frage und Antwort in deutscher Übersetzung:
Conquer119: Gibt es Software, die den 4Move unterstützt?
Wenn es Software dazu gibt, ist das auch Freeware?
Warum liefert Ihr nicht auch einen Drucker über die Kickstarter-Kampagne?
Antwort von Multec:
Wir arbeiten meist mit Simplify3D als Slicer, haben jedoch auch Slic3r schon eingesetzt. Ein Vorteil von Simplify3D ist, dass es eine Variable bietet für die nächste Position in X/Y-Koordinaten. Damit können für freies Verfahren ohne zu drucken alle Düsen abgedeckt werden können (in Simplify3D wird das mit „free travel“ bezeichnet).
Beim Einsatz des 2Move und des 4Move kann so auch das mit Strining bezeichnete Problem des Fadenziehens zwischen den Druckbereichen komplett verhindert werden. Das geht sowohl beim Multi-Material-Druck als beim Single-Druck.
Ein Thema, das wir derzeit weiter entwickeln ist die Integration dieser Funktion in die Firmware. Das wird dann erlauben, auch bei anderen Slicern diese tolle Funktion einzusetzen.
Bezüglich der Frage nach dem Drucker, wir bieten unseren bewährten und hervorragenden 3D-Drucker Multirap M420 mit Multex4Move als Bausatz in dieser Kampagne ebenfalls als Belohnung an. Der Multirap M420 wird schon seit 3 Jahren vertrieben, ein langlebiger, stabiler und präziser 3D-Drucker mit einer Druckfläche von bis zu 40cm:
Druckfläche 210mmx400mmx220mm. Wir werden in der Kampagne noch deutlich die technischen Daten des Gesamtdruckers beschreiben, vielen Dank für den Hinweis!

@Andy T: Update with the weights - Including the torque motor, the 2Move weighs about 1.17kg, and the 4Move weighs 1.27kg.
Multec GmbHCreator

Für unsere deutschen Besucher die Übersetzung der Anfrage von Andy T:
AndyT: Kann der Multex2Move später einfach zu einem Multex4Move aufgerüstet werden? Bietet Ihr die Komponenten zu diesem Umbau an für den Differenzbetrag der beiden early-bird und regulären Geräte an? oder auch zu einem 3Move
Multec: Ja, wir können die Teile liefern um einen 2Move zu einem 3Move oder 4Move umzubauen. Da aber manche Teile komplett getauscht werden müssen, arbeiten wir noch an der Preisermittlung. Aber es sollte nicht viel mehr betragen als die Differenz.
AndyT: Der Metallhalter zwischen dem Motor und dem Hotend-Kopf sieht schwach aus, ist das wirklich die Struktur oder ist es tatsächlich eine geschlossene Box?
Multec: Der Halter ist aus 4mm Alumiumprofil, er ist stark und erprobt. Wir möchten hier nicht mehr Gewicht als notwendig einbauen. Die zusätzliche Abdeckung ist ein Druckteil, das leicht abgenommen werden kann für gute Zugänglichkeit.
AndyT: Wie lange dauert es bis die Abdeckscheibe voll von Kunststofftropfen ist, bis sie gereinigt werden muss? Zeigt bitte ein unbearbeitetes Zeitraffervideo von einem großen, mehrfach-farbigem Druckteil mit wasserlöslichem Support und zeigt danach, wieviel Kunststoff sich auf der Scheibe aufbaut.
Multec: Die Düsen werden beim Multex4Move verschlossen, so dass auf der Scheibe so gut wie kein Kunststoff verbleibt, da kann nichts tropfen. Im Moment testen wir drei zusätzliche Reinigungsmethoden für sehr lange Drucke - aber da ist fast nichts zu reinigen. Wir haben viel gedruckt, sowohl lange als auch kurze Drucke - ohne dazwischen zu reinigen.
Wir werden natürlich so bald wie möglich und laufend weitere Videos zu den Geräten zeigen.
AndyT: Wieviel wiegt der 4Move und der 2Move, insgesamt, mit dem Drehmotor?
Multec: Der 2Move wiegt etwa 1,17kg, der 4Move 1,27kg inklusive Drehmotor.
Multec GmbHCreator

@Andy T: I have the answers to some of your questions below. Others we are working on.
1) We can provide the parts for converting the 2Move into a 3Move and/or 4Move, these kits we will provide as soon as possible. But as some parts have to be exchanged completely, we are still working on defining the price. It should not be much more than the difference however.
2) That´s a 4mm Aluminum bracket holder, it´s strong and approved. We prefer to not adding any more weight to this holder than necessary. The covering box is a printed part, and it can be easily removed for accessibility.
3) As the nozzle are actually closed off by the disk there is nearly no ooze on the disk itself. At the moment we are testing three different additional cleaning devices for very long prints – but there is not a lot to clean. We have done a lot of prints, both shorter ones and longer ones, all without cleaning the disk in between.
4) Of course, we will show some videos concerning your question as soon as possible.
5) Regarding the mass, we will check this in a few hours and get back to you.
Andy TSuperbacker

@Creators: Can the Multex2Move be easily converted later to a Multex4Move? Are you willing to provide the components to do so for the difference in the pledge levels between the two (early bird/early bird, regular/regular, etc)? Or additional half way in cost for a '3Move?
The sheet metal bracket between the motor and the hot end carousel looks really flimsy. Is that really the structure or is it actually a closed box?
How long before the wiper disk gets full of scraped-off ooze to the point where it needs to be cleaned out?
Please show an unedited time-lapse of a large model, multicolor build, with soluble supports and at the end of the build, show the scrapeoff buildup.
How much mass is in the '2Move and the '4Move, respectively, including the carousel motor?

I really like seeing how you are hitting all the options, including an ace one with the fairies.
I do have to say, that the initial funding target makes me worried - it feels a little low-ball for any game. Having said that, you hit it in 5 days, so, your final value ought to set my mind at ease.
I'd also say - get an editor. at least a short-term (one week) one to read your script before you implement it, and a second one (short term again) to proof everything after you are ""done,"" independent of your beta testers, if you don't go for a full time one. having a trained pair of eyes is useful, and when you your words are so critical to the final product, having someone specifically to safe guard them, and their presentation, is important.

The clock will have to be at another time as both that and the chandelier are very expensive to make compared to the others ( having multiple molds and 3D parts makes them about 1k each to fund on their own) I’d still like to at some point but I may just fund it myself.",10

I HAD to back this show simply because I NEED to see how these very talented puppeteers bring the story to life. Both Katie and Tony are extremely skilled in what they do and they are lovely people. They have the knack of bringing out the imagination in all of us. Nice people are hard to come by, nice people that need our help totally deserve it.

Creativity of this magnitude is not commonplace, by backing this project you'll be supporting so many valuable talents in an age where the arts, creatives and designers are thought be luxuries our 'struggling economy' can't afford. Mumblecrust shows without any wavering the value of creation and imagination, and that should always be supported. Give what you can, and tell who you know!

I think this is a great project to support and I am happy to make a contribution. These two very talented young people have already proved their worth with the 'Tale of the Cockatrice' (such a brilliant puppet! ) and will, I am sure do great things with the Time Machine. It feels an honor to make a modest contribution towards helping them develop what is sure to be a great show, which I am confident will be another step in their growing careers producing outstanding entertainment. Brilliant stuff!

Just to add briefly to my Dreamcast rantings, and to show that my writing improved somewhat from when I was 16, here is an article I wrote about the Dreamcast back in 2012.
https://littlefishmag.wordpress.com/in-depth/more-than-a-dream/
Andrew DickinsonSuperbacker
over 2 years ago
Not had chance to read through it fully yet, but my flip through the digital copy made me smile so much! Love the layout, the design, the different sections... So much detail! From what I read, everything is well written too. I love the library and time line at the back, and I am already super excited to see what Year Two will bring!
It got me thinking about other 'failed' consoles, and how this format you've created could be great for them, especially the Sega Dreamcast. There is already a project that aims to be a very high-end look at the Dreamcast in book form, with lots of development images etc (which I can't wait to read), but a more unofficial story about the Dreamcast year-by-year could be super interesting I think. It'd be an opportunity to maybe interview lower key players too, who get overlooked in larger releases. Speaking to people who wrote for the Official Dreamcast Magazine for example, or people who helped develop some of the lesser known titles. Waaaaaay back in the day I wrote (very badly) for dreamcastsource.co.uk (which is still available to browse!), so I was around and active in the UK Dreamcast community for the three years it was on the market here. It is my favourite console of all time, and I'm thinking that maybe the time is right to explore the Dreamcast like you have explored the Vita, and I'd love to maybe chat with you about that, Sandeep!
Anyway, back on topic... Love the book! Cannot wait to sit down and read it properly, cover to cover! You've done a fantastic job!

I just want to thank the creator for this project. When the NES classic edition came out, I was really disappointed with the supply shortages. This project (I got the kit) took a day for me to make, and multiple evenings for me to ""procure"" the Roms. I am so pleased with what I now have. It has come with me on 3 business trips, and one camping trip. I also have it setup in my home for whenever the urge arrives. Many thanks for the awesome project.

Like Pernicious Ducks said, there are tools to ""enhance"" the image so it looks good on our HDTVs. Here is a good article to get you started: https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup/wiki/Shaders-and-Smoothing. I noticed, especially on Genesis games, that HD makes the image look bad.
PerniciousDucksSuperbacker
almost 4 years ago
@Mark what do you mean by enhanced graphics? Most of the ROM community focuses on trying to make them as retro authentic as possible. I'm using retropie and a shader to add screen lines and screen curve at the edges to make it feel like I'm playing on an old CRT. Sure is making Secret of Mana fun to play again...

Great question Mr. Corcoran, this is exactly what keeps me from upgrading to lifetime! Excited for the answer 👍🏻
Gerry Corcoran
almost 2 years ago
Hey folks!
Sorry if this is redundant but I scrolled through a bunch of comments quickly and didn't see this asked. I am currently pledged at the lifetime membership tier (which is over $430CDN for me) but I have one concern before I lock that in.
Are you able to reveal any more about what some of your future titles or publishing partners are going to be? I ask because a lot of the logos shown on the campaign page are the same batch of Data East and Technos games that they will license to anyone willing to pay and that are in a number of recent retro collections (most of the games in that logo graphic can be found in both Johnny Turbo's Arcade and on systems like the Super Retro-Cade.) Titles like GODS also have remasters out in other places now too.
I absolutely love what you're putting together here but we really need to see more than a lot of the predictable titles that are appearing everywhere else. Do you have more extensive partnerships with other publishers lined up so that we can expect more games that might be different than what you commonly see?
Thanks very much!

Heya Jo!
I appreciate that contracts and non-disclosure are what they are. I work in Managed IT and oh yeah, we got a lot of those. :)
That you already have licenses for 1,500 more games beyond the initial launch definitely puts Anstream miles ahead of just about anything else so that gives me a lot of confidence. I was planning to pledge either way, it was just a question of whether I wanted to go full lifetime or not. Looking at the budget this month, I think I'll probably be keeping it there. :)
Also, unrelated but I'm the Developer Relations Envoy for theSHED Community, a large and growing gaming community with a huge streamer contingent and a lot of retro players to boot. We're forming what are called Community Partnerships with cool game makers and I've been trying to chat with you folks about that. I've sent a couple of e-mails through your contact form and hadn't heard back but I know you've all been crazy busy with the campaign.
If you're interested in hearing about this idea (I've got some informational materials and it's also not something we're asking money for), feel free to send me an e-mail from the contact form at https://pxa.ca.
Good luck!
JoCollaborator

Thanks Gerry, and thanks for the support!
I believe we have some details on SHED already that we were sent a week or so ago but with the hype of Play Expo and the kickstarter campaign I don't think we've had chance to move thee forward. However, if you would like to send over any details fire them over to Jo.Clifford@antstream.com and I'll take a look :) I know we would love to work with content creators either during early access or the beta period so the more the merrier. We would just need to nail down the details.

For early access it will likely be 2-3 weeks after the kickstarter has ended, this is to make sure that everything is done behind the scenes on kickstarters end at the end of the campaign, as there's a bit of tidying up and admin to do as I'm sure you'll understand :) Once this is out of the way though we'll start rolling out those early access codes!

FOR AKEMARI:
We do not raise funds for charity! We do not raise funds for treatment!
All of this was mentioned only to attract attention and to laugh. (We used to laugh at all the difficulties. It really helps to survive).
We sell copies of the game, which will be released by the end of the year. This money will be spent on fees to artists, composer and programmer-screenwriter.
We do not ask a lot, to get at least something.
Thank you for your advice! We are not businessmen. We do not know how it works. We just asked for some money for our fees.

I have a question about the $80 and $100/125 pledge tiers. I have a idea for a background character in the goblin world, but I also think it'd be cool to have the image file that's mentioned in the $100 pledge level. Should I pledge at the $100/125 tier? Are there goblins in the pre-demo-fight world?
Gabe HicksCreator

Totally fair question and yes! That character could be a goblin if you'd like! The portal is considered an alternate plane so there could easily be doppelgangers ;) If you wanted to get the character sprite AND the bg it'd be pledging the $100 and then just then clicking manage pledge and upping it to $125

Related to Charlotte's question about the add-on goblin OC for the $100 tier, do we just alter our original pledge to $125 to get that?
Gabe HicksCreator

For the background character design yes!

This is an interesting idea. I'm quite the fan of visual novels and this one looks different from the norm. You know, I never knew I wanted to date some goblins, but there you go. Also, I am a sucker for high fantasy setting in general.
What especially interests me is the attempt to add elements of actual role play into this. This certainly makes this stick out (as well as your goblins, of course). I do hope all goes well for you and I also hope to see this project go places.
Best of luck!

The $25 add-on to goblin one's oc; is that an After the Kickstarter Closes thing, or should I bump the pledge itself up to $125 now?
Gabe HicksCreator
over 1 year ago
totally fair question~! If you backed at the 100 for your OC, if you bump it up to $125 now then you'll be all set!

Hello,
I've got a friend who also is very excited about this project, but they do not have a credit card. Would it be possible to add a tier where we could pledge for 2 copies of the game so I can help my friend out? =)

Juste a question about another add-on :
Do you plan to update enhanced-priority-display to work with TB 78 and more ?
Thanks a lot :)

I was wondering if it would be possible to change the formatting of the ""Send Later"" column in the Drafts folder. Currently it does not follow the system settings for date/time formatting.

Hi Jonathan, thanks for the great work on running this campaign and updating Send Later!
I was wondering, if there is any extra money left over was it decided where it would go yet, or what are the chances of it going towards ""AttachmentExtractor Continued"" / ""Save/Open/detach/delete all attachments in multiple/many selected messages""? I remember one of the survey questions you sent us being about other addons we're interested in - out of all the ones I mentioned my vote would go towards this one. I'd even pay for it if there was another campaign. There are some comments in the reviews section on the addons website expressing how essential it is, and in bugzilla bug 92146 which has been a feature request for 20 years, so I wonder if the demand is there? For me I'm glad to have kept Send Later going but unfortunately I won't be updating to TB 78 without AttachmentExtractor unless I'm forced to. (The addon author said it was too much work to update, I'm just assuming it's technically possible though?)

Hallo Jonathan,
I am using TB 78.5.0 on several machines with WIN 10 Pro.
Send later does not work for me. The button is there. But if I use ""send later"" the following happens: the message is shifted into the folder ""drafts"". Thereafter nothing happens. It stay there, is not sent after 5 minutes as intended. The column ""send later"" does not show in this folder. I do not know which mistake I have made, if any at all. Need help.
Thanks

Hi Jonathan(s)
Thank you for the good work.
I have just installed the send later add-on 8.1.0 with TB 78.4.2.
I have noticed two points:
1) impossible to modify the toolbar to have the preset delayed times to show up.
2) when replying to a message with send later, the little 'reply' arrow doesn't appear close to the message as was present with send later in TB prior to 78.
If you could look at these issues, that would be great.
Thank
Bruno

My thunderbird has just updated to 78.4.0 (32-bit).
I have installed the last beta version of the send-later (send_later-8.0.12-tb.xpi).
I am using Send Later with IMAP account and i don't have any Outgoing email folder.
When i press the send later button, the dialog appears, but when i confirm I don't see more the email, nor in draft or other folder.
Letterally disappear and, conseguently, nothiiing is send at the time scheduled
Is there anything I can do to set the ""storage"" folder?
Thank you and BR

My guess is that you have more than one Drafts folder and you're looking for the scheduled messages in the wrong one, but that's just a guess. Please reach out to Jonathan Perry-Houts <jph@extended-thunder.org> for direct assistance with this.

My thunderbird has just updated to 78.4.0 (32-bit). I have installed the last beta version of the send-later (send_later-8.0.11-tb.xpi).
The messages are sent to the draft folder and the send later column appear correctly, but when the date/time arrives it does not send the message at all.
Is there something else that I should do?

Jonathan, any progress on ToggleReplied? I was looking through the Thunderbird 78+ WebExtension / MailExtension APIs, and there doesn't see to be anything that exposes the ""Replied"" property of a message. Maybe I'm missing something. Will it be possible to update ToggleReplied?

ToggleReplied is the add-on I will be turning my attention to next, but I don't have an ETA yet.
Ryan C Jenkins

I'm not sure if this is related to ""Toggle Replied"" not being available yet, but when responding to a message and clicking on ""Send Later"" it is not marking the message as replied. Unless I click ""Send Now"", it does not change the status.
I was wondering if it could also mark the message as read when replied?
Thank you for your work on these amazing add-ons.
Jonathan KamensCreator

Just to be clear, when you say, ""clicking on 'Send Later',"" are you referring to using the Send Later add-on to schedule a message for later delivery, or to using the ""Send Later"" button built into Thunderbird to put a message into your Outbox? Also, just to confirm, you're on TB78, correct?
Ryan C Jenkins

Honestly I didn't know there was a built-in ""Send Later"" in TB. I'm using the latest Send Later add-on (version 8.0.11). I'm running TB 78.4.0 64-bit on Windows 10.

How is the status for ""Show All body Parts""? On the Thunderbird Addons site you are still asking for donations. One might think that 50+ K dollars go a long way in programming (yes, I know, there were deductions, but it's still a five digit number of green bills).

There are no ""premium"" versions of my add-ons. There's just one version. And at least right now, it looks like I'm going to be able to use the funds from the Kickstarter to keep providing the add-ons for free, so there won't be a need for subscriptions. See the most recent posted updates.

While browsing Kickstarters’ technology category (as ya do) I came across your project and was intrigued.
I don’t use Thunderbird, and never have, but I know it’s free. Your add-ons must have a devoted user base for you to ask for their financial support.
Interest piqued, I clicked the link and read on. I like your style and the world needs more developers like you so I pledged $50. Please use these funds as you see fit.

I have the ""Send Later"" addon installed for many years, used it a total of <20 times yet on the first day of the campaign I was going to pledge $500 but I couldn't!
I have never and never will support a project which is closed source, given that you are on the line of of making the project closed I really couldn't pledge, I have now decided to pledge $50 not because I need the addons but in order to support you to keep it open source
""... if the Kickstarter campaign succeeds, then I will look into the possibility of making the code open-source under copyright terms which prevents it from being used to compete with the licensed add-ons. I would love to do that if it turns out to be possible...""
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do your best to keep it open so everyone can freely inspect and make changes, I have no quarrels if you want to put in terms that it cannot compete with your licensed addon.
If you do close the source I will have no option but to stop using this addon and a waste of my $50

Given the campaign has passed it's goal - If you do decide to close the source I will appreciate if you refund the $50, if you decide to keep it open I will give you another $100

Just to be clear, I have no problem if you need to charge each user to pay for the development and to support your livelihood, that's perfectly fine - my issue is about it being open not free beer.
