In case anyone is interested, I have added support to the Arduino Nano firmware for GPS and automatic daylight savings time transitions. A fork of the code with the necessary changes is available at:
https://github.com/NedFreed/TFWordclock
The hardware mod necessary is quite simple: Attach a GPS module's Rx/Tx lines to digital I/O pins D4 and D5. With the new firmware in place the GPS will be detected and used automatically. The one second blinking LED is used as an indicator that the GPS is present and working: It now blinks in response to GPS data. (It's also a lot more accurate now...)
The time zone offset and daylight savings time rules are all built in at compile time. A modified version of the time zone dump utility zdump is provided which can be used to dump the zone information in the correct format from any computer that has the necessary zone files.
Comments are welcome.

That was also my point with some investors that will like to pushing me into the 60 minutes version of the TV SHOW. It's good to se what the audience think, also to show these data to the Producers that sometimes they think they are speaking for the audience :) thanks for this!
FOR PEOPLE THAT DIDINT FOLLOW ALL THE DISCUSSION: IT was a polemic about make a 30 minutes Tv show (short but focus the money in production) or a 60 minutes version (with more story but less visual quality). All related from the fact we will have the same budget.

Saw the update,
I say 30 mins if you drag the story you might lose the views I say leave something at the end of each episode so we want more like a WTF moment like the old ""24"" series I use to watch those and loved it. The new ""24"" does not capture it to me. Don't know if it's the actor or the story.

Hi Robertus,
Thanks.
Good idea on the Concept Art Rewards, I just added an option for all 8 ($40).
Best Wishes,
Darrel
Robertus
over 8 years ago
Hi Darrell,
Yes, clear and take your time about the quality of the models, sure
I was looking at the 8 available packages
There is a pledge with a max of 5, I was pointing in this direction ;)
To me I would gladly spent some extra for a pledge with 8 packs (and to support the project via this route)
Succes!
Darrel AndersonCreator
over 8 years ago
Thanks Artie, we are very excited about it, ant woking hard to make it fly.
Hi Robertus,
Thanks for the feedback. Nice to see another GroBoto owner/artist here.
We will release several models very quickly after funding is achieved. However, there are only a few that are ready for release. For most models, significant work is needed to get each one ready.
That is, naturally, the purpose of the project ...to support the work needed to prepare each model for release. It's vital to refine and organize the models so that each is truly useful to other artists. I would not want to simply dump all of this work — in its raw creatively-cahaotic state — out there in the world. That would likely lead to problems and frustration for those endeavoring to use the work.
If the work was ready for distribution, there would be no real need for this project. That said, we will do everything possible to release the models quickly — I was perhaps a bit conservative in my projection of the pace, but wanted to insure that I was allowing enough time to release quality models.
About your suggestion for 'pledges with more digital copies' -- what were you hoping to see? More Concept Art Packages, or was that part of your notion about including models in the rewards?
In any case, please know that I am as anxious to make these models available quickly as you are to have them in hand.
Best Wishes,
Darrel
Robertus
over 8 years ago
I already have a Groboto license
It would be nice to have pledges with more digital copies ?
The native Groboto files / obj formats: it would be great to have them earlier
They are already planned to be available if I have read well
It will pull people I think / hope if these files are added somehow at pledges and via this way earlier available to backers ?

As written in the reward description : ""Get EARLY ACCESS to the game once it goes live on Steam or wait a bit and get a DRM free key at full release!"" Also we never promised GOG keys explicitly, and have a limited access to those. However DM me and I'll hook you up with one!

Hi - I completely forgot I backed this game until I logged into Kickstarter today for the first time in a couple of years.

I've been playing this quite a lot by now, I like what has been done and where it is going. But I am missing the very thing I wanted most of all. ""Pure ASCII mode"" was promised boldly in the campaign and otherwise I would not have backed it. Please get this working! I am sure there are many other backers that care as much about this is I do and are still waiting impatiently.
ChaosForge LtdCreator
about 1 year ago
The mode is actually in the game (accessible by passing --console on the command line - this is pure SSH compatible ASCII output) but it's a bit broken - we need to put aside some time to fix and polish it, however we're crunching on more important (for the general populace ofc) features like melee and master traits, so it will take a bit more until we can sit and focus on ASCII mode. Apart from pure ASCII we will probably have also terminal emulation, and both of those features will be polished before 1.0 release!

Yes,. happened again. I load the game, am able to select ""tutorial"". The splash screen appears, I hear birdsong. Then everything stops.
And I mean everything. Control panel won't respond, nothing except actually powering down the PC. Major huge crash.
I won't try again on this PC, I will try again on my new one which arrived, and let you know if that works. But my current PC (apart from being windows 7) is a reasonable spec gaming machine that runs pretty much everything, so I'm a little puzzled why it's not behaving with Farmer's Life. Can send system specs if it would help you?

I checked further down in the comments and saw where the log files are. I've emailed the log files from yesterday's crash, and today's. The log files stop at exactly the same point, so that's presumably where it's worth looking first.

One of my earlier designs had an enormous defect rate (over 50%) and another had entirely wrong colors that I didn't notice in the factory photos because of the lighting. I got replacements and still met my shipping estimate, but it really stressed me out, LOL.
I always make sure that my KS friends have first crack at any new designs, since without this community, I wouldn't have ever been able to get this endeavor started.

Thank you Jess! I kind of thought that after a year of doing these I would feel settled and more confident in my designs, but now I'm starting to think that that sort of confidence just doesn't jive well with many creatives like myself. So thank you very much for the words of encouragement, they mean a lot!",8

My cubs arrived at the inward office of exchange in New York this afternoon! I know they're probably going to spend a lot more time in Customs or wherever, but I'm just really happy and relieved that they're getting closer!
If anything happens with those fuzzy versions that you posted on your Facebook, uh...I might want to buy myself some fuzzy Sugar Cubs too, because they look so nice to touch, but for now I am so going to treasure these Kickstarter plushies.

People, did it ever crossed your mind that sometimes unexpected things happen?
They appologised so many times for the delay! Stop pushing and be patient! I am sure that they are worth waiting! It's their first project and it is totally understandable that they might not provided themselves with a back up plan in case something went wrong... We all make mistakes! Let's be good to the people that engaged themselves in this project. It's not as easy as most of you may think... ❤❤❤

I totally agree. To say that we'd get our plushies in December and then push it back to January and then fall absolutely bloody silent is really rude. How hard is it to log in to Kickstarter and post an update so we don't have to chase you down on Facebook?

I’d highly suggest if you didn’t receive your package to report the campaign. It’s simply unprofessional that we get radio silence for weeks and no updates. I’m honestly at the point where I want a refund.

Excellent catch on that typo! $14 was the bookmark, not the Patches! I've now altered the price in BackerKit, which applies to everyone's orders instantly. Thanks for the heads-up!

MayticksCreator

Hi Matt!
That's a really important question! The glitter is added to recesses in the metal in an enamel base, and then for extra safety and smoothness, these bookmarks will be finished off a clear epoxy layer on the top. That glitter shan't be going anywhere it shouldn't!
I'm going to post an update with a video showing some of my other designs manufactured through my current company so I can better demonstrate what I mean, so keep an eye out for that!

I'd be interested in hearing some of the stories of the successes and the ""so this is what we learned when this blew up on us"" stories too.

@clive klugman the basic idea was that every backer can get just one restricted reward, but if at the end not all restricted rewards are gone we will consider some additional appreciation. So it would be great if you switch to the 45Euro reward to get all three boards. Also shipment costs consist out of a base fee and 2Euros per board. Thank you very much for your support we will do our best to deliver a great product, please stay with us!

This is complete bullshit! No response, no explanation. I've purchased every CIIC, I don't even listen to them anymore because this is so disappointing. I know delays happen, stuff gets pushed back, life happens. It wouldn't even bother me if this was updated periodically and CIIC would respond in some way to these comments and concerns.

Well it's 2017 and there has been no update on this project. That really is disappointing. If there was something that caused the documentary to be delayed or scrapped it would have been nice to be informed. Tons of updates during the campaign, and nothing since. It's been 3 years....

Hi Roger, I am sorry you did not receive your guitar, that stinks. I have received the rewards for my pledge, but I was just looking for an update on the actual project. There hasnt been any updates on that. Is it in process still? I was really interested in seeing this documentary completed. Sigh....

Hi Nial!
First of all, thank you again for backing the project, I really appreciate you helping me make Until I Gush Forth a reality.
I also truly appreciate your honest words and that you took the time to write such a long comment. I am sorry that you feel let down. I understand where your critique is coming from, but please let me explain a little bit of my thought process behind the points you mentioned:
The choice to not include any text other than the poem at the beginning was a very deliberate one – I see UIGF as a visual poem that speaks through imagery and not words. Personally, I feel like the introductory poem sets the tone for the following images without imposing too much on the viewers and allows them to make their own conclusions about the project.
The purpose of the zine was not to just showcase the images of the series, it was conceptualized to be the project itself, which is why I treated the whole design as if I was designing an exhibition – playing around with different image sizes, order and negative space. As the images themselves are already very dense it was important for me to give them room to breathe, hence the admittedly generous use of negative space.
I feel like the zine-format allows for a much less traditional and more experimental approach to design than a conventional photobook. This is also the reason why some of the images I’ve decided to show are rather tiny – it was important for them to work within the visual context they are presented. The design itself went through various iterations which involved a lot of dummy producing in order to come closest to the vision I had in my head for this project.
To be honest, this was my very first foray into crowd-funding and after reading your words I realize that I maybe should have given a little more background information on the project page in order to avoid people expecting to get something that I never intended to create. I’ve been working on this project intensely for such a long time so it was admittedly difficult to step outside my own head and look at the project with a neutral pair of eyes.
Once again, thank you for making this project come alive and also for the kind words.
Take care,
Esthaem

The zine arrived today. Nice work turning this around and getting it out quickly.
The screen printed banderole was a nice touch and looks great over the cover.
I love how well this zine has been printed onto top quality paper stock at really high def.
A couple of things I found a bit odd...
I expected there to be some writing in there explaining your photographs further and telling the reader what was going through your mind at the time of capture. Even some titles would of been nice. Going through it was like reading through a magazine that had all the text missing from it. Your work is dep and complex and would definatly of benefitted from some writing or something to fill those big white gaps.
Instead there is a LOT of blank spaces and even whole pages been left blank. If you had decided not to add any writing to accompany your work then you should of maybe used those blank pages and spaces to give the smaller photos a larger size or even add them to their own page and blow them up to full A5 size. Failing that then you could of added more art.
Personally I think you really missed a trick by leaving all that beautiful HQ paper blank by not filling it with text or used it better to display your work in much larger scale as some of the photos are tiny and would of looked great if taken up to a larger size. Its a real waste of that lovely paper.
I buy and read/go through alot of Zines of all types, shapes and sizes. I have to say that for a Zine costing €15 and using such beautiful paper and lavish decoration that I did feel it was a bit of a let down.
The photos are fantastic and I did really enjoy them and got them, but alot were not given their full glory by you choosing to only print them in such small scale leaving pages and pages worth of that paper blank. Just some titles and a few words would of improved the experience greatly.
I have a bunch of zines featuring similar photography and methods and they mostly all make use of ever square inch of paper, even if just printed on cheap 60gsm paper. Zine makers and photographers would kill to have the money to produce a zine on such nice paper with a great cover and screen printed surround and I know they would try to get as much of it filled... especially photographers where bigger is better (where as written and mainly text zines can become too crowded easily).
Its great work and art but you really missed a trick by not filling those pages with your work.
Sorry for the harsh criticism but I like to be honest and I did feel somewhat let down.
Anyway. Thanks for seeing this through and getting it out. The work included is very good and I liked and related alot to what I could see you were expressing in your work.
Cheers..",2

I wish much success to this CALpers campaign endeavor as we were in RI in acheving our established goal, since we were fortunate to be the first state in the country to get a forensic investigation done through crowdfunding by Ted. And for the first time we, the pensioners, had a report that exposed investment dealings that has been kept secret from us--the contributors of the RI State Pension ...secrets kept from us by the ex-fiduciary now governor Raimondo.
With her ""still in place"" very low rate of return (significantly below benchmark) investments and now w/her successor, the new Treasurer, Seth Magaziner, still keeping those fixed 10 year term equity, real estate & hedgefund poor performance investments in place, we, RI pensioners can now see for ourselves through Ted's forensic analysis investigation why we need the SEC, the IRS, the federal AG and other federal entities to investigate her dealings since Gov Raimondo has never been transparent and has been protective of Wall St rather than be protective of her RI citizenry. Hopefully your successful CALpers analysis will bring about changes if need be, since I don't see that ever happening in RI. Good luck to this CALpers Investigation",1

These are the rates for additional pins:

Hi,
Sorry I'm still a bit confused. I am pledged as an early backer. If I also want to get the First Collection pins I should NOT pledge an extra $9? I should wait till the Kickstarter ends and on the survey you will have an option for us to choose the First Collection pins? Or is it the other way around?
DanaCreator
5 months ago
No you shouldn't. The first collection is not part of this kickstarter, any funds you add for this kickstarter will only be used for these pins. I am simply giving people the option to purchase the pins from the first collection AFTER the kickstarter ends to have combined shipping but kickstarter rates and pledges won't apply for the first collection.

A stretch goal idea: print in two sizes, the size you are already doing, and a petite size (Maybe 1 1/2”?) available too. Everyone gets at 4 petite size stickers, at the stretch goal amount, and backers can add sets of 10 for $X amount per set.
It allows the design to stay the same, while giving people more options, and we might up our pledges to add in the petite sets! 😘

Hey Blake, thanks so much for checking in. Things are going great, albeit recording has taken a little longer than we anticipated. It has been a real labor of love though. We have spent a lot of time experimenting and getting everything to sound just right. And furthermore we definitely couldn't have given the album this much attention without you and everyone's support. We're very excited for it all to be done and for our friends and fans to hear it. We are actually heading into the studio tonight to begin our first mixing session. Should be a lot of fun.
We'll try to keep you posted as much as we can, but feel free drop in again any time and ask us how we're doing.
OH, and if you haven't seen this yet, here is a video we uploaded of us in the studio. It contains a bit of a new song called ""An American In Brooklyn."" ENJOY!

Hi HCTM staff,
I completed the survey and didn't have any problems with viewing or interacting with it.
However, for those that have had problems, besides clearing the browser cache, and enabling cookies (as you already suggested), other things that can be done to solve this problem include:
1) Disabling any Pop-Up Blocker that is preventing user from opening/viewing the survey.
2) Reduce Security settings to ""Low"" on their computer to enable them to open the survey.
3) Turn off their Firewall protection long enough to open the survey. The Firewall is within their security settings on their computer- go into Window's Security on their computer to disable. Remind them to remember to re-enable their Firewall when they are finished!!
4) If using an Apple computer, the user may need to Reset Safari. To do this, the user must click on ""Safari"" in the top menu bar, then click ""Reset Safari"" from the drop down menu. Now they can log back into their e-mail account and try to open the survey again.
Hope this helps!

Hey everyone it looks like one week to go. I know its tough times and everyone has more than likely given what they could but keep in mind that you can add a little more to your pledge and still keep the same gift that you chose. If we all find that we can scrounge for change in the couch or behind the car seat maybe we can add $10 or $20 to what each of us had pledged. Imagine if we all bumped another $20 we would make a noticeable impact. Let's try and make this week count. Let's make that final push for such a great band. :)

During the 70’s he sang for the Shahs of Iran. Only him, his tabla player and maybe another person allowed to perform. The King & Queen were very much entertained. When they were departuring from Iran an interviewer from an Iranian television asked Ahmad Zahir to stay for another week. During this week he may have gotten filmed or something. The company name of that particular Iranian Co is mentioned on YouTube by his Tabla player.",6

I have logged a complaint with Kickstarter. If everyone does the same, we might get our money back!

You will not get your money back according to Kickstarter due to the creator's death.

Will there be any more progress created for this?, will get our money back?, or will it just sit here?

@Lynn I do wonder if there is someone in the estate that will take over. I am presuming this was already made. There are pictures of it on his facebook page.

@Heather Williams, I had been wondering about what had happened to the project, but had just assumed that, like many KickStarter projects, it was just running extremely late. I am so sorry to hear the true reason there have been no updates.

I would imagine we will not be getting out product.
Rest In Peace MICHAEL HUDSON: I'm so saddened at the unexpected loss of Michael R. Hudson on July 8th, 2016. We had known each other for years and shared much in common including our love of Edgar Rice Burroughs, Frazetta, old pulp magazines, etc. I had served as an occasional consultant to him in his ReelArt Studios and Sequential Pulp projects. I last saw him in February, 2016 at Rich Harvey and Audrey Parente's Pulp AdventureCon in Ft. Lauderdale where Michael and I were planning new Frank Frazetta and Wallace Wood sculpture projects. The loss of Michael, like Herb Trimpe not too long before, reinforces my desire to be kind to everyone — as we may never get to see them again.

Hello! I hope the project is going well. I am inquiring on shipping estimate. I just want to verify that you have not submitted a survey yet for address information.
Thanks!

I'm truly happy for the success of your project and I'm glad to have been a part of making that happen. Now, go keep those Martians happy please. I shudder to think what would happen otherwise! - Mary Ann Back

I want to heartily thank everyone publicly who backed this project! Every penny given was needed and a huge blessing to me in getting this book printed.
This being our first book apart from Dark Horse Comics I know I have some huge shoes to fill as a publisher. I do believe that I chosen the right printer based on their incredible long term relationship with both DC and Marvel. That being said, I expect no drop off in the quality of our books from the ones Dark Horse was putting out under the Sequential Pulp Comics Imprint.
This project began in 2008 and YOU have made it a reality. gosh, it is a dream come true! As I gather information to prepare to send out premiums here is what I am going to ask that you do If you will and can. Here is the Diamond PREVIEWS June solicitation information.
June PREVIEWS Item Code: JUN161727 Release Date: 08/31/16 SRP: $19.99 Hardback
Please call your local comic book store just as soon as you can and ask them if they will carry at least one copy of the book. Give them the information above so they will not have to hunt it down in their massive catalog. I KNOW this is asking a lot of you but it will make a huge impact on Sequential Pulp being able to continue to publish books if we have good sales on Fredric Brown's Martians, Go Home. You've brought us this far and this would be the icing on the cake for Lowell Isaac, David Hopkins and me.
You can expect to hear from me soon regarding your premium.
Thanks again!—
Michael

Bravo Phil pour un merveilleux projet cinéma dont je sais déjà s'avèrera et connaîtra UN BEAU SUCCÈS comme toujours! Bien content d'avoir pu y apporter ma modeste contribution. Bon tournage dans le cadre du CMA 2019! P.S. Je te donne des nouvelles récentes d'une bien bonne et très généreuse amie à toi, notre grande comédienne acadienne VIOLA LÉGER… à qui j'ai rendu visite le 29 juin dernier, à l'occasion de son 89e anniversaire de naissance. Au cours des 12 années pendant lesquelles j'ai eu le bonheur de m'occuper de ses nombreuses archives, etc., elle m'aura souvent parlé de toi. Très hâte de visionner de fameux documentaire acadien.
