A project so ambitious and passionate is not easy to finance. This documentary absolutely fills both of those categories. Give the trailer a watch - or three - and get a peek at just how beautiful this film is in both essence and execution. If it moved you, please fund my friends; they dedicate hours of their day, nearly every day, just to make others happy. More importantly, contribute to Adrian's story. A donation of any size would mean the world to him.
Just three days to go - it's up to you to make this a reality. I'm hopeful. Spare yourself a few trips to the coffee shop and spread some love instead.

Miles I’m sorry I’m a bit confused, why does this Kickstarter only come to me if the other Kickstarter is successful? I’ve backed all your stuff before and have never been disappointed with your work but the way you’ve approached this Kickstarter is honesty disheartening.

Do not worry that is not what is happening - Puc the Artist is going to be printed no matter what. I am not sure if you read the digital copy I released, but it's a huge chunk of the story, there is a ton of work done on this book. After we made the call to make it more then 66 pages, it was going to take a bit more time to get done. This year has been crazy for me, and I am sure many, and when it getting around time to print the book it became clearly to me it was going to save me a ton of money and hassle to print it at the same time as ATGR. That does not mean it only gets printed if ATGR does well. I will still print it if it should fail. It's just with not being able to work, and there not being comic cons I have very little income this year. Saving around $3000 printing them together is something I just have to do if I can. I understand it makes the wait longer, and that sucks. I want the book out too, Garret and I are dying to share this story. But please don't worry, you will get your book and you will be getting way more pages then you paid for I promise

It's fascinating to go back through Kickstarters that didn't quite pan out, although at least this one got made.
Another backer who never got the DVD -- but did catch it on Netflix, and this has reminded me to download a copy. Can live with that. Thought it was a decent, eclectic watch that covered some of the history I wasn't expecting.

It's now 2019. Can we get a detailed update on the signed posters, or, failing that, a refund of the difference in pledge costs?
Cult Screenings UK LtdCreator
over 2 years ago
Scammed is a very serious accusation.
The doc was made and released and has got amazing reviews - we released a doc that far surpasses what we intended to make.
As for the posters:
- they were made and signed by Tom when we were in LA shooting the doc
- we then had them signed by graham in the U.K. a couple of months later when we attended a show with him
- we were told they bad been shipped by a member of our team who was tasked with shipping the perks
- it soon became apparent that they had not and the member of the team was removed
- we investigated but as the posters never appeared on eBay or other selling sites it was hard to prove what had happened to them other than ‘getting lost’
- we decided to produce a limited edition poster with a signed foil sticker which would be better than the original poster
- these were sent to graham first (as we are U.K. based) and he returned them in June this year
- as we were going to LA in July we decided to take them direct to Tom and arranged to meet him (as we do every year)
- when we got to LA Tom had to leave on business and we left them with our LA contact who is a well known doc producer
- Tom agreed to resign and we are awaiting them to be signed
We are aware that this has taken a hell of a time and is unfair on those who have supported us - we can assure you that we are not scamming anyone and to suggest that would mean that we took money and pocketed it which is theft and is an extremely serious accusation to make in a public forum.
Please be patient for a little longer - we will continue to push and get them signed and shipped ASAP!
Gareth-Michael Skarka
over 2 years ago
I'm willing to give you guys the benefit of the doubt on this.
But the silence when asked via emails, facebook, etc. REALLY does not help. Plus the whole ""removing"" of the team member -- you haven't asked him to turn over the posters? Have you gone to the authorities? Because that IS theft -- seems like you'd want to recover your property.
Can you give us details on the new ""limited edition"" version? Size, etc.?
Philip Clements

A post from May 5th on the Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/frightnightdoc/posts/2067543913318326
""It has come to our attention that the signed posters from the Kickstarter haven’t arrived with pledgers despite the campaign being over 2 years ago!
We sincerely apologise for this and it seems that there has been a mix-up somewhere with the personnel who ‘managed’ our rewards.
We are confident that all tees and blu-rays arrived. We now handle all rewards and orders personally!
We’ll get a new batch of foiled autograph stickers sent to Tom to sign in the next few weeks after we see Graham on May 19th.
Apologies again and we’ll update on here when we ship them.""

Watched it last night and really enjoyed it. Great work everyone, fabulous doco. It's a shame about the frame-rate snafu, but still an amazing release.

Just asking if the posters shipping at the same time as the dvds?

I am hand inserting signatures at backer request, so that takes a little time. Your package will definitely go out this week though, sans coin.
We are still having issues with the coin, but there's a resolution on the horizon. Expect an update on that within the next couple of days!

Hi! Just wanted to let you know that I love my Sketch Wallet! The packaging was so beautiful that I’ve repurposed it to hold some postcard sized watercolour paper I cut. It’s the perfect size for my handbag and it looks and feels wonderful to use! I am currently attempting to make a couple of watercolour journals from Arches and Fabriano Artistico to fit in my Sketch Wallet so I can use it to paint in on the go. I’m so glad I opted for the Tahoe Blue colour. It makes me happy every time I get it out to sketch. Well done!
Ralph ThomasCreator

Thanks Nicole! That made my day. You may be interested in my latest post. I found some amazing watercolor and multimedia paper that fits the original size 2.0 wallets. I believe you got that size so it would work for your wallet. But, I always love to see artists make custom books for their wallet :-)

Seraph HowesSuperbacker

Has the quality of the blank sketchbooks changed? Besides the front not being embossed the paper seems thinner than the one I received as a single with the wallet.
Otherwise the wallet is beautiful and tons of space, I’ve already had a few friends see it and want one of their own. The toned paper sketchbooks are also really nice.
Will lined and gridded sketchbooks become available for the large size wallet at some point?
Ralph ThomasCreator
about 2 months ago
Hello! The quality of the paper should be the same but if the covers are smooth laminated it means you received the previous version by mistake. All the original size covers should be an embossed synthetic material. We're happy to send you out the correct ones if you like. Thanks for the kind words and sharing out product with others. We're currently trying to figure out UK distribution so you can get our stuff faster and cheaper shipping. Lined books may be awhile before we are back in stock but the original size has lots of books that fit that size. Moleskine Cahiers are a good option.

Backerkit says: tracking numbers are automatically added to each backer’s survey. That doesn't sound like they're going to email the numbers but if you keep your survey link you can log in and check it.

I've got a lot of the books packaged and ready to ship in my house! They'll be starting to go out next week, once I'm back from San Diego Comic-Con. I'll do a proper Kickstarter Update once they are starting to go out so you know for sure. The backers with commission rewards will be slowly going out, as I'll be mailing them as I finish the artwork.

Read my volume Thursday night in one sitting. I knew the art would be great,obviously, but i was so impressed by the writing. I buy a lot of self published/indie/kickstarter books, and unfortunately the writing is often not the best. This was excellent, from dialogue to story beats to pacing. Just wanted to say great job and I'm looking forward to the next volume!

Speaking of, these titles will look fantastic alongside my signed Crossed hardcovers, signed Black Summer and No Hero, and of course my signed Neonomicon Hornbook.
