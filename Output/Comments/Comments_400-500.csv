Thank you, Jude! for your wishes and thoughts about the film. And thank you for sending the project out to your community! As you so articulately express, we do hope the film gives viewers an ""in"" to dance, an access point, a sense of familiarity. We're indebted for your support!

Congrats Maia and Lise on reaching your goal. So excited to see the film and hope others too join me in getting to all your ""reach goals""! As an ex-dancer, career documentary filmmaker and longtime Gyrotonic teacher myself, I know in my bones, heart and gut that powerful filmmaking can demystify movement. Your film has the potential to help people who don't ""understand"" or who feel inhibited, even afraid of moving, see and viscerally ""get"" what it means to break down movement and (right up my alley therefore) motivates learning too! Baryshnikov's thoughts feel so pertinent in this regard. Wishing you tons o'luck. Oh, btw, I shared your KS with the Gyrotonic community, so word just went to over 4,000 people in one big swoop. Now there's another portion of your ""niche"" audience who will watch when the film gets out :-)",10

Hi Dominik. Thank you for the question. There are actually great benefits for the airlines including financial and environmental benefits. And the main criterion for having a layover eliminated is that the itinerary has both a layover and a final destination that are located in hub cities. That puts approximately 53 airports in play located in 42 distinct metropolitan areas. I don't know if that will make it common, but I believe the system will benefit a significant number of travelers.

Karen - Thank you for sharing. It is powerful to see the statistics on educating women and the myriad benefits that come from it: greater financial security for the woman and her family, greater self esteem, independence and empowerment, lower average number of children, and as Paul Hawken's book Drawdown states coupled with family planning it is the single greatest path to reducing our footprint on the planet over ANY other carbon reducing initiative.
Terry Spahr, Executive Producer
Karen Gaia Pitts

Drawdown.org says that girls education is equally important to family planning. I think it is more important.
We educate girls in a pastoral community in Tanzania. Child marriage is common. Educating girls will allow them to escape early marriage or early pregnancy, which will, in turn lower fertility rates. ""If there is no reduction in child marriage, the global number of women married as children will reach 1.2 billion by 2050"" https://www.girlsnotbrides.org/where-does-it-happen/ . The difference between 0 years of schooling and 12 years is almost 4 to 5 children per woman. https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2016/02/16/climate-change-fertility-and-girls-education/ . There are many barriers to education but they can be overcome.
Terry SpahrCreator

Terrence we appreciate your comment below. We have heard that comment before that you could squeeze all 7.5 billion of us standing side by side in Texas. But what do we do about food? Do we eat the person next to us? We currently use land the size of South America for cultivating crops and land the size of the African continent to graze animals to feed our numbers.
Where do we live and sleep? Currently all the World’s housing would cover the entire surface area of your country Australia.
And what about the oceans? We can’t live there, but we sure have done a great job destroying them to feed all of us. 90% of fisheries are fished to capacity, overfished or in collapse and there is no end in sight to the demand on everything.
You suggest sustainable farming and permaculture which are admirable goals. We spent time filming this summer at the Land Institute in Salina Kansas, a leader in developing permaculture practices. Permaculture represents 1/100 of 1% of all the worlds farming and if the world’s farmers converted to permaculture to feed 7.5 billion people we would need to deforest and convert another South American sized continent to sustain us because for better or worse our current system is so juiced with fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides and water drawn from rapidly depleting aquifers to maximize the yield per acre that converting to a natural system would cause mass starvation and or mass destruction of the environment.
And Terrence we shouldn’t be afraid of addressing population honestly. Countries that have done so with their citizen’s support have found it a win-win proposition. When fertility rates decline, maternal and child health improve, food security increases, poverty decreases, savings and investment increase, education and economic opportunities expand, and productivity rises. Best of all the entire natural environment in these countries rebounded and thrived.
I think you will find our film compassionate, honest, sensible and uplifting.
Sincerely
Terry Spahr, Executive Producer

Kim RazzelCollaborator

Hey, Matthew. Kim here from Cat's team. Cat's recommendation is to get a normal frame with glass, even though it blocks out the UV and makes it glow less. To compensate, get a UV torch to charge it when you want it to glow.

Hello Adam, We will be using Aus post for our Aussie backers, however because of the book size we will be able to ship them as 'large letters' which is fantastic as it will save us a few bucks each time on shipping.
If it is more convenient for you to put down your parcel locker, please do so and we will just make sure your book is sent via the parcel post instead :) There will be a few other people who do the same and we are happy to accommodate.

I have a couple of questions.
1. When you say ""2 packs with 6 different stickers in each"" Does that mean we will get 12 unique stickers in all?
2. What will the original water color be? Will it be a print or an actual copy? Will each be unique?
Eduardo FrutosCreator

Hi! first.. Thank you for your support!!
1. I have upgrade de packs and they will have 7 stickers... the two packs have the same stickers, each one with the same 7 different designs.
2. The Watercolor is an unique handmade watercolor and ink paint of some Lovecraft mythos creature (drawn in my style) .. do you have any preference?

THRILLED to be one of only a few Collectors Edition backers! I truly hope you gain enough subscribers to make this a viable business. As a subscription box person, I've been highly disappointed at the offerings out there, especially Horror Block, with FAR too many in house trinkets! And they call them ""Exclusive""...just another way of saying cheap, because we don't want to get licensed merchandise. :( And their customer service is horrible. As a Canadian company, we should be paying in Canadian funds here in Canada, but are actually charged MORE than our US friends! I can't wait to unsubscribe from them & Loot Crate, so THANK YOU for giving us Horror fans a box that we can be proud of! (I'm keeping Bark Box though...my dogs would eat me alive if I cancelled that one...lol!)

Hello Victoria, Congratulations on attaining your kickstarter goal. I'm really looking forward to listening to your new album. My name is Deane LeBet, I heard you play onstage at the Colorado Renaissance Festival. I really enjoyed it. Also had the opportunity to meet you while you were playing on the street. I was the goof ball who said I'll give you five dollars if you give me a kiss, I'll give you five dollars if you show me your leg. You were a very good sport about it. I hope you'll be back in Colorado again next year. Once again congratulations, can't wait to help fund your next project. Deane.

Scrolling down on your home page here, under the heading of ""Other Ways You Can Help"", there is the suggestion to like your FaceBook page. The link is misleading, clicking on it brings one to https://www.facebook.com/manicpixiedreamwife which does not seem very Lovecraftian.

A suggestion - it would be cool to be able to see a full list of adopted words. To familiarise with the words, which someone somewhere deemed especially interesting and valuable
Erin McKean of WordnikCreator
over 5 years ago
Hi Heesung Yang! Thanks so much for your kind comment!
I would suggest using the ""Related"" section of the page to help you find your words! For instance, look up a word you like (such as 'book') and scroll down to the ""reverse dictionary"" section. There you will find a lot of interesting words, like 'exemplary' and 'adventurer' (and more obscure ones such as 'antiphonary' and 'vignette'). You can do the same with the rhyming words section -- choose a word you like the sound of, and see what other words share that sound!
I hope this helps!
Heesung YangSuperbacker

Glad this project made it! The saying goes, the more you learn the more you realize how little you know. Much more to learn for me, as a non-native English speaker myself.
I am trying to choose the right word to adopt, preferably a word not used that often. Other than using the ""random word"" feature in wordnik, what other ways would you suggest?

I learn my English through all my life - one little bit at a time, therefore I hold a very special place in my heart for different dictionaries - they are old and trusty friends. A shame what I learned about Wordnik only now, from a random search at Kickstarter, but it is better than never :)
Thanks for your wonderful work and good luck with a million new words - looking forward learning them :)

I found this Kickstarter through the article about you and Wordnik in the NYTimes. I hope the exposure gets the project to its goal...and far above it.
I LOVE words, from archaic to recently invented to totally made up by children. Word games, plays on words, words that EXACTLY define an occasion, feeling or occurrence.
Now that I know about Wordnik.com, I will be a frequent visitor. I hope you ARE able to add the million missing words. Good luck with the campaign!

Hi Tom,
sorry to bother in such a time, but I think I may have a problem with my order.
Backerkit says that it was shipped (most probably) on November 11th, but I still don't have received anything. Do you have a tracking code or some other method to track the package?
Thanks,
Hope Katie feels better ad both of you are safe
Katie WhittleCreatorSuperbacker
3 months ago
Hi Hika,
I just checked on this for you on Katies's postage account. Your order was marked as despatched on 11th of Novemeber as this is when it was packaged by Katie with the intent of sending it out either that or the next day. Unfortunately this was shortly before Katie fell ill resulting in it being left until I resumed sending out the orders.
I ended up sending your order out on the 27th of November so hopefully it will be with you in not too long. Royal Mail unfortunately doesn't offer tracking at the rates that we had to use to keep postage at a reasonable price. I'm sorry about the confusion and please let me know if it still hasn't got there after a week or two.
Hope this helps and this message finds you well,
Tom

Hi Katie,
I just checked my backerkit survey and it shows that my order hasn’t shipped yet. That’s okay! My original shipping address was to Myanmar and I know its tough to get items there. I ended up getting a last minute relief flight home to the USA and was wondering if it would be easier for you to ship my order to Texas. I know the shipping details are already locked so its no problem if the item is already in transit. Just wanted to see if it would make this process easier and faster for you.
I hope you are feeling better and your health has improved. Wishing you a happy holiday season. Can’t wait to get these items!
Katie WhittleCreatorSuperbacker

Hi Daniel,
This is Tom, Katie's partner I'm handling this account while Katie is recovering after her hospital visit. It would definitely be easier so send your package to Texas. If you send us a direct message on here with your updated address, email and phone number I will make sure to amend your address when I send out your parcel.
Katie is doing a little better and is home from hospital, however she will be recovering at home for a good while. Until then I will be handling order fulfilment to the best of my abilities.
Kind reagards,
Tom

I love these pins and I will be getting 3. I was going to order the Turkey Vulture, but it just occurred to me that the color on the wings is incorrect. They do not have brown feathers on the underside of their wings. They are white and black! By any chance can you correct this? Then I would definitely get the TUVU... one of my favorite birds!
Nathaniel MannsCreator
over 2 years ago
Hey! Ack! you're right! I was going more off the colors I see when they're against a blue sky (darker browns) versus their actual colors. I'm going to post up an alternative both to Backers and on my Twitter to see what people thing. I strive to do accurate, but still artistic designs, so this was definitely an oversight on my part! Thanks for pointing it out and I'll get everyone's opinions on the change of color very soon!!!

@Aria: Thank you for bringing this up this concern. We will be ordering the pins within these 1-2 days so this means that the pins will be under production very soon. I can’t guarantee when exactly the pins will arrive my place and be sent out due to current pandemic, however I am hoping that the pins can arrive to my place in late October so that we will be able to pack and send them out in early November. We hope that everything goes as smooth as it can but we will update you guys if there’s any problems with the manufacturer or shipping. We all know Miss Corona loves playing games.
