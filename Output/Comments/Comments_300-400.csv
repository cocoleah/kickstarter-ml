This is one of the strangest projects I backed on kickstarter - regarding comments or backer participation. Almost like a ghost town.
So, May has passed, there were no updates during the whole project - where do we stand? When will the CD ship?

FaraiyaSuperbacker

I got my copy today! Looks absolutely beautiful, but my slipcase has a tiny misprint: the spot gloss on the eyes has been printed about 1cm too low, so they're misaligned with the actual eyes. It's fine on the book itself, though.

Ooh Corn Pops haven't had those in ages, though i liked those with milk only >.< I am with you @Sarah, i love my milk a lot XP. My favorite cereal to eat without milk would have to be any type of captain crunch LOL XD

@Julie I'm sure most avocado lovers would lol I actually don't like avocados that much lol
Most fruits and veggies we buy at the store have tons of varieties only the easiest to ship and grow make it to stores though. Like I didn't know there was more than one type of pineapple. I planted a field of white pineapple. It was my favorite fruit and I actually do not like pineapple from the store. Pineapple doesn't sweeten after it gets picked, only softens and they pick them early for easy shipping and customer appeal (they get yummy brown, sugar spots inside when ripe and people think it is ugly) lol

@Julie - I was wondering about what looked like a horn, but I wasn't sure. So yes, I am very very excited for us to unlock her!! Even if purple isn't my favorite color. She's tooo cuute!!

@Jessica Don't be! haha, I do watch my friends play Overwatch on Twitch. Who do you like?
and yes!!! I finally found dry cereal friend!!! lol I used to munch Corn Pops a lot, straight out of a box ;p
NyakoZhovurSuperbacker

@Julie sorry for the late response, I have been playing a lot of destiny 2 and overwatch lol.
Yes I do like eating my cereal dry, but it has to be a certain kind lol; i am a very picky eater XP. Though I do love me some milk XD. I just recently tried the Apple Cinnamon Toast Crunch, holy moly was that delicious; i am pretty sure i ate the whole box in 2 days LOL.
I had no idea there was eight different types of avocado; my mother would get a kick out that! she loves them, she just recently finally got me to try one LOL.
AHHHH WE MOST UNLOCK THAT UNICORN! It looks amazing <3. I want it >.<

I'm pleased to back this project as a gift for my mother, Gladys Miller. At 86, she has finally stopped weaving but has been an accomplished Navajo weaver and teacher for the past 40 years. She learned to weave from Mae Jim of Two Grey Hills in the 70's and used many of Mae's techniques in her work. She dyed her own wool using natural dyes and taught Navajo weaving at Ghost Ranch in Abiquiu, NM for 20 years. She will love this project.",2

Hello, again, I still haven`t received the T-Shirt, I`m sure its on the way, but I must go in vacations now, and will be back in two weeks, if the Customs get it now, it will be sent back to you again !!!
By the way I also looked at my Mail box, and its writen JC Laurent on it, exactly like I wrote it for you to send the package, so its even stranger that it didn`t comme the first time.....
Anyway lets hope for the best, and I will tell you in January if I got it or not.

This is just the kind of project our motorcycle community needs! If it isn't for documentaries like this, we'll be stuck with the never-ending stream of sub-par content that the big-time media folks throw at us. We deserve better, and the only way to make it happen is thru grass-roots projects like this. Thanks for all the work in documenting this great story & culture!
I can't wait to get my digital download and enjoy it with some friends after a good day's ride. Best of luck, Chris!",6

I have been very patient and I am fully happy to wait as I'm sure it's a huge undertaking for one person but I need to know what's going on. I have tried to reach out in insta, Kickstarter and Etsy. After the last communication being that she had put mine in the mail and I still hadn't got them like a month later (I forgot about them) I finally got ahold of her. She mentioned that this happened to someone else as well and she would have to redo the drawing so to give her a few days. That's totally okay. I get that. But I still have heard nothing and it's been about another month and I cannot get contact. I am officially reporting this Kickstarter which is a huge bummer. I have the deck and pins but never did get any of my prints. That I Paid $108 for! Very sad. :(

Hi Bekka, thank you for sharing your story and I'm sorry that you've gone through this.
There seemed to have been 10 backers that opted for the custom drawing, 5 in the $75 tier and 5 in the $100 tier (I'm in that last tier). I'm also very sadden for the $108 expense (the most I've ever spent on a tarot deck) but more so than the expense, is the complete lack of communication that really hurt.
It looks like at least three of us have not received the custom drawing and I have no idea what the other 7 got, if anything at all.
I wished there was a way to notify the community alas, we can only hope that things will eventually turn around or fade away.
As usual, I'm writing today's date because the posts don't show an actual date so for anyone looking back here from the future and needs to follow the timeline of events:

Hi Addison,
I can copy/paste what Sara said below as it is true for me as well:
Please can you contact me. I still haven’t received my custom drawing and extra prints. I have sent several direct messages to you about this as well. It would be so reassuring to hear from you 🌸

Has Addison ever contacted you back? I've also been missing the custom drawing and prints and I haven't heard a single response since January 2nd, 2020 (today is April 9th, 2020)
Sara YearsleySuperbacker

Hi Alex,
Addison has not responded to me directly since January 3rd. In that message she said she had just posted the drawing to me: 'I promise that your prints and drawings were not forgotten! I actually sent them out today in a protected envelope (your two extra prints included!)'
Addison also told me a month earlier that she had posted the drawing. In a message sent on December 6th, she said 'I finally was able to send everything out a couple of days ago! I wanted to message you to let you know that your drawing will arrive in an envelope separate from your deck and other rewards.'
I have to admit, I have found this experience heartbreaking. Personally, it was a huge financial investment to increase my pledge to purchase an original drawing and I feel so badly let down. I am at a loss for what else to do.
I am so sorry you have also had the same experience. x
AlexSuperbacker

Hi Sara,
I have had a very similar experience with the messaging:
The January 2nd message said ""Your drawing and prints should be arriving soon! I sent them out today!""
and back in December 6th the message said ""I finally was able to send out everything a couple of days ago. I also wanted to let you know that your drawing and prints will arrive in an envelope separate from your deck and other rewards.""
The reward tier I pledged for was the ""Deck + Drawing + Extra"" which promised the following:
Tarot Cards and Box (signed)
Custom Drawing
Tarot Guidebook
4x6"" Print
5x7"" Print
8x10"" Print
2× Visionary Pin
Extras
I received a regular tarot deck (NOT signed)
the guidebook
the two pins
and the extras for stretch goals
I've even reach out to her about the unsigned tarot deck and she offered to exchange it after I shipped the one I got back to her. I had told her at the time that I would wait for the rest of the stuff first and then make up my mind about it (all of these messages about the signed deck were made around mid December 2019).
I am so disappointed in this experience and I feel sad and taken advantage of. This was the first time that I went the extra mile to get a custom drawing (I've never done that before) and I was truly excited for this.
I am also very sorry that you had to go through this. If Addison would not have just completely dropped the ball on the communication (both over the Etsy store thing AND for these custom drawings) I feel it would have helped, at least a little, in feeling like we're not being ignored or being taken advantage of, or being let down.
Thank you for sharing your experience, Sara. I am very sorry that you went through this.
I also do not know what else to do. She has logged in several times since January 3rd but has not responded to any message. I remember a January 10th, January 27th, sometime in February (can't remember the date) and March 6th. These were the dates as ""Last Login"" and although I can totally understand that life happens and people lose track of things, I have reached out to her a couple of times via direct email as well as kickstarter messages and nothing has produced a single reply.
All I can say is that I'm writing all of this information here for posterity for anyone that comes back in the future or if Addison creates a new project and those backers wish to see a previous project's Comment section.

Hi, Addison!
Never told you; but I received the pin and I loved it. Using it a lot.
Also, I was super thrilled and humbled when reading your thoughtful note. It is marvelous to see the creators of stuff I love know and enjoy my own creations. What a beautiful life!
Thanks for everything. May you have happiness and success!

Hello Community!
I've been trying to contact the creator due to missing items from my pledge and I have not heard from her either via KS messages or via her direct email.
Is anyone able to reach out to her? I'm not sure how to move forward at the moment. If you have a contact, feel free to send it my way or if you are in communications with her, please let her know that a backer is trying to reach out.
If you have any other suggestions let me know!
Thank you!

Your passive aggressive comment is on point here. I do apologize for misspelling your name. I find it abhorrent when people do it to me. Gee, thanks for validating my feelings. I don’t back people or projects based on positivity and encouragement, or love and light. I back people on an expected outcome in a timely manner. When I am backer 137 then I expect to be the 137th person to receive the product. Thanks for your opinion and criticism. I learn everyday.

Thank you for working so hard. I've backed a lot of kickstarters and more than understand the possibility of delays. I felt personally that you had communicated all necessary information and the rest was much needed patience. You've done great, I love the decks and I hope you don't give up despite the people who were disgruntled.
Things happen and not a single person could ever say they haven't messed up or over estimated themselves. As my Christian friends love to say ""let he who has never sinned, cast the first stone."" <3
I appreciate the Work, Addie. So Thank you!

I'm frustrated by the lack of communication. I have messaged her here, on instagram, and now I've sent her an email too and I've heard nothing. Absolutely nothing. I did wait between sending messages too, giving her what I figure is enough time to respond. I get if she's stressed, but sending out etsy orders before sending out the kickstarters isn't cool. I'm still excited about getting the deck, but I'm frustrated that there's so little communication about what's going on.
MeganSuperbacker

Mackenzie- those decks should’ve been sent out within the week she received them. That’s what has happened with every other one-person operation I’ve dealt with on this forum. 7 days.
Mckenzie Nokomis
over 1 year ago
I'm assuming despite the misspelling this was a response to my comment.
What you believe should occur based on past experiences does not create guarantees. Not that your complaints are invalid though. Everyone has different expectations. I'm just a believer in encouragement and positivity rather than impatience and rage for something that implied possible delays in the very beginning as they all do here. That and I'm not going to die if I don't get a deck of cards in 7 days.
MeganSuperbacker

As a super backer, I have had MULTIPLE decks (4 at least) that I have backed and received after this one. I don’t mind a wait. I do mind IF THE ALLEGATIONS REGARDING ETSY are true. I might even ask for my money back if this is intact the case. You cannot fulfill Etsy orders without first supplying your backers, essentially investors, first. If this makes me a spoiled child because I’m concerned that my hard-earned teacher salary is being used to finance and back an Etsy shop FIRST, then I guess I am. Chance, I would shut your mouth before you piss off any more backers. There has been little information coming out of this creator, and now with these allegations, and just a quick reply because feelings are hurt, makes me reconsider backing this artist again. I look forward to a VERY THOROUGH AND RAPID response to these Etsy allegations before committing to one side or the other, and therefore taking appropriate action.

Considering she received the decks for the kickstarter in October, you've only waited 2 months so far for it to be shipped and 3 weeks since the last update. Just statin' some more facts ^_^

Besides, why accept even more preorders if you’re overwhelmed at trying to get the first batch of decks out to backers?
Crane SlaughterSuperbacker

Chance, you gotta understand here that you’re not helping your friend. Especially as you’re a second hand source of information calling people children and impatient while she remains quiet on the subject, but has taken down her Etsy store. I feel like six months is pretty patient and everyone is justifiably concerned but man, you’re just digging a hole deeper for your friend.

Well I could have ordered one off Etsy until yesterday. Now the shop seems to be on holiday. Curiouser and curiouser...

Hi J. First I just want to say thanks. I finally get to read the book and I can't wait to dive into it. I'm just wondering though. I backed for 15 dollars and got the reward tier with the two extra E-books: Ecksdot and Inklings. Just wondering when those will get sent out. Thanks, I know you're working hard to get everything done.

I was wondering when the paperbacks of Song of Locke will arrive. You see, I'm going to university in September and so Id really like it to arrive before then so I can take it to uni with me instead of asking my parents to send it up...

I enjoyed reading the chapters! The dynamic between Picke and Locke is entertaining; their conversations are fun to follow along with. The opening was very nostalgic for me, having played Ocarina of Time so often, and in general the writing style is quite fluid. Also, I think it's great that you have it divided into scrolls. It makes the story feel older, even gives it the sense of being a story in another world, not just about another world.
As a writer, I congratulate you and wish you the best of luck.
I look forward to reading the entire story with much enthusiasm!
