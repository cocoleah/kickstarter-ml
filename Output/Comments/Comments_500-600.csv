Question... Is there a way, either now or future, to upgrade from BOTH ($100 pledge) to DOWNLOAD ($120 pledge). I realize Kickstarter is over, and funds have been transferred. My bad, misread description (thought ""get all video"" meant get, not stream). I take full responsibility, and I'm sure the streaming will be awesome, just wondering if there is a possible protocol for this further in the process after you have completed the videos. Thank You

Hi Paul, I'm so excited that I get to have the next best thing to an in-person permaculture course, for just $120!!! After listening to the podcast about the course, I have a lot of confidence that it's going to be amazing. And question, if I do a design after listening to the recording, will it be too late to get feedback, will everyone in that forum have left b/c they attended/listened live? If there will be a deadline, could it possibly take into account us recording people? Also, you rock.

Paul, ""regular"" == ""decent"" in my books. Most folk seem to have ADSL capable of ~3Mbps uploads. That would be enough. So long as you don't have a cap on uploads it should be fine.
Only a couple of hours to go and the campaign is over 1,230% pledged — a fantastic level of support! I think your last update was right on the money: Do a PDC at home and (for some) get your design critiqued. I'm on the wrong continent to attend personally, but want the knowledge and this seems to have turned out to be a good way to get it. Really looking forward to the HD Downloads!

Timo,
It looks like you said ""if you have a bad internet connection"" and the solved it by having a good internet connection.
As for microphone stuff: daniel keeps oodles of microphones going all the time. So my guess is that there will be plenty of microphones.
Timo Pasanen
almost 4 years ago
One thing that I've noticed with lots (and lots, and lots) of recordings of presentations is that they use directional microphones on the cameras that are aimed at the speaker, or a lapel microphone. Whilst this makes the speaker's voice clearly audible, it makes it difficult/impossible for ""questions from the audience"" to be heard — and an answer/response is sometimes meaningless if you don't know what the question was. If you could address that issue it would be great! (Some speakers just repeat the question, which works. Other times it's clear a second omni-directional mic has been placed somewhere and the second audio track gets edited in. I've even seen a wireless mic that gets handed around the audience and you need to be holding the mic before you can ask a question.)

If bandwidth is a problem, then you could look into bundling each reward into a single, compressed file, encrypt them all, and then just turning them into torrents and seeding them from a single computer with a regular Internet connection (faster is nicer but it doesn't need to be special). As more and more people start downloading them, everyone's download rates will increase as the whole peer-to-peer magic kicks in. Email each backer with the set of passwords (decryption keys) that they are entitled to and... bandwidth problem solved! Instruct each backer to let you know once they have downloaded and decrypted all of their rewards. Once everyone who was entitled to a particular reward has downloaded it, stop seeding that reward. If you have a spare computer with a big hard drive, and a decent Internet connection, then this is almost a zero-cost way to distribute content.

@tanner - Thanks, it was in my junk mail. I had thought the email was simply signed as ""Phantom"", but he did include contact information.
tannerpid
over 4 years ago
@Brittany A, There was information included in the email that i posted regarding names and such, i didnt want to put it up here for the reason of prevention a witch hunt. The information was at the bottom of the email i received. I found the email in the junk of my inbox. I wont be posting it publicly
Brittany A.
over 4 years ago
@JEL - Thanks for the recommendation, the service looks infinitely better, though I’m not sure that’s saying much. Businesses which offer “lifetime” subscriptions are more liable for fulfilling what they advertised as opposed to KS offerings where they can legally let their project fall through at any time and walk away with our money.
Did anyone catch the name of the creator of this project? It would’ve been displayed under “Casper”. I’m not suggesting a witch hunt, I’m just curious if there was ever a verified individual tied to this project, or if the individual used a fake identity.
JELSuperbacker
over 4 years ago
I agree with @Brittany A. I was very leery about getting a new VPN ""lifetime"" subscription, but opted for PureVPN (Stacksocial has a lifetime subscription for fairly cheap). I decided to go for them since they have been around for about a decade. That's 10 times longer than VPNGhost/RogueVPN and it seems a lot more established. FU VPNGhost/RogueVPN.
Brittany A.
over 4 years ago
Thanks for posting that information guys. I'm not convinced that we should take every word of some guy named ""Phantom"" as truth after what just happened, but at least if offers an explanation. I had a feeling my subscription and private server wouldn't last ""a lifetime"", but for it to not even last a year and to have all of these constant technical issues is very disappointing. I doubt I got $60 worth of VPN service and I suspected something might be going wrong because the technical issues continued.
If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is. These creators seem far too comfortable with shrugging their shoulders, reneging on their promises and commitments within a year, deleting their KS account and not looking back. If I see another VPN service pop up on KS offering ""life time subscriptions"", I'll be writing a warning.
JELSuperbacker
over 4 years ago
Wow... thanks to @tannerpid for this information. That's so weird because I always felt Casper provided great service when I needed it. And in talking with him, I learned he quit his job to focus on VPNGhost... supposedly. Anyway, this really sucks... I guess I have to find a new VPN provider that will shut down due to in-fighting... this blows.
tannerpid
over 4 years ago
Phantom sent the following email to those who have not seen it ""I feel as though its only fair that I inform users why VPNGhost has dissolved. I was an original co founder of VPNGhost. When we started gaining lots of users, ""Casper"" decided that revenue is more important than UX. I did not agree, after a few arguments over the reliability of the service I was basically cut off my own website so I could not access any accounts or anything. I lost full control of the website and the outcome was the terrible money scam rogue vpn. I would like to personally appoligize to all users for any inconvience ""Casper"" may have caused you. It was beyond my control and if it were up to me the site would still be going at full functionality I left it with. The truth is, ""Casper"" is money hungry and never cared about the service or the users to begin with, even now. So my due dilligance is to share this with you.

VPNGhost switched to RougeVPN from which I was able to sign up and gain access to more keys as stated on the previous website however, the company seems to have gone dark, heh I guess you can say gone 'rouge' as the vpnghost.net website no longer exists and the website rougevpn.net is 'parked' which means either expired to listed for sale. Therefore no contact or way of understanding what is going on, RougeVPN twitter and facebook are both empty so it seems like the company is no more? I would like someone to shed some more light on this but I guess we are all in the dark about this.

JELSuperbacker
over 4 years ago
Bad news... we just got an announcement about a week ago saying that VPNGhost has been changed to RogueVPN, and apparently it's not the same people running things. Too bad, because VPNGhost has been awesome up until this point.
First of all, the RogueVPN website is absolutely terrible with the most support and information for the signup page only. When you're a member, the ""Dashboard"" or Client Area is so minimal, it looks like a mobile website.
Secondly, and perhaps the most concerning, is the fact that they have changed their policy on the Lifetime Private Server that some of us paid for. I was told by their customer support person (who was not very courteous at all, btw) that the Private Server expires in 2017. There is NOTHING during the Kickstarter campaign that indicated an expiration date... in fact, Casper responded to a question about the Private Server being a lifetime:
Janielle Guy: ""Would the private vpn server is also lifetime?""
Casper (who ran this campaign) : ""All packages come with our lifetime subscription.""
So there you have it, all of that money we paid doesn't amount to what we paid for. Not good. VPNGhost was excellent in every single way. RogueVPN is terrible. If you're reading this in lieu of a review, make sure that you know what you're paying for.

@Casper was very helpful in getting me up and running - thanks!!! Now that I have an idea of how this works, can I put in a request to add a public server to the West Coast of the US? Preferably Southern California? Or perhaps have my private server in Southern California? Thanks for delivering on an amazing KS project!!!

There's a couple of ways to do this! You can do the two pin pledge or add $15 to your pledge, which will translate to money to spend on addons in Backerkit, or you can leave your pledge as is and add on the other pin design within backerkit - that is probably the easiest and least expensive method :) This article probably explains better than I can!

First, thanks for your support. It means a lot to us here. With this being our first Kickstarter campaign, the response/ support/ love/ pledges we've received has been awesome. Receiving comments like yours is just the icing on the cake.
We have another Kickstarter dropping later this year for a series called The Gilded Age (http://johnrmcguire.com/the-gilded-age/), which I think you'll also enjoy. Have a great night, and thanks again for the support.

On my shipping, can you send/drop off my rewards at the TouchCast offices please? I'll be over in December and can collect then, avoiding the $50 shipping to the UK where I live!
Best of luck for the remaining $3,000 over the next 11 days.

Desmond - whoops this was an oversight - (too many moving pieces!) - it should have been listed as $50 for shipping international like the other levels. I just tried to change it but the system is locked once someone backs that level. Happy to arrange shipping separately with you and wish I had noticed sooner. Thanks for your kind words about the campaign - please tell your friends because we are only 51% funded at this point!

Hello, My name is Kristin Sanger, Executive Director for the Snake River Animal Shelter in Idaho Falls, ID. Our facility is the only nonprofit animal shelter serving all of the municipal shelters and community members in East Idaho in order to prevent euthanasia of healthy animals. When we were introduced to Home to Home in 2017 we knew that it would be an incredible tool in assisting us and all of the local shelters in the region with overcrowding. This program has proven itself time and time again as we refer pet owners to the Home to Home site and hep them find new homes for their animals in a short period of time. There is nothing more settling, when you have to make a tough decision to re-home a pet, than being able to find that just right new home yourself. Our shelter is a wonderful place with caring staff but we stand by ""There is no place like Home to Home.""

I'm the Executive Director of Valley Humane Society in Pleasanton, CA. We've been using this rehoming site for a few years now. It has proved to be a tremendous resource. This program has given people a safe and reliable way to find new homes for their beloved pets. The idea of anyone having to rehome their pets may seem hard for some to understand, but our experience has shown that these are not easy decisions and many are made in the best interest of the animal. This program is all about the animals. It helps them move from one loving home into another. Thank you for supporting this kickstarter campaign. This will allow the system to be updated and provide a greater service to the animals we are helping.",6

The best way to file a claim on a lost parcel is to contact us at the customer service email:
CUSTOMERSERVICE@STUDIOFOGLIO.COM
Let me know your current address and what your order was so I might check it against our records, and we'll track down your order or see if there was a payment issue, and if it needs replaced, we'll happily do so at no charge! The best way to let us know about a problem is by telling us about it, and unfortunately, leaving notes in the comments section of the campaign, we sometimes lose track of them. So, please toss an email at me in the Customer Service inbox, and we'll get right on it!
Thanks for your patience!

Hi there, folks! As Kaja is getting back on her feet after her illness, we're gearing up for the next volume's Kickstarter. Ergo, we need to wrap up the loose ends from 'Queens & Pirates' immediately - YAY! Huzza!
Recently - due to USPS's forced budget cuts & COVID'19 - we found that international shipments had gone to Rotterdam for International distribution not by plane, but instead... via the luggage rack atop a submersible, apparently. This would be awesome if we'd been informed and given each book order it's own hard hat dive gear & wet suit. But this is not what occurred.
What DID happen, is a handful of Scandinavians, French, German, Italian & perhaps an Australian or two were delivered Late Books; which is to say they arrived late, but were books no longer. What Customs did, in fact, forward to our backers was a plastic bag full of wet pulp with traces of what once had been a volume full of Adventure, Romance & MAD SCIENCE!
Huzza! They arrived... kinda.. sorta... not.. really. >___>;
SO! THIS IS A CALL TO THOSE OF YOU NOW IN POSSESSION OF GIRL GENIUS'S LIMITED COLLECTOR'S EDITION PAPER PULP &C.: IF YOU HAD DAMAGES AND HAVE (1.) ALREADY CONTACTED US ABOUT IT, (2.) HAVE YET TO DO SO, OR (3.) ARE MISSING ANY ITEMS FROM YOUR 'QUEENS & PIRATES' ORDER, PLEASE EMAIL US AT: CUSTOMERSERVICE@STUDIOFOGLIO.COM
I NEED TO HEAR FROM YOU SO I HAVE YOU AND YOUR NEEDS AT THE TOP OF MY LIST! I WANT EVERYONE WHO HAS REPLACEMENT NEEDS HEARD.
• Due to COVID restrictions, Kaja & I are not able to operate within the Studio simultaneously, so I'm forced to work remotely while we communicate incessantly.
• Please note that we are prioritizing Paper Pulp People for hardcover replacements at this time. Our remaining stock is extremely limited, so we can not stress enough the need to be realistic about replacement needs.
• Replacement Orders will go out as fast as we can process them and have them picked up for delivery.
• Please note that USPS is still experiencing delays due to this Global Pandemic, and thus we can not promise expedited shipment, but we will be wrapping everything in plastic and trying to make sure the boxes are as safe as possible so that your order arrives safely. If the tracking times out, let us know and then maybe give it a week or two - we've found that the parcels do arrive eventually, if seemingly at random and after having had an adventure all their own. USPS has a backlog of parcels they're working on.
Thank you all for being the best reader base Studio Foglio could possibly ever ask for. You've been eternally patient with us & we thank you. Without your support, the adventures of the Lady Heterodyne & the rest of our gallant band would be lost to history; nothing but hushed whispers in a world hungry for more. You keep us on track, the gears greased, the encampment ticking off the seconds precisely.
From us to you, thank you. Now, I'm off to await your messages so I can make sure you get your orders.
Forward~ for Victory & the Postal System!
Ever your humble & obedient servant, &c., &c., &c...

Hi there folks. So, here's a bit of an unofficial update as I'm not in-studio due to COVID restrictions, so my informationis a day out of date: Kaja was temporarily hospitalized with a ""massive kidney infection"", hence why the GG mainpage hasn't been updated in a few days. This will inevitably slow up replacement shipments as Kaja was the one handling those in house. With her back at home and recovering, we're going to have to find a means of getting shipments out. Perhaps I can go in and try to have a no-contact shipment packaging day. We'll let you know as soon as we've managed. We're so incredibly sorry for this delay.

Gerhard,
We switched everything over to Zendesk. I hope I'm getting everyone's correspondence & vice versa. Anyway, no worries, we're working on shipping out replacements and the like, but due to COVID and budget cuts, USPS is experiencing delays and getting inventive with their shipping methods, so we're having to also work to accommodate these changes. We hope you see your parcel in the mail soon. You should receive a tracking number in the mail when it gets into the system. Thanks very much for your patience.

Note: We will take a look at damages on a case by case basis, but at this time we would ask that the hardcovers ideally be reserved for those whose books arrive in a condition that one might be hard pressed to identify as a book. Thank you for your understanding.

It seems that way. If everything is shipping Internationally via boat, and we were not aware of this sudden change in policy, then it's safe to assume that things got wet on the crossing. Even a dry crossing can see condensation build inside a container.
Again, if your book is damaged, then we can replace it, but be aware.. the hardbacks are extremely limited in number, so we are praying we don't have to replace any of them because we have very few left.
Remy Monsen

So, did all the books to Norway arrive wet? I made my comment on the update thread earlier, but I now see people here reporting the same thing here. Very long journey, additional plastic bag added by Norway post to protect the content of the very wet and falling apart envelope the book was shipped in. Fortunately the inner plastic bag seems to have protected the book adequately. Also noticed that the envelope of madness was also moist when I opened it.

To be fair, USPS is having one hell of a time right now. Last I saw, not only are 1000+ couriers sick with COVID and another 40+ dead, with their workload piling up and needing redistributed for sorting and processing, but Trump has a personal vendetta against them because he wants to sell the service to his private sector friends for personal gain, and as a result ordered the Federal Government to not fund our constitutionally protected postal service, which is exactly what happened when the recent bailout was issued. USPS didn't get a cent.
So, no.. they aren't hiring a plane because they can't afford it. I'm surprised they aren't using their UPS contracts to their fullest potential, but then.. maybe that's where the ship came from? You're right though.. they can do better even with what they have.

Gadgetman,
That's more information than they've been willing to give us, thank you! Now we know what to expect in future. We're looking into plastic protectors as I type this.
As to your order, is it in need of replacement, or is it a miraculous survivor of it's seafaring adventure?

My book was only slightly damp on the top edge, and has dried out with minimal issues. (slight wavyness) Not a problem for me, at least.

Mine also arrived today, and just like Tore's book, the envelope was wet and beginning to fall apart.
The outer plastic envelope was added by the Norwegian post, so the damage most likely happened while till in te clutches of the USPS.
Please note that the USPS is currently shipping anything destined for Europe on container ships instead of planes. (Not enough pasenger flights going across the atlantic, and they can't be arsed to rent a transport plane.... )
And they send one load every week, to one of Europe's busiest ports; Rotterdam...
Let's just say that Amazon uses DHL to ship from the USA to Europe. No option for anything cheaper right now.
Studio FoglioCreator

So very pleased to hear everyone is receiving their orders, but we are absolutely appalled to hear of the condition a very few have arrived in. We did not intend for the shipping to come by submarine by way of inlets, sounds, lochs & fjords. We're going to look into what precisely they got up to in their travels which might have seen them through the wars and back. We shall happily replace any of these heavily damaged goods. We want your reading experience to be pleasurable.. and dry.

Now that I am able to work on the film full time again, it is my objective to finish the remaining VFX shots in the next two months.

Work on the project slowed down for a few months during the summer, while I was working for WildBrain Studios creating VFX for the Carmen Sandiego series on Netflix. I learned a lot from that production, and am happy to say that I am hard at work applying my new effects skills to this project. I'm glad to be able to work full time on The Old Gods again, and every week its getting closer and closer to completion!

I would probably skip Carmen Sandiego, honestly. However, knowing that you worked on it, I am definitely going to check it out. I'm very happy for you. Also I wonder if you have been able to watch any of Lovecraft Country. I am now watching that on HBO Max. With your busy schedule I won't be too surprised if you don't get any free time, but I think you'd have a wonderful time watching it if you ever get an opportunity.

We regret to inform you of some very unfortunate news.
Our lead actor has just received news of a death in his family, and he feels that he must take a leave of absence.
We know that you have been eagerly awaiting the latest updates on our Nightgaunt project, but we must ask for your patience during this trying time. While our live action filming is postponed until our leading man returns, know that this is only a momentary break. We are very eager to continue production and we will bring the latest along the way.
Until then, fellow cultists

Hello to Scott Uhls and all our other awesome backers! Lots of people have been asking us how far Nightgaunts is into production. Its fair to say that progress has been slower this spring than we had originally planned. Most of our team members have been bogged down with school and work. Many of our team are international students and they have left the country for the summer to visit family. This of course means that those of us who remain are having to do a lot of multi tasking.
But rest assured friends, the diabolical work continues. With the support you guys have given us, we have been able to start collaborating with the legendary Monster FX artist Gideon Hay (known for X Men, Alien vs Predator, Slither). Our aim is to build ourselves some gruesome practical fx props of the Nightgaunts for our actors to interact with. As most of our team trained as 3D animators, this is new territory for us. There's a lot of learning and exploring going on. But its also very exciting.

Hello all. I wanted to say to all. What a top notch book this is. That issue two will be even better. I had an issue with shipping in my book. It was replaced with another one immediately.

Not only did he replace the damage book also put in additional material. I owe him a huge thank you. It will be my pleasure to help fund their next book.

This is my 1st Kickstarter so I still have things to learn. I will also send you the links to your two Jaded digital Issues. Then please post when everything is good how happy you are because I was born to make you happy! lol Just a joke but yes I need you to get what you paid for. Peace.

Second book in a week sent in a manila envelope media mail. I pay good money for a book expecting it to being in mint or near mint condition when it gets in my hands. Thanks. Good work on the inside.
Honestly don't want to sound as though creators don't try and put out good work. They can't ship worth a darn. Going cheap shipping makes your lifelong project cheap.

It's been nearly 2 years since this kickstarter succeeded. I never received my t-shirt pledge. What gives? No updates since May 2016. No updates about rewards being sent out.
Lame.

So, any updates on this? November has come, and gone :)

Hi Kent,
We have put the film through a few film festivals this year and are now about to make a few quick edits to the film to tighten it up a bit. At that point, we'll have it ready for private screenings as well as allow for digital downloads from backers. It might be a few more months from now, my best guess would be November! I'll let everyone know when the final edit process is complete!
Kent Kanstad

When will I be able to download this film? I've backed for a digital download, but I've heard nothing yet.
Robb JacobsonCreator

Hey Mark,
The only thing we're waiting on right now are the designs for the T-shirts to be finalized. The creator of the design is working on this for free, so she's needed to prioritize her work for a little bit. I'm meeting with her this week to talk about the designs again, and once we finalize them, we will get them printed, which might take another 2 weeks, and send them off.
The estimated delivery was created before we had a good idea of what the film's schedule would be. I thought as soon as we outputted the film for festival consideration, we'd have way more free time to work on the rewards, but there have been several procedural delays (color correction, additional sound editing, etc.).
I will send another update as soon as everything is ready to be delivered and will personally send you a notification.
Thanks for your support!
- Robb

Your estimated delivery was Jan 2016. You've missed that by four months already. Why the delay? Even telling us, 'We are waiting for orders to be processed by the manufacturers of the rewards we've planned out.', would've been better than no updates.
It's been over a month since you said, ""Will keep you all updated"". Where are the updates?
Robb JacobsonCreator
almost 5 years ago
Hey Mark,
We are waiting for orders to be processed by the manufacturers of the rewards we've planned out. Once we receive all the orders on all the products, we'll be shipping immediately after that. Sorry for the lack of updates, didn't want to say anything until we had something to deliver! Will keep you all updated

Very best wishes in making this film, vision impairment is an important subject which needs more coverage. We at Spectral Edge in the UK look forward to seeing the film, which we hope to use to educate those who need background on our own project for color-deficient vision called Eye2TV.

Thanks for sending images of the cards. They are look amazing! I’m wondering if including these images in the KS page would help draw in more backers. I know for me not being able to see what the cards were was a big hesitation for me and I went back and forth about backing. I really want to see this funded and anything that can be done to draw in more people is great.

Thanks! We are still waiting on the artwork from a few more artists but the rest will be posted before the end of the kickstarter! If you could share this on any social media, it would be so appreciated! :) Our instagram is @inkromancytarot :)

If I want to purchase another deck do I just add the cost to my order? The numbered decks, what happens if that number is already taken?
Jordanne Le FaeCreator

Hi Anne!
We've just been approved to get add-ons with our project, so we'll be adding those this weekend. If the number is already taken, we'll have to ask you for an alternative number. So far there only 5 backers, so your chances are pretty good to get the number you want.

Hi Dmitry,
thank you very much for your pledge and for the compliment! The painting that you like from the option 4 is reserved for you. Vielen Dank noch einmal für die Unterstützung! Leider ist mir bei den Optionen ein Fehler unterlaufen. Die Bilder sind aber in der richtigen Reihenfolge und Ihr Bild habe ich mit einem Roten Punkt markiert :-)

Hi. Is option 4 available? I can't see it among pledges :-( is it a typo? I've picked a different one for now, with the same 50EUR level. Aber Ich möchte gerne Option 4, obere rechte Ecke bitte. Zwei Bäume, orangegelb Himmel mit kleine Vögel. Schön. :-)",6

Hello Anouk, today it`s a good day because the book arrived today! But I have to say that the plastic box is no box, because it falls into pieces when I took it out of the parcel…
I hope the boxes of the other backers aren`t a puzzle too, Bernd

Hi Anouk! Wish you luck and hope that the shipping problem will be solved soon. I am a backer and I changed my address. How can I update my shipping address in order to get my copy of Automagic? I dont wanna risk to miss not receiving it... tks!
