Kefirko is brilliant. So easy to use.
I am using it to make Caspian Sea heritage yoghurt & there's nothing to do. Just put 2 Tsp of yoghurt in the jar, fill to the top mark & leave on the kitchen bench overnight with the top lid slightly open. All done- beautiful, healthy, creamy yoghurt.
Bravo.

You can try also to prepare your kefir with different types of milk. If you want to have your kefir without any bitterness at all you'll have to care that you don't have to much grains inside and that you don't ferment longer than 24h. At least that kefir and whey don't start separate...

Hello~ I'm just wondering what is the status on my kefirko? :) still haven't received my product ~
JanW
over 5 years ago
Thanks for the reply! I noticed that the Kefir I produce was improving in taste and fermentation is gradually becoming more efficient. The amount of grains I have can now ferment a full batch of milk in 24h, rather than 2/3 of a batch as was the case a few days ago. I still have a long way to go, it seems, to reach the recommended ratio between grains and milk. I'll keep trying.
Hopefully the bitter taste, which has already improved a lot, will eventually go away, too. Is there anything special they do with the commercial Kefir for it to not have any bitterness at all?
Marko Borko and Andrej GlažarCreator

@JanW
Kefir grains needs activation on the beginning. Specially if they were stored in fridge for a while.
So you have to change them milk few times before they are active again.
JanW
over 5 years ago
Hi all,
I have a question about the quantity of kefir grains I should use. If I understood correctly, the instructions that came with the Kefirko say to fill the small measuring container in the lid for a full batch of milk kefir (Kefirko filled up to the second mark). I tried that, and nothing happened. I gradually increased the amount of grains, and am now using about 1/2 cup of grains for a 2/3 filled Kefirko. That's many times the recommended amount of grains. Is anyone else experiencing this?

I want to thank all of you for your support, your inspiring ideas, and for being a part of this experimental project! Ad Lib Art: Painting as Improv is officially funded. We've made it a stunning success, raising nearly twice as much as our goal!
From the beginning I knew I couldn't do it without you. But, I had underestimated both how incredibly challenging this project was and how supportive you all would be. Your daily comments, ideas, and words of encouragement truly sustained me through this trying endeavor! In terms of creative collaboration, and making original paintings available to you guys and gals who truly love art, this has been far more successful than I had envisioned!
Thank you again, and stay tuned for the continuing updates as I finish the rest of the paintings!

Both of them is detergent. Adds durable water repellency and revives breathability in a washing machine or hand wash.
Blue bottle for jean and white bottles for shirt.

(Wash by hand)
1. Immerse shirt or jean put into the bowl or sink (hand-hot water).
2. Add half bottle detergent.
3. Agitate to mix, leave to soak for 5 - 7 minutes, then agitate thoroughly.
4. Rinse with cold water until water runs clear.
(Use Washing machine )
1. Remove all detergent build up from the detergent dispenser.
2. Place maximum of 2 clean garments in washing machine.
3. Add hold bottles to the machine.
P.S. Do not use detergents. And do not wash with other non-waterproof products.

As stated in our emails, why would I keep all of that? I’m not spending the money and time to ship back- you sent me the wrong shirt, just send another. You refused, that’s fine, I no longer care and want nothing more to do with you. I cared enough to back you and your dream - you treat me like a regular customer not a backer to help you out. All good - were done.
Brad DancerSuperbacker

Verified with my tailor, the shirt does not conform to the size table you posted, it was made wrong or labeled wrong. You won’t send me a new one, so just moving on- this isn’t a normal store purchase so you shouldn’t treat it as such

Hello,
We are sorry to hear about your situation. Actually, we already shipped orders twice last year. Although we would like to ship the product one more time to you, it is impossible for us to restart the manufacture due to the COVID-19 situation. Coronavirus hitting the manufacturing sector worse than ever as COVID-19 slows production.
Although we received your message on March 14, 2019, you mention that stop contact you. But we care about our backers, we decide to full refunds (HKD 830) via PayPal after the project has been completed around a year. It requires a 30 to 60 day processing period.
Notes: When receiving payments, there’s an additional charge on any currency conversion or transaction fee. We are not responsible if there are such additional charges and transaction fees.
Look forward to hearing from you.

Hello,
Sorry for reply late. We understand you are not happy with the quality of the product we sent you.
Therefore, we hope to know more about the problem and any potential problem before return the product. Because it may affect the held product line. We want to confer the product problem in a little more detail. Not affronts meaning.
We already send you the return detail, and we earnestly await
your reply.

When I buy shirts in the US - I'm between a L and an XL - this shirt is a youth at best. I can't even get it around my shoulders- who is this made for? not worth returning I'm donating it, but should check your sizes

Dear backers
By yesterday we have shipped all the products. It took a bit longer due to sickness in the warehouse - our sincere apologies for that. This means we are only waiting for the products to arrive. So far the production has been smooth, but there might be a hiccup at the end because it's the first time we make more than a few meters of the stuff with the amazing manufacture company.
We look forward to having shipped everything, so we can start turning this great crowdfunding experience into a real little company that we can grow and nurse for the many years. Hopefully with most of you guys as happy customers :)

Just a sizing question. I normally wear an XL but I've got quite a long body and find that a lot of the jackets I own ride too high on the waist. Which jacket has the longest body length? Or is there any way you can increase the length on the 1 I select by an inch or 3cm?

Jae, it is a perfect question that I can bring some clarification about.
We can apply any colour you see on the images to any model - regardless of gender.
However what is crucial for you to consider is, it is not about colour only. The leather used for the men's jacket are stiffer whereas the women ones have relatively softer.
In other words, if you would like us to produce a women jacket with the colour you see on the men's jackets, we can. But you should consider that it would be not as soft as women ones.
ostande
about 2 years ago
Okay, but it can't be sure from that there are colors only on images. For an example, I can't make sure if I can order dark brown color for the brandon jacket. 'cause there are only black ones men models wearing. Just let me know what colors can be ordered on each brand for now.

Dear Jae,
We appreciate to see you backing us. What you see on the images are the available colours.

We will get in touch with you depending on the outcome.

Jack, please can you take also care about people from the first KS? I´m still waiting since 7 weeks now for replacements of 2 damaged cards but haven`t got any feedback till 24.09, when you`ve said that you will contact the company to send me the 2 cards. After that the communication stopped......

Hey,Mario. I figured you received them by now since it was so long ago. I'll look this up and contact Quartermaster. They are out of the office this week, but I may be able to sort it out before then.

NEW UPDATE POSTED!
Jack DireCreator
4 months ago
“Should” be? Creators are not even obligated to use pledge managers at all. If you’re saying you personally think they always should, and that everything from the campaign should be in it, that’s one thing (that is incorrect for a lot of reasons), but saying universally that a campaign must follow your preference in this regard is a whole other thing. Every campaign is different. And the new ability to add add-on within the campaign changed this even more. The budget will only allow for so many things to be purchased. Creators are not obligated to also budget/order for post-campaign products. In many cases, that is impossible.

I don't really understand all this business about some things being available in the Pledge Manager and other things not being available in the Pledge Manager. Normally, everything in a board game Kickstarter campaign is available in the Pledge Manager.
Anyways, hopefully this is remedied and everything that was in this campaign is also available in the Pledge Manager (as it should be).

It occurs to me to ask, for those of us not on Discord, is there any update on the extra characters you were considering for year-end? (John Henry, etc.)
Thanks!

Cool! I know there was talk of just selling them in the store and other options. I'm trying to reduce my social media intake, so I worry I miss things, which kind of defeats the purpose. LOL Thanks for the update!

Will the expansion come with extra 1 action cards to properly play 3 person game? Or will there be a rules change about the starting ""Deck"" for each player in a 3person game?
Jack DireCreator

The extra cards will come with the 3/4 player gate pack, most likely.

So the six swamp zombies- is that enough to paint three as zombies and three as ghosts or will I need to decide one way or the other?

Each necromancer comes with 6 tokens for their undead, but you could paint 3 and 3, then if you run out of sculpts in a game switch to cardboard.

While I read every update, understood your beautiful prose each time, and watched the clock countdown every second, I nevertheless would now, after all is said and done, rather like to add a few things to my pledge...

Hey, Jonathan if there is still inventory available, Chapter One may be available in the pledge manager. There was not supposed to be anything but shipping in the pledge manager, but I'm still looking for a way to take care of all the people who missed the updates, FAQ, and comments about that.

Yeah, just use the price chart in the description and whatever shipping for your country will be added when you pledge. So, The $22 pledge is for a stained character box. If you wanted a veneered spell box, you pledge $36. A printed dice box would be $28. If you know what you want, I can help you price the reward if you need help.
Thanks!

Exterior size (108mm x 87mm x 27mm) and interior Size (94mm x 72mm x 15mm). A little interior space will be lost to the natural curve of the box hinge, latch, and the bottom of the spell tracker. It does hold regular sized playing cards. The spell tracker will hold around 45 cards without the dice. The standard dice box will hold a full deck of playing cards box and all with extra space to spare.

Hey Kyle - this is actually brand new artwork, created specifically for this project. However, it's by the same artist as Tiki Surf Witches - Nik Poliwko!
After I released the Tiki Surf Witches comic, a lot of people asked me if I'd make a tiki mug to go along with the book. After thinking it over, I decided to make a ""zombie glass"" instead...

Your pledge was under your name. Here are the Kickstarter instructions I found:
On Kickstarter, it's only possible to pledge to a project once from a single account. Accordingly, backers can only choose one reward tier per pledge. You can, however, change your pledge amount and reward selection for as long as a project is live.
I am suggesting to log out and create a new account in another name.

Hey Jessica! I wanna say about 90% of orders have been shipped at this point regardless of if they're domestic or international.

Both in the EU and UK, according to Shipquest, the project is in Final administrative checks. The ""Starting this week"" after it talks about the start of those checks not the shipping.
""this is the final stage before fulfilment can start. Stock is available and data is ready in the system. We need to make sure all items have the correct weights and dimensions in the system, as well as declared values, commodity code and country of origin information. Further to this, payment from the publisher needs to have been received in advance before we can begin fulfilment. We also need to make sure that the necessary packaging and void fill is available for the project, to ensure no delays during fulfilment and smooth transition onto the next project.""
So once everything is in order, fulfilment will start. aka shipping.
My guess would be shipping to start mid next week, first packages arriving the week after. March 22th

Where is the laboratory where these experiments will be conducted? Is it a dream laboratory as well? Who will conduct the experiments and what are their qualifications? Do you have any papers explaining the theoretical underpinnings for the phenomena you intend to generate in the laboratory tests?
If you currently don't know the mechanism by which this will work, how can you design a vehicle? As far as I can tell, the vehicle pictures are useless as they don't have anything to do with the project. Once you eliminate that, there is hardly anything of substance here.

Like Warren I also dream of gravity control. I also wonder how. If I may ask, what leads you to believe its possible, I would really like to here more about the results you obtained so far and how you obtained them.
As far as how to control the craft, I would imagine that while in atmosphere control surfaces could be used to direct the craft. In space depending on the level of control you have over gravity I would imagine if possible being able to lock onto various gravity wells if possible.
warren.c

I have been dreaming of tech like this for years. I am happy to see that I am not alone in this fantastic day dream. I was wondering how you were thinking that you would interact with gravity. Would it be some kind of mass manipulation, or are you going to attempt to interact with gravity itself?
Good luck!",3

Hi Hannes
Thank you for supporting the jacket! Glad you're a fan of the design. I've been wearing the pre-production sample for the last week and its everything I've always wanted...
The napoleon pockets are designed to allow you to access your phone, sunglasses, passport, wallet, etc. when the jacket is open or closed. Its something that I've wanted for many years. Also a waterproof jacket of this class with usable pockets in general is another feature missing from all the waterproof shell jackets I've traveled with in the past.
The jacket is lightweight and will average 1.5 lbs.
Safe travels,

The jacket is designed to accommodate layers. I'm wearing the heavyweight Arc'teryx fleece which is comparable to a light jacket. It's 50 degrees in NYC right now and I'm very comfortable.
Also, the collar is designed to zip closed while wearing a fleece and a scarf. This makes a big difference when Temps dip

Hi, wondering if you've tried layering with a Patagonia down sweater (or similar light down jacket) and how that fits underneath the Cubed Travel Jacket. Thanks!
Clothing ArtsCreator
almost 5 years ago
Hi Vaidya,
Glad you're a fan of the design and thank you for backing the jacket!
The jacket is a technical waterproof shell, which is highly durable and breathable. It is ideal for trekking expeditions and allows you to go from warm temperatures to very cold temperatures depending on the clothes worn under the jacket. .
In warm climates, the jacket iis all you'll need. As the temperatures drops, you'll layer a sweater or fleece underneath and this will allow you to go down to below freezing with the proper baselayers.
Thanks,
Adam

Hello Steven, Thank you so much for backing up our project! I understand that this industry is still fairly new and it is hard for some to think outside the box. First, we are creating a story and characters. We may lack of funds but our imagination is rich. We are creating a pre apocalyptic Quarantine room that will introduce the protagonist and his team. This room will be the first mobile room in Florida. We are using a 1994 Blue Bird Real Prison Bus for the ""Quarantine Prison Bus"". This will enhance the players sense of immersion since they are in a place that is 100% authentic. Also, we are using sounds and lights to enhance the immersion even further. I will be posting the description of this room soon up on our website.

TheNorthernCold

I had the same experience as Shawn but only with one container.
The contents were all over the box. Not a huge deal as I was able to remove the packing material with no problem and dump the beans back in the tin.
Not that it affects the quality of the coffee I did find the labeling to be very cheap and amateurish. It's like you made a bunch of photocopies and tapes them to the can.
I'd really advise working on your branding.
Shawn Johnson
over 5 years ago
I received my package today. I did want to let you know however, that both containers had opened up in the box, so I can't really tell the one coffee beans from the other. I suggest you place a label or something on the lid to keep it from opening up during shipping!
I'm fine with it in the end, but I don't know if everyone else will be.

Hanabi avoids the alpha player by not allowing communication. CtC encourages cooperation and discussion while playing. This can lead to more experienced players helping newer players. Because of your limited knowledge of your tray, one player can't take over the game. It is certainly possible that two players can drive the game to an extent, but it isn't always the same two players. It's often the players whose trays are in the best shape helping those who need help.

Looks like fun! Do you have a rulebook? How does the setup vary with player count? From one I can tell from the image on the campaign page, that sheet looks like it only works for 4 players?
Indie SupportCollaborator
4 months ago
We are not sharing the rulebook because it has information containing spoilers for the campaign, but are happy to answer any questions.
CtC plays 1-4. There's a specific solo module. For 2 and 3 you still set up 4 terminals, but some of them are manned by players and some of them are not. You can still interact with the marbles in those trays as normal with the different commands. You set out command cards equal to the number of players +1.

This reminds me of Hanabi, one of my favorite games. Happy to back, and looking forward to finding out more of how gameplay works (specifically, how the people in the playthrough seemed to know things about their hands before taking their first turn)

As for how players seemed to know things, there are four marbles of each color so you can count how many are in the other three players's terminals and logic into what you have.

I didn't get a chance to watch the whole playthrough, but the hidden co-operative nature reminds me a bit of Hanabi, which I loved. Looking forward to this one.

Found this project thanks to the algorithm. Super intrigued by the whole world building by different writers. And that they get paid too. Looking forward to reading this collection!

I love that the stretch goals are paying the contributors — fantastic! I think on Kickstarter, people get caught up on what they can get for nothing, but when you have fledgling communities for the arts -especially at these trying times- I think being appreciative of those artists should be the goal.
Let’s hope the project gets the attention it deserves. Can’t wait!

Thanks, Kate! I'm glad you appreciate it -- we're super happy we can make sure our authors get paid for their work, even if we wish we cold offer them even more. I do often find Kickstarter projects bend over backword to explain away every penny in a way that implies ""we are making nothing! no one is making nothing! you are getting this for close to FREEE!"" We hope all our backers appreciate we and our writers aren't getting rich from this, but that they should be compensated for the entertaining fiction they will bring you! Thanks for joining us on this project!",3

Thanks everyone for your patience! Project Update: The Electrician has been in and we'll schedule an inspection next; and the plumbers are scheduled to come in tomorrow or early next week! They've been super busy and keep telling me they're 'coming this week'... only to have family emergencies and other projects come up that need more immediate attention. So, I've been practicing patience... Meanwhile I'm going to be working on getting out the rewards, thank you for YOUR patience!!! xxoo

Quick questions for sleeving purposes:

2. What are the card sizes?
3. Do you have the total count of cards?

Hi Tomer,

I have a question. I backed the game in the first 48 hours. So i would get the mini. But i had to make a change in my payment options later. Now it says a total different date and am not a backer within the 48 hours. Will i still get the mini?

Robb De NicolaCreator

Hi David,
The game mechanic makes each play through usually come down to the wire. This leads to a lot of ""one more time!"" scenarios. Our play-testers constantly wanted to play another round. I think you will really enjoy it. Thanks for the support!

Hi, Daniela
Please know that this was not my intention. The Alice mini was already created as a later stretch goal and I wanted to share this with all backers regardless of hitting that goal. At this point in time, the Mrs. Minus mini was only an idea and financially may not even be an option. I appreciate your thoughts and all of those from the supportive kickstarter community.
Anthony Filaseta
