@MentatYP: I did mark the one used in the campaign as private since it had a couple errors.
The updated video on the installation guide webpage here: https://geodegaming.com/pages/jasper-compatible-dovetail-mount-installation is fully updated for the Cup Holder Mounts
For a side shelf, that webpage above also has very detailed step by step instructions under the video to go over some of the finer details with making sure you get a great alignment on the full length of the longer mounts.
If you have any additional questions, feel free to reach out at support@geodegaming.com
Hope this helps!

@Dan Johnson: Thanks Dan!
I was a little hesitant to say the side shelf can be stored underneath since it just barely fits (if you want access to the storage on both sides of the table, as I’ve shown in the photos) and I’m still a bit worried about the back half of the shelf that hangs low. Watch your knees :) It’s also a bit heavy to be lining up while hanging it under the table.
That said we have put ours under there before, but honestly the side shelf has rarely left our table since adding our new mounts. Most rule books fit on it quite well (except Pendulum).

Received and installed in PA. Got enough for the storage under the table as well and glad to say it holds the side tables underneath as well. Great job!

Received and installed here. Installation tool was great and made placement / alignment a breeze. The holders are a little bit looser than the wood ones that shipped on the table but it seems like they should still hold alright. Going to be nice to have cup spots on the ends of the long edges!
Rob ColatuttoCreatorSuperbacker
6 months ago
Really glad to hear the installation was easy! I'm a bit surprised though that the fit feels looser than the stock mounts, as I've made these slightly larger than the stock mounts to give it just a little bit tighter of a fit.
I'd actually had the mounts quite a bit tighter than the stock mounts originally but dialed it back down towards the stock sizing when I moved from a 'for our table only' project to a fits all Jaspers and Duchess' ever constructed KS project. It turns out there is a fair amount of variation in the dovetail sizing all around, multiple iterations of the groove, etc.
Would you mind sharing a photo or two with me on the fit between the stock and the new mounts, at support@geodegaming.com ? Curious also if you tried all your cup holders and if the results are consistent. We have one cup holder on our end that the cuts in the cup holder don't quite line up with the shape of the mount, and its pretty loose all around our table.
Graham Budd

Rob, pictures sent to that email address. As noted in the email the looseness is not concerning, it doesn't feel as though the holders are going to slip off or anything.

Not to worry! Also good catch finding that, I'll update with a few photos clarifying the way it should sit. Sometimes its really easy to miss an alternate way things could be put together when you've designed it.
Overall though I'm very glad its a good fit! You had me worried that there may be a lot more variation in the wine holders than I'd thought.
Rob ColatuttoCreatorSuperbacker
6 months ago
@Russonc: that’s a lot more than it should be closing off. Most I’ve seen is about 1/8” so far. Thanks for the info, I’ll keep an eye out for a photo
RussoncSuperbacker

Received in NC. the mounts look to fit great (I had one of the early models).
Wine holder ... slightly too big (makes the opening a bit smaller) Really tight on large stemmed glasses; but nice on the thin stemmed ones.
Thanks for doing this, great idea!

Would you mind sending me a photo over at support@geodegaming.com of the fit of the Riser in the Wine Glass Holder? Its very possible that the first batch of Wine Holders you got with your table were made with a smaller opening, and got revised before any copies we've seen.
That said, the fit is supposed to be a bit tight, not overly so, but tight enough that theres enough resistance that the Riser does not spin freely, but not too much that its hard for you to rotate it to 'lock' in the glass, if desired. Depending how tight the tolerances on the hole in the Wine Glass Holder is, this could result in the opening being made slightly smaller, as you've described. Either way, would love to see a photo of the fit your describing, but glad you've a simple work around that fits your favorite glass.
RussoncSuperbacker
6 months ago
@Rob, I will try to get to it this weekend. It does fit nicely, snug but able to spin. But with the insert flush to one side of the opening, I lose about 3/8"" on the other side (so overall gap is 3/8"" smaller with the insert). I'll likely shave 1/2"" off and it should work as planned. (but I will try to get a picture out to you.).

@John Stoneham: Unfortunately I only know one person in town with the Duchess, and it’s a Black model.
I believe the Duchess Brown has a bit of a Red hue to it as well, so my best guess would be the light brown, if you wanted a wood tone.
If anyone in San Diego who backed has a Duchess in Brown, please send me a message and we may be able to sort out a few photos for the other backers.

We often keep a fresh Mysterium set up under the topper. It's our go-to family game during quarantine and having it set up and ready to go makes it a lot easier to play quickly when the time presents itself.
On top is usually the kiddo's arts and crafts stuff (plus my mini painting items).

Judy can take complicated material and make it easy to understand written with nonpartisan sentiment. Ms. Frankel also takes us on her compelling personal journey of perseverance to reach a wider audience with crucial information . This book makes me believe there are real solutions! Mary Hatch

Got mine a couple of days ago. I seemed to have lucked out as mine was shipped in a box as I had a lot of add-ons. Everything arrived safe and sound. Only about 28 pages in and I already have so many questions that I hope are answered, or at least alluded to, later in the book. Such as Portals not connecting to Locked/Lost Worlds vs events as seen in Shadow Menace. I'm kicking myself for not getting the other companion book so I can see what each says about their own views on the Metaverse. Going to have to check out the tabletop game series as well now.

I just got my deluxe hardcover; it's amazing looking and I can't wait ti9 dig into it. However; it was just shipped in an oversized padded envelope which got beat to hell and ripped in three places. Three of the four corners are smashed like it was dropped from a few feet in the air,
Love you guys, love what you do, and happy to support you. For a $100 deluxe collectible hardcover, it really should have been shipped in a box to protect it better. I'd have gladly paid more for shipping.
Not looking for a refund or swap; just wanted to provide some feedback. Hopefully next time there are better shipping choices available.

Hi all, unfortunately USPS has been inundated with packages and some are not getting the proper intermediate scans. We've consulted with our fulfillment partner over the issue and it's been something experienced by many of their clients. Typically, they're seeing that if a package is missing its intermediate scans, it won't show anything on tracking until ""delivered"". We ask for your patience right now if your package isn't showing intermediate scans as most of these will resolve themselves. If you still don't receive the package and it is in the 3-4 weeks out range, please email norita@zombieorpheus.com and we'll investigate further.

Anyone who backed JQ3.5 at $50 or more should not back this campaign because they are already getting shipped a copy. Instead if they want to upgrade/add copies they need to take a survey to unlock their JQ3.5 pledge. Then once this campaign is over those JQ3.5 pledges will be unlocked and people will be able to upgrade and/or add copies to their original pledge. Do I understand that correctly? If not, please elaborate. Thanks!

I'm sorry, but I don't think so. I don't think there's enough demand of extra languages for now, and they take a lot of effort to make. However, it could be a possibility for the future if enough people want it.
For now, I think if you get Blabel Deluxe you'll see that 4 languages packs is more than enough to play the game a million times.

Its originality is one of Blabel's strong points, indeed. I'm very proud of that! I'm can't wait for you to play it!

We plan to distribute the game as much as possible, so we'll try to get it into retail stores. There are no active plans to sell the game to publishing companies, but it's not out of the question. We're small indie devs, so all this is not very likely to happen in the near future.
The Kickstarter exclusive languages of Blabel Deluxe will never be sold anywhere else, though.

I find Kickstarter exclusives (most especially those that affect gameplay) to be really unfortunate. It's unfair to those who don't find the game until later, and I can't help but think that you're losing people who feel that they're not getting the entire game.

It would be interesting to see an expansion with full phrases, perhaps to describe variable placement/orientation when building a structure. This would likely increase the difficulty, but could offer a more complex variant, if desired. The idea would be similar to games like Ugg-tect, but within the Blabel language design.
Tomás TarragónCreator
5 months ago
That was one of the very first ideas for the game! The difficulty grows exponentially though, so it's kinda tricky to balance. But an expansion could in theory have something like that. Thanks for the suggestion!

The Blabel languages are made up! But each of them is based on a real language.
For example, in the Blabel language that's based on English we have ""gander"", in Blabel Italian, we have ""vacatto"", and in Blabel Spanish we have ""metacon"".
These words don't mean anything!
PJ
5 months ago
For what it's worth, ""gander"" is an actual English word. It means a male goose, or to look (as in, ""have a gander at that!"").
Tomás TarragónCreator

That's true! I made up that word on the spot while writing the comment, and forgot to check. It won't be in the game anyway!
Good catch, PJ!

First of all, congratulations!
Now that we are in an overfunding environment I would like to ask about the possible upgrades.
Are the upgrades going to be the same for each bracket? I mean, are they all going to be new words for the game? If not, can we get a teaser on what can we expect?
Tomás TarragónCreator
5 months ago
Good question!
No, the first upgrade is +10 word cards, but other upgrades will be completely different.
I can tell you that there will be some fun upgrades to the components. The Foreman and Lookout tokens... could be cooler, right? ;)

Hi! I got a question, how are the rules dealing with gestures? Like acting something with your hands and body or pointing at things?
Tomás TarragónCreator
5 months ago
Good question!
You can't acting things you want to build, like ""door"" or ""glass"", and you can't point to the cards on the table.
However, you can do gestures to communicate things like ""yes"", ""no"", ""I don't know"", ""repeat"", etc.

So, I like my Labfresh shirt a lot; it's very comfortable and fits well, and for the most part stains are a non-issue.
But it's starting to develop yellow stains (presumably from sweat?), and even washing with Oxy-Clean doesn't seem to help. Any suggestions?

Hi Jefepato, thank you for your message! Unfortunately, the yellow stains are not something we can fix. It's due to sweat and deodorant. What can help is buying a deodorant without aluminium.

Hi Siegfredo, thank you for your message!
Because the shirt is water repellent you need more water while ironing. The shirt also dries really quick so the best way is to centrifuge as little as possible and iron it directly when it comes wet out of the washer. When you do like that then it should be fine! :)
I will email you about your other question.

Hi Ray,
Thank you for your message! After the first wash the repellency goes maybe down a bit but not enough to not work anymore.
It does however only repel liquids based on water, not sure about liquors exactly. Maybe they have some oils in them or the strong amount of alcohol.
Did you manage to wash it off later in the wash?
It helps to use some stainremover and wash on 40 degrees. Let me know how that goes!

The Dog Catcher game looks like a lot of fun!
I hope the makers offer 5 and 10 deck bulk purchasing. I already have some people in mind to send as a gift.
My friends and family have been having more stay home game nights this summer. I've found everyone is more eager to learn a new card game with its own deck. I guess the classic deck of 52 cards is just old fashioned these days.
I do have some cat loving friends, but most everyone in my life favors dogs over cats any day of the week.
That being said, I expect some excitement to get a round of this game going.
Teenie Tiny Tiki GamesCreator

Finnious, thanks for the great comments. We certainly hope that we gain enough momentum to offer the bulk orders that you suggest. Of course, right now anyone can add multiple decks to their pledge. Just increase the pledge to cover additional decks.

@Leovardo
Apologies. Don't mean to be malicious - just having a 💩 day. As it has become clear that the problem is KS reporting to Jose that they only drafted MX$500 and my financial institutions show USD $500 as already taken. That's $475 USD beyond the pledge, not Pesos mind you, fuqin gone. With a dead end KS phone number telling one to go onto the Website FAQ. And guess what's not a topic there?! ""Kickstarter overbilled me on a project, and falsely reported to said project's creator that they drafted only what was inititially shown. Meanwhile, the difference sits in KS's account with no course of action by the Backer.
Either way, I commented above regarding Jose's prompt response and imagery proving KS is the problem here. Removing the comment-section-indiction and feel that it ""seemed"" he was disingenuous regarding changes and the currency of the project. Which I knew from before was in MX$, but see USD were literally already drafted.
FTR, I had zero issues with this or the previous project, nor other projects from elsewhere in the world (outside US). Hell, I'm Backer #2 in this one - and 1st Backer at All In. So, the only loss in confidence from my end - is this significantly obscene KS SNAFU. Which will now affect all future KS Projects for myself, maybe others to - from all creators, and this one. 🤷🤦😠

My intentions with this type of project will NEVER be fraud, this platform has such a noble intention that when I met him (a year ago) I couldn't believe that something like this existed.
I hope that all these problems will be solved in the future, and misunderstandings are avoided.

I understand that the price is high and not erveryone has the money for everything (me included), but it does not look like this KS would have reached this stretch goals anyway. As addon we at least have an option of getting these if we like so (besides helping reaching the funding goal).

Hello,
Ok I understood that you can not print and therefore photograph your objects no worries.
But I would like to see objects in the form of separate items printable ... tents of the basic project for example and one of the vehicles because $20 for a helicopter or a missile launcher of 20cm single-block is overpriced.
Also if the large objects are one-piece I have a doubt about the impression of a 1mm backpack loop
José Francisco BautistaCreator

Hi Olivier!
Don't worry, the pieces will be separate items printable so they can be assembled later.
You will have the possibility of having a single piece, but also of having the model in parts.

If the equipment add-on is purchased what soldier can the equipment be placed on? The weapons can be added to the three soldiers that were in the original add-on, but these soldiers are pre-equipped. The unequipped soldier is still locked, so I am guessing that he is not going to be included in any pack. I am a lot less likely to add the equipment add-on without a soldier to put it on.

Hi Michael!
You're right!
Thanks to your comment I have added a new update.
If you add the add on ""equipment pack"" or ""all military base"" the character poses will be FREE.

Hi Aaprox,
I found the settings. But can I ask what’s the feature that will be implemented inside the app? Or will the current state be all?
For example, I want to have some kind of geo fence to turn off all of my devices when I’m away. Or multiple turning on and off. Or regular turning on and off everyday (I haven’t tried but judging by the UI, I don’t think it is possible)
If possible, can you share us a road map of things you will try to achieve?
AdaproxCreator
over 1 year ago
Hi Tri,
In the detail page, you can swipe to change the feature tab. Currently, we have implemented timer, SOS and Siri voice control.
If everything goes okay, we'll release a hub on Kickstarter with another new product in November or December this year. The hub plays the role of coordinator of all the Adaprox products. It connects to Wifi and can bring all the devices to the Internet and you . Also, it can help control multiple devices at the same time and turn on/off on a regular basis.
The geo fence functionality can be achieved with an extra beacon device. We'll look at the possibility to put it into our product line.
Currently, we are planning to develop a virtual device button to group multiple devices and help connect and control them simultaneously with your smartphone.
Kind Regards,
Adaprox AU

I cna confirm Renee's issue and solution. You won't be able to successfully discover a switch unless you enable your GPS/location. The app asks for location permission, but doesn't actually check if location services are enabled or not. It would be worth updating the app to check if they're enabled, and asking the user to enable them if they are not.

AdaproxCreator

Hi Wallace,
Congrats! I think you are the first backer to get the package.
Before using SwitchRobot, there are some guidelines to be aware of:
1. Wipe to clean the switch panel first
2. Do not install the SwitchRobot immediately after attaching the magnet board to the panel. You can leave the magnet board for a while. 60% of the adhesion will be reached within 1 hour and 100% will reach 100% within 24 hours.
3. If SwitchRobot gets stuck when pushing the switch button, add suitable magnet gaskets onto the magnet board carefully to pad up the robot.
Currently, Android App still has some bug to fix. We will solve it in a few days.
Thanks for supporting :-)
Kind Regards,
Adaprox AU

Is the plate that sticks to the switch easily removable, or would it be better to buy and use some 3M removable stickers to hold it onto the switch for easy removal at a later date?
AdaproxCreator
almost 2 years ago
Hi Jonzay,
Thanks for your interest!
You don't need to buy additional 3M tapes since we already customize one from a 3M manufacturer.
After you stick it onto the home switch panel, in the first minutes you can easily remove it and adjust the position to avoid misplacing.
70% of its maximum adhesion will be reached after 10 minutes and its maximum adhesion will be reached after 24 hours.
The material is acrylic, which is quite strong. It is similar to this one: https://www.amazon.com/Resistant-Acrylic-Double-Adhesive-Sticker/dp/B074DV1YRL
Hope this will help. Have a nice day!

Hi !
I assume that each box works for one room ? Why can’t you make another option for 5 boxes instead of a t -shirt for $100 ? Nobody wants a t -shirt , but could use another box 👍Just a suggestion if we don’t need 10, but want more than 4 ? Good luck on a brilliant idea. I hope that they won’t be defective because we can’t fix them in the USA. Also , I hope it’s not too complicated to set up with your phone. I have an apple. It will work with it ?

Congratulations for the game. It feels real interesting. I have a question. Hase each scenario different and specific events or are the same for all of them?
Buster LehnCollaborator
3 months ago
@Jorge Moya-Higueras: There are two elements in the game that will work as ""events"". On one hand you have the police deck where the regular events are, which is the same for all the missions; on the other, you have the mission cards, which will add or change the rules of each scenario and will bring new elements to the game. Combining those two you get huge replayability.
Thank you for your support!
-------------------
En el juego hay dos elementos que funcionan como ""eventos"". Por un lado tienes las cartas de policía donde se encuentran los eventos estándar, que es común para todas las misiones; por otro lado tienes las cartas de misión que añaden o modifican las reglas de cada escenario y que traen nuevos elementos al juego. Combinando estos dos elementos se consigue una gran rejugabilidad.

@Garfio13: At the time being, each scenario includes 4 mission cards that will narrate the story of that scenario and will modify the rules to match that story; that is, the rule changes for each scenario are story-driven and have been balanced for a smooth experience. But it is something we will certainly take into consideration for future SG's.
Thank you for your suggestions and support!

En este momento, cada escenario incluye 4 cartas de misión que te contarán la historia de ese escenario y modificarán las reglas de forma que encaje con esa historia; es decir, los cambios de reglas de cada escenario están basados en la historia, para asegurar una experiencia de juego fluida.

I was on the fence for a long time and had made the decision not to back. I thought the art looked really nice, the gameplay looked fun, and the quality looked great...but I don’t think my game group would enjoy it and I was going to be playing primarily the solo mode. Not being able to use the Quests and the Noble Houses was what made my decision. But...when I saw the update this week which made it so you CAN play solo with the Quests and Noble Houses, and the addition of a Political victory, I’ve changed my mind and have backed. Thanks for developing the game beyond what was presented in the campaign.
Do you have any plans to add additional solo modes in the future, either through expansions, print and play, or more surprises prior to release?

Hi. So here's a wacky question. I was fixing up my pledge for a totally different game and noticed that my old address was still on Backer Kit even though I definitely changed it for Shaolia's expansion. So I checked my Shaolia pledge and saw that BOTH of my addresses are listed in my order. I edited shipping but my old address does not show up in the boxes. When I resubmitted, both of my addresses are still listed. How can we get ONLY my new address listed? (I didn't have this problem for the unrelated game.)

Bender-008

On the other side, some people messaged the project asking how long the pledge manager would be open to raise funds for an all in pledge, only to be told the price would increase if you didn’t have a game pledge. This caused some people to have to pledge a lower amount for only the base game not the PM access and thus raise the amount received during the campaign but not actual funds for the game.

Shipping was collected in the pledge, but additional shipping is required in the PM?

This appears to be a Gamefound bug. I clicked the Add More Items button after closing my order to double check if I wanted something extra. Although I didn't actually add anything, apparently that did something to my order which caused it tor ask for more shipping. Reverting to my original order via the three-dots button cleared the problem up.

@ Bad Comet,
Congrats on a successful campaign.
90 microns sleeves sounds great and I added them during the campaign,however, please have a look at the sleeves used by the game ""Dungeon Drop"", they also use square sleeves (a bit larger) and have fantastic sleeves for their square cards!
According to Phase Shift Games (the creators of Dungeon Drop), there is almost no price difference between thick and regular sleeves.

I ended up sticking it onto my old clear case and it looks good (like a new case) but more importantly it works well. As it is all Apple Pay now I use the card slots for ‘analog’ shit like rail tickets,plus one or two bank notes,handy when we hit small places that insist on cash. As a stand it also does it’s job well,good in both portrait and landscape modes...
Good product - glad I fitted it 😉👍

Hello,
Sorry I just backed this project... and I'm not able to read all comments,
Does it support iphone 7 plus? because I did not see it in the video... its camera from the back is horizontal and not vertical like the new models.
Also one more suggestion, I donno I anyone suggested before, it could be an add on... So I use a magnetic mount as a car stand... maybe include a magnetic metal paper tin plate (half the size of a credit card) which can by put in the outermost card slot...
I'm just thinking out loud,
Best of luck :)

Well, now you have a cinnamon gin for those holiday drinks right? Certain spices like cinnamon, allspice, and cloves can be super potent, and high proof vodka will extract the most flavor from them. I once made a batch of pickles that called for allspice and I must have used too much because that was all we could taste.
Last year I switched from cinnamon sticks to chips because a 4 inch stick can vary in weight from 2 to 10 grams, so it's hard to make an accurate recipe using sticks as a unit. You also have to break them up if you want less than a whole stick. I find that two teaspoons of chips is roughly equivalent to one medium stick if you're trying to convert a recipe.

B Chest width 51cm

Hi Marlon - It's tough to say as we don't know the exact points of origin for those measurements. However, it looks like the closely correspond to a Medium in our Men's fit. See The Size Guide on our campaign home page for our measurements and please reach out with any additional questions.

Pledged on Kickstarter ($229.00)

What is the $71 for? --> My pledge covers the item and shipping + I selected no add-ons.
As today is the last day to submit the choices, I ask you to do please manually select for me:
QTY ITEM
1 301001007

Hi Marlon - It looks as though you selected ""shipping within the US"" on Kickstarter. It seems as though the difference is an international shipping rate to Holland after you confirmed the delivery address. Your sweater choices look to be all set and valid once you complete the survey and difference for international shipping. We won't close Official Order Surveys until Monday! Let us know if other questions pop up.

Hey Darren,
I received my package about a week ago but I'm just now sitting down to really check out all of the goodies and take a closer look at the book. Reading through some of the other comments here, I see that a few people experienced issues with damage/missing items.
I believe I received all of the rewards: an enamel pin, the sticker of the commissioned art as well as the larger print of it, the bookmark, and the screenshot postcard. So, all is well there, and each reward looks great! Pretty cool.
As for the book itself, it's great! Unfortunately, there are a couple of damaged spots on the slipcase: on the bottom of one of the sides, it is indented a little bit and on the end that says ""Sony's PlayStation"" there appears to be some minor tearing/separating of the paper toward the top. And I assume this is an issue with the spot UV, but I noticed there were tiny bits of material that looked like plastic flaking off on both the slipcase and the book, mostly around the edges. But again, just to emphasize: this is all very minor to me, I just want you to be aware of it because I know you have plans for more books in the future. I don't think any of the damage is your fault, because the package was extremely well-protected (rolled multiple times in bubble wrap!), it's obvious you did your part in trying to make sure it wasn't damaged. I assume the issues are from when the distributor originally mailed the books out.
All of that aside, I want to end on a positive note: I'm happy with it, and the issues above are really not a deal-breaker, I just want you to be aware for your future projects in case you plan on making any adjustments. If the internet ever vanishes and we can't just Google screenshots of stuff, I'll at least have this book so I can go back and experience some nostalgia. :-) Looking forward to your next project(s), I believe you've said CAPCOM is next? If so, I may end up supporting that one as well! I'm not as familiar/don't have as much nostalgia tied to it, but I think it would be cool to have that as a collection item in addition to this PlayStation book. Thanks for doing this project, and best wishes for any project you do in the future! I hope you keep us updated on that, hopefully Kickstarter will let you send out messages to past backers to get the word out (and maybe Game Rant, or someone else, will write an article again! I think that's how I found out about this project the first time).

Hi Darren, it was a monumental undertaking and you pulled it off, but I would definitely have words with your printing partner when you can as there are quite a few hiccups with the entire presentation that I hope you can work out before future installments. The image bleed to edge needs to be taken into account because nearly every image is cropped every so slightly off in the margins thus offsetting the composition of the images and layouts. Easiest way to see this is when you compare the hardcopy against the PDF proof. It is especially noticeable in the four image pages in which the margins become asymmetrical thus distracting from the layout. Secondly, resolution of the images is great but the color saturation and contrast is not balanced thus causing a great deal of darker images to be very hard to read. I know that the publishing industry now is pretty much set on using PDF's as proofs, but I would make sure that future editions printers proofs are processed in CMYK so there is 0 deviation from what you painstakingly laid out! They need to crop their pages better as well as I had a pretty surprisingly high amount of loose remnants in there. The embossed slip cover was a really nice touch, but I already see it beginning to peel up. That ""Made in China"" sticker was also god-awful ugly and difficult to remove without denting part of the cover. There were also a handful of pages missing from the PDF and I don't remember if you said you dropped them or switched them out. I would make note of the issues and let your printer know as their errors should not detract from your work. Nonetheless, hats off to you sir, and I look forward to the next one!

@Ian I know! The next one I am working on (because I already have the work flow for it) is Capcom’s PlayStation. I know doing smaller companion books to this Sony one would be cool, as well.

I commented on the update, but I’ll leave it here, too.
It’s a postcard. The back will have a full printed screenshot, like in the image. I’ve found a printing company that’ll let me do a “variety” pack and I’ll have as many variants as I can get. The reverse side will have a place to add an address, a stamp, and a note and you can mail it off to someone.
Depending on total number of backers and costs, everyone will get AT LEAST one postcard. If I can print more, I will, and include extras as quantities allow.

To clear up any confusion or MISHAP!s, we wanted to clarify that when you make a pledge in this KickStarter, you are receiving ONLY the awards at the level you purchase, and these items are spelled out in the listing of each reward. If you buy an item that has sizing requirements (Tees, sweatshirts, etc.), we will send you a note when the campaign ends to get your size.
Thanks and stay tuned as we wind down to the finish line this week! :)

@Louis @Michael- we hear you guys. Michael, we've been getting consistent feedback that the tracking dates being quoted are very generous (see @rickie's comment below). We sent everything domestic via USPS Priority, which generally takes 1-3 days. Louis, unfortunately the Splatter XL are the last to ship out (they go out tomorrow)- so it should get to NY by early next week.
We realize it's frustrating that your RompHims are being delivered towards the end of summer, but we know the Romp Squad is gonna get use out of these year-round. And although they may be a ""meme"" for some people, they're far from a joke to us- we think the RompHim is all about self-expression and owning your style, and that's here to stay no matter the season.
Michael Apuzzo
over 3 years ago
Second what Louis said... I received confirmation and was given a delivery date of September 8th when these, originally, were supposed to be here in August, and a couple weeks ago were told they'd be here before Labor Day. I understand too this is a new project for you all, but these shipments should have atleast been overnighted to compensate for how late they are. You asked everyone to pledge $100 to a product they thoght they'd have for atleast some point during this summer, and instead people aren't even receiving them until mid September.
Louis Prizzi

Have yet to receive any shipping info.... the ""hot item of the summer"" isn't gonna be here until well into September.... really disappointed in this whole experience.... I understand that this whole thing is a lot huger than you guys expected, but you gotta see where we're all coming from here... we spent $100 on a summer garment that's basically become a meme, and we won't have it for the summer of 2017....

Hey Ronald,
We apologize for not getting you these updates sooner. We have been back and forth with the manufacturer, working on getting a concrete delivery date for you. On a personal level, as the creator, I hate to say something (I am talking about delivery time) and then not be able to make it happen. So even with an aggressive timeline originally, it is frustrating not to have things to you sooner at the time originally given. I do understand that these things are normal for kickstarter but for me it is not. Due to this I have been hesitant to give an update until I know absolutely for sure what we are looking at in terms of delivery. I do understand that on the other side of this, more communication is better. I will have an update to you by tomorrow. Products are being run currently.
Best regards,

One question about the washing instructions: You state cold wash only... is this to maintain the stain resistance or for other reasons, too?
Will the anti-wrinkle and temperature regulation continue to work after many washings? Even if washed with other “normal” shirts at 40°C?
CheegsCreator
5 months ago
Great question Fabian. Washing with cooler temperature will give your shirt a longer lifetime. Lifetime will depend on usage, care, and storage. In general washing at cooler temperatures (30 degrees and lower) will help the product last longer and look better.
We want you to get the most out of your Cheegs Shirt and although we have tested and engineered the shirts to last many washings, cooler washing is the one thing we recommend to keep the shirt and you happier. A happy shirt means a happy man.

Adam, thank you for your interest in Cheegs. I do not know your skin so it is hard for me to answer this. What I can tell you is that our shirts are not made with cotton and are instead a recycled polyester blend with our PCM infused poly. It is soft to the skin and through our testing we have not found it to cause irritation. I hope this helps. If you have more questions about the fabric, let me know.

yes, I saw that. My question doesn’t refer to the possibility of shipping but the friendliness to ship to Europe. This takes into account: Do you ship from a European warehouse? Do you ship in bulk to Europe and then use a local distributor, ...
Shipping from outside of the EU to the EU would mean a lot of customs duties and VAT for every EU-backer, hence the question.

Sorry, but the option for Canada is still showing 25 USD and I can't post here unless I have a pledge, so I re-pledged. Please let me know when it for sure is working so I can change it.
Thanks!

Hi Alex,
I agree with last few comments posted here, it would be nice to share an update when the shirts will be distributed. I suppose the most of people will accept a delay, because often not everything can be done exactly as scheduled originally, but a silence is not good.
Because I'd like to use the shirt as gift in February, not fulfilled expected delivery in January makes me a bit nervous...
With regards,

This company is all class, I received one of the small sized jackets by mistake and I already have the details for the replacement shipment, Kristin couldn't have been more supportive!

Hi Jahn. Sorry you missed us this weekend! We had sent an update about Brunch at Sink | Swim on Saturday last week via Kickstarter updates. The Scofflaw thing was a last minute addition so we didn't have the chance to utilize all channels. We mentioned it on our Facebook and Instagram pages (@damnfinechicago)...
We're unsure if we'll be passing out anything else prior to opening.
Opening date as mentioned is still TBD but we are hoping for mid-July! All backers will be notified before anyone else! Surveys are also being sent this week to finalize rewards.
Thanks again!

Hi,
I think I am going to have about 37 “leftovers” I’m pretty sure I was pledged 63 paintings but felt I needed to get to 100 to make it official so I do plan to put the “leftovers” up on my site once everything is done.
I’ll be charging basically the same kickstarter price (a few dollars more – I underestimated the shipping a little)
I will certainly keep you apprised once it happens – thank you for the continued interest! I’m glad they resonate so well.
Best,
Jason

Hi Jason, I envision the first one showing up about a week from this Sunday. www.jasonbrockert.com under the 100 trees category. I think it will be as simple as the first person to leave a comment ""I want this one"" will be the person who gets that painting. And I'll keep uploading them consistently on Sundays until everything is claimed.

For selection of paintings, I have a dedicated page on my website and I think I will upload a number of paintings each week as they are made and send a weekly reminder. I'm still tinkering with when to upload (all at the same time each week - or randomly and individually) and I'm leaning towards same time and all at once and then sending a reminder right after uploading. Thoughts?

Love the game but HATE the smell of the Chinese plastic. It has been over 1.5 months and it's still noticeable & strong. Used the game last week at the American Century Classic for 6 days straight. I'm sure that will help the odor a lot...and I'm sure we helped sell a lot of Chippos. People LOVED it and asked a lot of questions. Thank you.

@Darrell Gudenau: what a way to start the day! Rise and Chip. Hashtag that.
Yes - hitting any part of the board on a fly counts as one point.
No - the ball must hit the board on a fly. UNLESS you can bounce it off the front mat on a fly. THAT doubles your points.
Also, if it bounces off the board and into the hole, you get the points for that hole. People have asked this as well.
We are working on a video that explains scoring better as we speak and will upload it soon.
Thanks man!!!!

Received my board, already making a routine of playing every morning before I head off to work! A couple questions about the rules... Does it count as a point if it hits the white part of the board or only the turf part? Also, does it count as any points if it bounces off the ground onto the board?

Hey Josh and Ken! Thanks for checking in! Everyone should definitely have their Chippo sets by Mid-June.
The first large shipment which is going straight out to Kickstarter backers as soon as it gets to our warehouse in Michigan is currently on a train heading to Chicago from port in Vancouver. It is scheduled to arrive in Chicago 5/23. From Chicago, it needs to go through Customs and then by truck to Michigan. So, while we truly wish that we could get these out to you by Memorial Day weekend, barring an unexpected early arrival in Chicago, it looks like it will be cutting it close to have them arrive to you by 5/26. But we will keep you posted!

Complete crap. As stated here, all backers of this product were gorilla testers. They have released a version 2. Version 1 could potentially work fine if they updated the firmware - as the product (hardware) has great potential.
I wrote to them very early advising this, even listing suggestions for tweaks - not so much as an acknowledgement, let alone a thanks for composing a detailed feedback and suggestion of rectification of failures.
I’ll try to set mine up ‘hardwired’ and hope for a firmware update 🤷‍♂️

This company has extremely poor products.
Jerry Huang is the person that always replies when I contact customer support.
The service is so bad..
Example.
My recent issue is my account seems to have stopped working. (wonder why, punishment?)
So I contact and explain, try to log in and says invalid user account.
Access web site and same.
Jerry reply was ""we are releasing a new update to app that will fix""
So I reply that.. ok great. But the web site and the app are not related. I can not log into either.
Jerry Huang reply at Litmor was ""Yes the app and web site are different.
No kiddin Jerry.
This is the quality of service you will get from Jerry Huang at Litmor.
Ignored my issue and repeated what I had already stated,
What is wrong with Litmor.
How can they have someone like this work there.
You would be better off closing your customer service.. so at least buyers would think your just to busy to reply.
In place of proof you are incompetent

I think the problem is language/translation. Jerry was very helpful to me and gave me a refund. Especially after I had a shit experience with gabrielle who had kicked and blocked me from the group after privately asking a few questions :D

Two cameras. Can’t hear the voice from the other line. The video is lagging eventhough internet connection is great. Any recommendations from the maker?

I waited long enough for them to work out the bugs and just started up 5 of my cameras last night. Though a few hicks up to figure out, they worked better then I expected, except one thing.
Your battery camera doesn't support 5GHz Wi-Fi. Litmor battery camera only supports 2.4GHz Wi-Fi network.
My base WiFi router is 2.4 GHz, while I have (3) 1500’ Eero boosters off this to cover my house and brothers won’t work. Got to his front door with about 58-60%, but with my house and the garage in the way, I would have to reactive it.
So I suggest using the Nect modem on Indiegogo. I got 2 ordered with vp and basically going to daisy chain off of them to get my network of 17 cameras up and running. Then I have to take 2 Nect modem to my Aunts house and hook up another 5 camera’s. In for a penny in for a pound.
https://nectmodem.kckb.st/373d55b8
P.S. I did find a 39’ booster cable and (2) 16’ booster cables with 7 port hub. Which mean you could charge it from a usb wall socket about 3 camera’s, w/o worry about battery life. Though I need another 16’ cable to get to out to the 3. About $150 approximately. 7x 128 cards $209. Ouch hoping long term.

Meanwhile I already bought a Capsule camera and 2 of the new Battery cams 2. When you figure out, that most problems are software-related, then you get it to work (apart from the poor battery life, but sh*t happens).
Still love this cams.

Such a let down. Two cameras have never worked properly since arrival. Last email in April said I should try one last fix out they would replace them.
Three months later and 11 emails from me and not a peep.

People here will be thrilled to know that all the backers here were beta testers and they are now selling a Battery Cam 2 for only $49.99 instead of the $89.99.
And they claim on the 2nd one that the battery lasts 5 months if it is triggered less than 8 times a day. That's funny :D as the first battery cam lasted supposedly 1 year (still says so on their own website) so the new upgraded camera is a downgrade? :D

So cameras sent back as agreed, and no refund. Absolute joke. If they hadnt been sent back i wouldnt even use as a door stop

I finally installed it for my dad and the camera is really really sensitive. On medium sensitivity, it will pick up anything and everything...even if there is nothing and just something floating in the air. I had to put both cameras on low. The monitoring area still picks up movement outside of the area you selected. This all ends up causing the battery to drain dramatically which can last 1 week at most. Far from the 1 year.
I ended up buying 20ft USB cable and routing it to the inside of the house so that my dad can easily plug in the USB cable to charge without having to climb a ladder, unscrew the camera and put it back up again every week.

Stand corrected. The batteries running out so much faster even with minor movements. So, basically it can only last about a year if there aren't anything that moves.

I will say that after contacting kickstarter about this, it was delivered a week or so later. I will not be using the product, nor will I support this company ever again in the future. The creator of this project needs to take a class on communication or acquire the skill some other way.
I will be actively discouraging anyone who thinks about purchasing this product if it ever does hit retail stores.

Hello Backers! First, my sincere apologies for the delay on updates. Here is where we stand at the moment- paperwork has been filed and accepted successfully by the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control and is being reviewed for both the Rectifiers License and the Distilled beverage Distributor license required to put SLO Bitter Co. Bitters on retail shelves. We are told by the compliance company who filed the paperwork that the process can take anywhere from 3-9 months depending on the backlog, so we are crossing our fingers for a smooth and quick process!!
We are confident that the licensing will be approved and are incredibly grateful to all our supporters and backers. The estimated time of delivery in the rewards description says August, and we are confident we can meet that delivery goal. This week backers will be receiving surveys to gather the necessary info for fulfillment. Happy 4th of July, hope everyone enjoys a delicious libation!
Davis mabry

Two months, no updates or contact at all from the creator at all. At this point i'm feeling that this was a scam. If i dont hear anything by the end of the week, I'll be contacting kickstarter and my bank. I understand crowdfunding projects take time, but no contact and the fact that this is a preexisting product is making me uncomfortable as to the legitimacy of this project.

The Hyborian

20%+ bigger scale (unless you have a game mechanic where size is bound to the space you fill out with colored tiles - as shown in your new year update), double-sided playmat with stitched edges FTW!
Games like Oathsworn, Aeon Trespass: Odyssey and Sankokushin, which will hit the table often, are begging for a playmat. Regretably, Shadowborne Games didn't offer one with Oathsworn. With plastic minis being moved across the board, after 60+ hours of game time, the game board will see a lot of wear and tear. It's practically unavoidable.
You should definitely consider having one as an add-on 👹

The launch is subordinated to the HIPS sample, the planning of the mold design and number, and the preparations for all the economical/taxation law part. We will never rush a product in the market, as it will simply and directly impact on the backers in a very negative way and it is our duty to ensure a wonderful campaign experience and a tranquil, reassuring wait for the delivery. This is how we always worked so far and we are proud to say that everything always was a great success with full customers satisfaction!
That is why we never planned or released an official date for the launch ;)

In concert with the release of the book, please set up a Patreon channel that charges a few dollars a week for your reviews of non-iTrax recordings (made available by iTrax competitors, labels, or individual artists) that meet iTrax standards. Maybe you could include a teaser list of such recordings in the book.
A daunting array of new recordings are added to the download marketplace every week. Directing your trusted analysis at this ball of confusion would encourage many new audiophiles to grow their music collections and would save many grateful subscribers time, money, and tears.

I'm hoping your book will include simplified sections for non-technical people such as myself. For example. What does a Redbook CD standard look like as an mp3, flac or other type of file? (I.e., what are the bit rate or other easily visible values that I should be looking for.) How can I tell whether a streamed file is at Redbook standard? How can I tell that the file being streamed is sourced from studio recordings made at Redbook standard? Advice for apps or software to monitor streaming quality. Advice for budget friendly equipment to get a digital file or stream into audible sound. And mistakes to avoid in that process. Advice for converting CD's to digital files.
I really appreciate your blog posts and look forward to reading the book.

Thank You!
Your tireless monitoring and commenting on the Audio industry is greatly appreciated.
I increased my pledge once I realized how much money you have saved me by not buying into the latest cable fad. My quest and appreciation for enjoyable HiFi started about 55 years ago when connections and wiring for analog made a difference. Again, thank you for educating me about digital.
I look forward to the next book.
An area that I would like addressed is streaming.
Is it likely we can trust most music will be available for a price to stream, negating the need to self preserve lossless files of CDs and downloads? Do I really need to download files better than Redbook quality?
At the current time, how do I know other than trial and error about media software to play both paid streaming and archived files.
Example, Roon, Foobar2000, PLEX, Amarra for TIDAL
Serato DJ Pro, KODI, JRiver, etc.
Perhaps even some information as to how our hearing changes as we get older.
AT my age I have some hearing loss, yet can still detect nuances in the quality of equipment and source material.
You are the fresh air that the industry needs.

Hi Mark,
Having read your first book I am looking forward to reading your thoughts on the latest developments in audio reproduction. Following your invitation to post requests here are some topics I would love to see them covered in your new book:
Chapter 10 – Personal Audio Basics
• Portable gear: DAPs vs. phone+DAC – any (SQ) differences?
Chapter 12 – Wired vs. Wireless: A Fidelity Reality Check
• Other network technologies: powerline communication (PLC)
Chapter 13 – Components for Downloads and Streaming
• Which digital components influence sound the most?
• Dedicated hardware vs. computer: Are computers really that bad for music streaming (noise, jitter, etc.)? What should be considered for optimizing the computer?
• Do all bitperfect players sound the same?
• Does DAC connection type matter (USB, Toslink, S/PDIF, I^2S)? What are differences in data transmission bandwidth, jitter and noise sensitivity, error handling capabilities?
• What about ‘audiophile’ power supplies, network switches and digital accessories (e.g. USB regenerators, re-clockers, etc.)?
Chapter 14 – Headphones: Stereo and Surround
• What is a ‘flat’ frequency response (Harman target curve etc.)
• Personal HRTF representation, head tracking, other immersive technologies: status quo and quo vadis
Chapter 15 – Content Providers
• Will streaming economically kill artistic diversity, or is a chance for most artists?
• Who is the audience for high quality music sound in the streaming world? Will it remain a niche (or even dying out) or are there pockets of growth?
• Does high resolution audio need to be expensive (content provider economics, incl. hosting & bandwidth costs)?
Chapter 16 – Calibration and Optimization
• Getting engaged in the digital domain: room ‚correction’
- using automatic correction systems vs. manual EQing
- frequency domain and time domain manipulations
- FIR vs. IIR filters
• “Hearing what the artist intended”: how to keep tonal balance even when listening at loudness levels lower than typical mastering levels (80+ dB)?
I am convinced that you had most of these points on your radar anyway, but thanks in advance for considering anything on this list that had not crossed your mind yet.
Mark WaldrepCreator

Thanks for the extensive list. I'll certainly do what I can to address these areas.

Hi Mark,
Nice to see you continuing to help us wade through the crap being spewed by so many out there so that we have an unbiased, intelligent discourse on how and where we can go to hear quality audio! Been a fan of yours for years ever since you attended an audio show in Toronto some years ago. Now, to my question: how will the downloads work? As I understand it downloads are provided from the itrax web site not the AIXrecords site. Is this correct and, if so, is everything that is available on AIXrecords available on itrax and will all titles be available to the backer? Also, on itrax, titles are available in multiple formats (flac vs wav; 2.0 stereo, 5.1 stage and 5.1 audience) - what resolution is provided for the flac downloads and for the download offer, will all formats be provided to the backer i.e. will the backer be able to download both flac and wav (not sure why I would want to do that other than to compare the sound quality) and more importantly download stereo, plus both 5.1 versions?
Mark WaldrepCreator
5 months ago
The downloads will come from iTrax.com which has all of the AIX Records available in a variety of formats and mixes. You'll get a coupon for the cost of 5 albums in any format/mix you prefer. At the present time, the plan is to make available a single mix and single format. I have other free downloads that will let you choose which you like the best.

Hi Mark,
Excited on the option to add 5 albums from the AIX Records catalog.
How will this work? Do we add x$ to our existing pledge. Or will this be an add-on to the survey after the campaign?
Mark WaldrepCreator
5 months ago
Good question. Here's what I found on the KS site:
While a project is live you can adjust your pledge by visiting the project page and clicking the “Manage your pledge"" button. On the following page, select ""Change your pledge"".
From here, you’ll be able to adjust your pledge amount or switch to a different reward tier (changing reward tier will automatically update your pledge amount). Additionally, you’ll have the option to add any add-on rewards, or give a little extra with bonus support.
If you’d prefer not to receive a reward, simply change to the ""Make a pledge without a reward"" tier and enter your new pledge amount.
Remember, when changing your pledge amount you are not adding to your existing pledge, the new amount you enter will be the total amount collected if the project is successfully funded.
Once a project has ended it is no longer possible to modify your pledge amount or reward selection. If you need to seek out an alternative arrangement, we recommend reaching out to the project creator.
Let me know if this helps.

Thanks Nigel. You're No.2 this time...All I ask is that you help spread the word. This will be an important addition to the books on high-end audio. Sorry about the shipping costs to international destinations...it's crazy.

@Mark, as a backer on your previous campaign I wish you all the best for this book. Not certain if I am backer #1 or #2 this time. The high cost of shipping for the book (in my case to the UK) is a shame for both you and backers, but I know how heavy and expensive books are to send and I prefer a hard a copy; fortunately the saving on the Early Bird Special makes a significant contribution to the shipping cost ;-)",26

Is the video already made? I have dealt with significant headaches with visa issues even though I have been running promising startups that have paid Americans salaries (although I can't pay myself). My encounters were so epically frustrating that the NY Mayor's Office called and interviewed me about the struggles I have been through in the past 3 years.
I ask because, if it is still in production, I'd love to be part of it. I already pledged $10 (even though I live on savings), shared this page with my 23K followers, and would love to also be a voice about the frustrations that foreign entrepreneurs face. If the government prohibits us from creating jobs in the US and wants us to start innovation in our home countries, eventually we just might. Right now it's definitely easier making money FROM Americans from Asian than making money FOR them here.

Hi Massimo, first thank you for being the first backer :) The Startup Visa is primarily an interest for the USA (I would even say strategic interest), and I strongly feel that Americans should make a point to their government that it concerns them.
But you do a bring good point, we know greater/better exchange and commerce of goods and knowledge increase wealth for everyone. So foreign governments could play a lesser role. How? Some of them are already heating up the competition with similar programs, it plays an indirect effect of pushing the sense of urgency.
How about having entrepreneur groups and associations issue official statement to their nearby US consulate in support of the startup visa, also maybe those groups could convince their government officials to make a similar statement to the US Ambassador to their country? I don't know how good of an idea that is?

How can we bring foreign governments to push for this Startup Visa?

Ça y est, je l'ai reçu !
Mais quelle déception........
Sur les 4 pièces commandées, 1 est cassée au niveau de la prise, donc inutilisable !
Pour les 3 autres, la prise n'est pas compatible avec une prise française apparement puisqu'il m'est impossible d'en brancher une seule....
Soit il va falloir m'envoyer un adaptateur, soit me rembourser, je suis en tout cas, pour le moment, EXTREMEMENT DECU

Humbug arrived today, but surprise surprise no phone grip. I bought one of these - and I mean this exact model, shape but a red light!!! from China about a year ago. It worked well, in various different properties so I'm sure this one will be ok. It was probably either a Chinese knock off or a per-production unit out for testing. Thanks

Guys, don't know whether this helps, but here are some possible info related to tracking. I say ""possible"" because the tracking email only has a sender's name who I do not know and I think the tracking email is for this campaign is purely based on tracking updates.
Tracking email is from Stamps.com
Sender's name is Edward Mosca
My tracking number is fully trackable till delivered.
I got the email on the 30th Dec.
Hope this helps.

Thank you for that. I checked and it is under ""Games: Subcategory Tabletop Games"" as it should be however we had the same issue the last two Kickstarters. It might just be a Kickstarter algorithm thing. I will contact them to find out. I appreciate you pointing that out.
