About the stl files. Yes in a 3D slicer you can rotate the files but shoyld we have to? It's a bit unfriendly to drop the files unoriented. Would expect them to be as a good product and customer service.
About the 100 different printers and support methods...this won't be a problem if the files were support free, which was the question. Which is not a weird thing, you expect the files to be like this nowadays.

Hi, as a digital file backer I am also not happy and want to support what Vegabond said: „I printed 4 corner pieces and the stone work interferes with a horizontal raised feature on the front facade. It won’t snap all the way in.“
Did you do tests with your prints? As it is, the files are worthless.
Can you please comment on this issue? Thank you.

Hey, Francesgrace and all! So sorry - I am, as I type, prepping another wave of pen pals that came into the community through our recent write-up on Snapchat! Hoping everyone saw it - so cool and they gave shout-out to all of the 150 backers that have made this all possible - yay! So I've been trying to build out a cool new Newsletter and what I probably need to do is just prep a scrappy version that will update our backers of the status. In short, your packs will be shipped in the next 24-48 hours (so excited!) and then the real fun starts. So if I can provide just a small distraction from Election Day chaos, then I can rest easy at night haha! I'll send out an email tomorrow to everyone to let them know that shipment / matching has been accomplished but, yeah, my priority and goal is to get a proper Newsletter (working title: The Pencast) out to everyone with more robust information and sneak peeks! Hope that helps to give some sense of where things are at but also message me with direct inquiries or email at hello@penspluspals.com if there is anything else I can do!!!!

David Crowley

Hi, got my order (His Starter Pack - I actually received them in December but only recently tried them), and I'm very impressed with the materials, quality and finish. One thing though is the sizing - I'd usually wear a S/M (depending on the brands, usually a M which would be roomy) and ordered a M, but they're just slightly too small to be comfortable, or to work really as swimming trunks. I saw you have other men's trunks on your site, but would there be any way of ordering a starter pack again in a larger size? With the shipping costs, it would be just a bit too expensive for me otherwise, but I was happy enough with all the other aspects of them, so I'd take a chance on the larger size if possible. I've noticed you've addressed the sizing issue on your site, and I hope this avoids any further issues for you and future customers, because I really thought it was a great idea and very well done apart from the sizing.

Incredibly disappointed with my items. The idea is fantastic but designed only for stick skinny women. Not inclusive at all sizing wise.
The High Flyer bottoms fit like a backwards thong and after expressing my concerns I was charged full price for a second pair and then have had no communication since.

Hi Dominique, I'm sorry that you're disappointed and taking your consideration into our redesigns! We are getting a new customer service rep and I just went and refunded your order (which was discounted and had free shipping) as if it were a domestic exchange, so we will cover the difference in cost of the international shipping as an apology for this incident. We're changing styles up for the next run to be more flattering on all body shapes based on feedback from KS and that's why your backing and comments are so valuable.

I am extremely upset. I was sent the wrong items in my order. Took forever to get it acknowledged that I was sent the wrong order (I sent proof with pictures and everything). Waited for no response for like 3 weeks. Finally gave up waiting and tried to connect again. Now I am being told I must pay for the exchange? Why? This was not my fault. This was your fault. I didn’t order the wrong sizes, I didn’t send the wrong sizes. Why am I suppose to pay? This infuriated me to no end! If this is your version of customer support, I’m just done with the company. Keep your order. I will never order from you again, and I will highly encourage other to not do business with you again. I have given this process over 3 months to work out (from time of first contacting which was the day my incorrect order arrived). Sheesh, the audacity here.

Hi, I’ve sent at least 3 emails since receiving my Somi in November with no replies. The top doesn’t fit at all. Too big I’m the band like wearing a tiny T-shirt but I’m worried that going down a size will not be enough coverage, is there someone I can talk to about determining the best exchange?

Printed the stuff off and went through it last night. Great stuff overall. I look forward to running this with my regular roleplaying group sometime, and at conventions when they can finally resume.
My only criticism is the choice of including the sax as a possible instrument. We ran through a few alternatives (chainsaw, turntable, moar guitar, moar percussion), but ultimately settled on the electric cowbell.

I decided to NOT get the add-on sleeves - not worth the shipping cost. Can anyone from Lookout confirm the total number of cards for the base game upgrade + expansions + stretch goals ((Ballroom Entry pledge) and the sleeve size? Sorry if this is repetitive, but it's not easy to search through all the comments for this information.

David,
Yours is more accurate. I got it from ""239 + unlocks"" graphic and counting unlocks, but that 239 graphic was probably made at some point after some cards had already been unlocked. I'm glad you took the time to actually break it down. Mine was an upper bound estimate at best.

When is this game set? By the looks of it set in a time when all the people in Austria would have been predominantly white. So the majority of the guests been White is probably accurate.

OK I’m an idiot. I just realized that the anthem pledge does not include stretch goals. I don’t have the base game so I decided to go for this pledge level. In the end I’m paying a lot for just the base game, no expansion, no stretch goals. I didn’t realize what I was doing, but I wanted to help the campaign as well as try a new game. Now I realize I’m getting the short end of the stick. This sucks 😔

I am seeing comments about the shipping charges being higher that stated. I missed the source of this - is this just for add ons, or for the pledge levels as well? This is worrisome, as I am already spending more on the expansion than on the original game.

There are a lot of great online resources that deal with neglected books and forgotten authors. https://neglectedbooks.com/ is one. So is the Buried Books Club on Goodreads.

As a Brooklyn native and Homebrewer (who dabbles a bit with cider, but not seriously), I’m thrilled you guys are opening in Bushwick and will definitely be visiting!
Quick question - do you have a pricing structure or options for add-ons? More specifically, I’ve pledged for a glass, but I’m also interested in an “ugly apples...” t-shirt. Can I just add $ to my pledge for the shirt? Or bump my pledge to the short level and then add $ to that for the glass? You get the idea...
Thanks and best of luck!!

So does that mean when the network infrastructure is updated here on the mainland we would have to buy a new Air with the proven technology inside it? Or will a firmware only update do this? I'm hoping for something future proof. If it can't be updated that'll be a little disappointing as I may as well just stick to the tracker I have now which I have to charge once a week and has a basic pay as you go sim in it.

Received mine two weeks ago. It took a bit longer as the package got opened at the german customs. Maybe the officers didnt know yet what the declared content ""bamboxers"" are. Next time maybe you should declare ""mens underwear"" to speed up the delivery ;)
You didnt promise too much. They are really comfortable, however a bit larger than expected. Would like to order more when you have a german or european reseller to keep shipment costs low. Let me know ;)

Hello Bamboxers team! I too have been enjoying wearing my Bamboxers. When washing I have been washing them cold cold and hang drying par. I feel like they have shrunk a little bit in the legs... Is that something that you'll find with bamboo boxers? I don't like it when my underwear bunches and rides up my leg while wearing pants.
Andrew S.

I've been enjoying my boxers for the past week and a bit. Real easy to get used to and really comfortable. I was concerned with how they would fit, if they would be too loose around the legs and such, but nope they fit great.
My only real dissatisfaction with this product is the fact that the product label isn't properly centered on the back, but that's just my OCD talking.
Otherwise, great product guy! Good job!

We just wrote you back over PM. One of our decisions with packaging was to keep things simple for now and focus on putting our funds towards making the best product possible.

Just got my 15 Pack today. Will try them out tomorrow and see how the feel.
Also, my 15 Pack was short 1 boxer, I sent you guys a private message.
I like how you guys are on top of the shipping. It's really nice to get the product a couple days after you announced you shipped. Also, just one small dissatisfaction, and that's the boxers didn't come packaged, but rather loose in the FedEx bag. Just having them in a separate bag inside there would have been good enough for me.

When I heard that people in a very poor neighborhood in Kolkata are fasting from cigarettes and chai today to support JUNTOS, I was incredibly moved. I was with Joanna when she was 14 and said, ""Mom, I am going to bring a group of dancers to Guatemala when I am 16."" My response, ""Why not wait."" ""No, Mom, I have already found my passion,"" Joanna said. And the rest, many of you have been a part of one way or another.
As you, too, find your passions and invite others into that circle of creativity, friendship building, and connections, I highly encourage you to contribute to JUNTOS collective, and encourage your friends over the globe to do so. This is a new form of community, initiated and energized by emerging adults, who want to create friendships and hope across borders.

As the word of Juntos on KickStarter begins to circle the globe, a group of inspired Indian youth and family members came together to pool their daily cigarette money, chai money, and food money to donate to Juntos. After watching the video clip they were moved to share what they had to make Joanna's project come to life! They might never meet Joanna or the Juntos dancers, let alone see a performance (until Juntos makes it to India), but their belief in this project goes beyond that matter. Please support Juntos and the wonderful work they do!

How is combat handled?
Dallas MixCreator
3 months ago
Hey Seaver,
Combat is handled though the ""checks"" system. If someone wants to make an attack you need to do the following:
Determine situational difficulty, add any relevant modifiers and characteristics, and roll for the outcome. <7 would be a miss, 7-9 would be a hit but with a complication, and 10+ would be a hit without a complication. Damage can be determined by the narrative, or using the damage rule from the GM toolbox.

When Covid hit and everything shut down, my game group switched focus from board games to playing D&D through Zoom. This has been fantastic and we all had an amazing time. Now that the world has opened up, our time is limited, we are having a hard time completing modules. We all have the Role Playing bug so I'm really looking forward to getting this project in my hands as this will get us into the action quickly with lots of options for change of scenery.
Dallas has also ran many D&D and The End of the World sessions for us and has done an amazing job with this. He encourages character development and motivations, and this leads to very memorable events within our games. I really enjoy the way he runs the sessions and look forward to how he implements his skills and knowledge into this system.
I've have also seen other projects that Dallas has worked on in his work life and know that he pays allot of attention to details. I'd be very surprised if this project was anything less than AMAZING!

A lot of love and hard work went into making this game and it shows. I've played this game twice, both with Dallas as the game master. Both times I played it, I had a blast.
I came into Three Step Plan with my main role playing experience coming from Dungeons and Dragons. Compared to D&D, this game absolutely shines in its ability to set up one-shots. I found the character creation elements of this game set the stage to build a universe that drives the characters into and through the story. You could go into this game not knowing what kind of character you want to play, roll the dice, have some laughs, and play the backstory that comes out of it. You could also go into this game with a character in mind, roll those same dice, have some laughs, and get a character mostly like what you want, but maybe that shotgun you wanted was taken by someone else (grumble) and you ended up with a key to the bank and a stick of dynamite... Sounds like the start of a story...
I would certainly recommend giving Three Step Plan at least one playthrough so that you can judge for yourself. I'm confident that if you are looking to have some laughs with friends, it will deliver. I will certainly be leading a session once my copy comes in.
David Wasmuth

I’ve played Three-Step Plan several times. I’ve also game mastered, which is something I thought I’d never do. I’m usually hesitant to play D&D, not because of the role-playing aspect, but because positioning and rolling and attacking end up being the focus. With Three-Step Plan, the story takes centre stage, allowing for a much more entertaining and unpredictable experience. Like in Fiasco, whether you win or lose is inconsequential, or at least victory won’t matter much since it’s all about the journey, not the destination. And the quick-dice-draw character building is super unique and fun. This is a must-own game!
Joe Tomkins

Just like to let those who aren't sure about backing that this a solid project.
I took part in some of the earliest playtesting and Dallas has put together a great system from almost day 1.
Starting with a wonderfully interactive player creation process, the game gets you thinking right away. You've put together not quite a hero, but definitely a character who is motivated and focused on their goal. This is something that just doesn't happen in most RPGs.
Player interaction through the narrative is great as you're not sure quite what secrets everyone has. You may be working with another character just to discover they've been waiting for the right moment for a double-cross.
The settings are just ready for you to craft whatever plan you can think of. The fairly open world structure and straightforward conflict resolution lets players and game masters be as imaginative as they want. Sometimes not succeeding leads to an unexpected path to victory!
All of this packed into a single game session! Everyone I've played Three-Step Plan with has wanted to play again. Dallas has done a great job with his concept and mechanics and put together a terrific game.

If you haven't been paying attention all these years to the interviews and things he's been predicting for years now, you obviously aren't a true fan. For those asking for refunds, you've shown your true ugly disgusting colors.

I do not agree with his political views, but I get he was fighting for what he believes is best. This does not mean I will stop listening to his music. I happily await my reward.

Anyone asking for a refund is a bitch. Jon is not a terrorist. The BLM/Antifa scum who were burning down our cities and looting businesses are the terrorists.
I’m proud to support one of the few non-Leftist scum in the music industry. I don’t agree with everything Jon believes (not a fan of Alex Jones’ theories for instance) but there’s no denying he’s a patriot who loves his country deeply and is sickened by what the Deep State has done to our beloved country.
How about wait until Jon himself makes a statement before jumping to conclusions especially since the Fake News Media glorifies Leftist trash and denigrates patriots and anyone who dares support Trump (who has done more good for this nation than the past three awful presidents combined)?

I believe a lot of people are confused by what has happened. At this point in time we really don't have many details of what actually transpired other then that it looks like Jon may have entered the Capitol building. I haven't seen any evidence of him hurting anyone or causing any sort of damage. For all we know he may have just followed hundreds of other protestors into the building. I admit doing this was probably not one of his better decisions but how can you hate someone that you have been a fan of for most of your life for doing something that he believes in. Its not like no one has ever listened to his lyrics or heard what he has said publicly about his beliefs. I really can't speak for Jon but I believe without a doubt that his heart was in the right place. The media is twisting things and pushing a false narrative. I know you might think I am sounding a bit like Jon hear but it is true. . If you don't think there are crazy things going on lately, you must be living under a rock or simply looking the other way in an effort to deny it. Shouldn't we wait this out until we actually have accurate details? You simply can not believe the major media outlets. They are pushing their false narratives. Regardless of where you stand politically, wouldn't you like the truth to be known? Its not right to assume he did horrible things. Jon is a highly driven person. He does things that most of us can only fantasize about accomplishing. When he has a desire to do something, he goes into it full throttle. To call him a Nazi is just ridiculous. He is just the opposite in fact. He is weeding out corruption and defending freedom. Don't we all want to be free?

30,000 armed troops agrees with you about weird shit amongst a mass of other things. Last I checked, rolling in troops, stifling peoples ability to speak, considering brainwashing camps and removing freedoms was much more Nazi moves than going into the capital with or without permission.
I agree with and have the mans back. I may not understand the purpose of the event but im sure we will find out.

And if it's a different version from the cover I originally ordered, then I will proudly display both. And still support Iced Earth (with or without Jon; still a fan of both), although I'd rather they stay together. Don't let this break you up.

Iced Earth is owned by Jon. He is god when it comes to Iced Earth so as long as hes around I imagine Iced Earth will be too. At least I sincerely hope so.

Hey Jon and Kickstarter, can we get an update on the book? Due to the current events, I doubt that the book will be delivered.

Hey boys! Glæder mig til at dykke ned i Album 2.0 - tænkte dog på om I har nogen planer for at lægge det op som podcast, fx. via itunes eller lignende service? Det skulle ikke være så svært. Det ville være awesome, lige som med de oprindelige programmer!

When we gain some rewards from our action columns, rules say that we can immediately use the rewards for our free actions.
However, later in the rules, it says that the rewards received in a turn cannot be used in the same turn.
Can you clarify ?
