With our successfully funded Kickstarter campaign we are now able to make the world of influencers marketing more accessible and honest. A huge thank you to all the people who have shown their support, backed our project and helped us start The Influencers Movement.\nWith the pledged €10.000,- we are now able to develop the first version of TIM. Also, achieving our goal on Kickstarter will improve our chances of winning the TEDx Amsterdam Women Startup Awards on may 29th. But most of all has this campaign helped us share TIM’s story. Over the past couple of weeks The Influencers Movement did not only get noticed in the Netherlands, but has also set its first steps into the international influencers market. During this movement we have met so many inspirational, creative and positive people. Looking back on our campaign we can definitely say that this experience has been priceless! Well… priceless? It has been worth 10.000 euro’s!\n\nTHANK YOU!\n6\nRead more', 'UPDATE #3\nSecond milestone: We reached 25% of our goal amount!\nDorit Roest & Myrthe StapperCreator\nMay 4, 2015\nDear backers,\n\nAre you ready for our second project update?\n\nAt the TIM office in Amsterdam everything is going great. Apart from the fact that Dorit is enjoying a well-deserved holiday in Spain, our team and loyal influencers are working harder than ever. With 60 backers and counting we have felt a great amount of support. Not only from our family, friends and backers, but we have received many positive comments from influencers both in the Netherlands as well as internationally. Our goal to join forces has been taken to whole other level!\n\nLast sunday we achieved 25% of our goal amount. That means we already got €2500 thanks to all 60 backers. It’s crazy to see how everybody loves TIM and his dreams. 1,5 week ago we sent out our first update to tell you we got our first international backer. Well… we’re proud to say that we now have more than 6 international backers. People from Romania, Swiss, Germany and the US have already donated money. Also, there have been a lot of (international) influencers who have shown their support through , or even in their blogs. We have even received a German blog about TIM!\n\nEven though we are heading towards the right direction, we still need €7500,- to realise TIM’s dream. Therefore we are going to get ready for PHASE 2; PR Engines ON! We are calling out to everyone who can help us establish more publicity. Our is ready on our , our team is on fire and now we need your help. Do you know anyone who could help us turn on the PR Engines? \n\nEvery little bit helps. We are so pleased with all our backers that we wanted to give you something more in return. From now on people who back us for €10,- will receive an awesome TIM bag. So, do you know more people who might be intersted in supporting TIM? Or people who just like bags? Well… I think you know what to do;)\n\nIf you have any questions about TIM or about our campaign, please feel free to ask!☺\n\nOn behalf of our entire team: Thank you very much. \n\nKind regards,\nMyrthe Stapper\nCo-founder The Influencers Movement\n1\nRead more', ""UPDATE #2\nNew reward: Campaign on bloggersnetwork.nl for €450,-\nDorit Roest & Myrthe StapperCreator\nApril 23, 2015\nEspecially for brands that would want to work together with Dutch influencers already: publish a campaign on bloggersnetwork.nl and get to work with 5 bloggers for only €450,-.\nNice additional advantage; you'll be supporting TIM's dream!

This campaign has been an incredibly different experience for me than the first one I created. I know that you have had many concerns closer to the end of this campaign, and you are entitled to have them. There was a lot of misinformation passed around in comment section, and when people do not understand something they tend to foster an accusatory mindset. I did not post very many updates during the time period of receiving the decks and shipping them out because there wasn't any new information to give. I was trying to send out the packages as best I could, and they went out much slower than I was anticipating. Not only was the packaging process time consuming, but the cost of shipping was way more than I expected. I assure you that I have made no money off of this campaign, 100% has gone into manufacturing and distributing your rewards. I actually went into considerable debt trying to get all of these packages shipped out. I am a college student with no job, and so I am sure you can understand how stressful that would be. \n1734\nRead more"", 'UPDATE #17\nALL Rewards Sent Out!\nAddison JamesCreator\nDecember 6, 2019\nHello all!\nEverything has now officially been sent out! \nThis means that everyone should already have the deck in hand or received a tracking number in their email this week. \nI really appreciate your patience in all of this. This was my second Kickstarter for the Visionary Tarot, and even though I had experience from before I was not prepared for such a large response compared to the last campaign. The backer size increased drastically and this caused a larger delay in shipment from manufacturer as well as myself. I truly apologize for the inconvenience of this delay and the stress some of you felt with my lack of communication. \n\n516\nRead more', 'UPDATE #16\nComments\nAddison JamesCreator\nNovember 30, 2019\nThere is a lot of misinformation that has been brought to my attention.
