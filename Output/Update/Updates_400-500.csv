All with thanks to you.  I am truly awed and humbled by the support I have been shown throughout this campaign.\n\nIt’s not easy being a musician today.  It’s also not easy being a Jewish woman in the music world.  That’s a whole other conversation— happy to have with anyone off-line! So to be both a musician, and a female Jewish one to boot, I’ve often been told takes ‘cajones.’  But I believe so strongly in the mission to keep Ladino culture alive, and I also believe that I, as a woman, have a unique artistic perspective to be heard.  I am proud of the fact that this new album is dedicated to my Sephardic heroine, Dona Gracia Naci (see update #1 to learn more about her), and I’m proud that I’ve incorporated some strong feminist inspiration in many of the songs.   \n\nWhen I started my career 10 years ago, Ladino “Rock” was a seeming oxymoron.  It wasn’t often one would hear an oud paired with an electric guitar on a traditional Ladino song.  Somehow I’d like to think I’ve made it work.  Well now I present you with some “Feminist Ladino Rock!”  That’s a combo you really don’t hear too often...  \n\nBefore I present a new song clip, I want to share with you a picture of one of the most remarkable women I know. This is my cousin Rachel (scroll down).  I get choked up every time I talk to her. She grew up in Bitola, Monastir (Northern Greece/Southern Yugoslavia— now present-day Macedonia) where much of my extended family is from (my grandfather was born there, too!).  On March 11th, 1943 Rachel’s family, along with all the Jews of the town, were rounded up and taken away.  Rachel survived.  She hid in a neighbor’s house and when the time was ripe, and with the help of a chauffeur from the Italian consulate, she was transported to Albania in the trunk of a car.  There, she changed her identity and lived in a stranger’s house until war’s end.  She never saw most of her family again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nRead more', 'UPDATE #4\nThe Home-stretch\nSarah AroesteCreator\nDecember 15, 2011\nIn the past few updates I\'ve shared special pictures of my ancestors with you.  Now I want to share with you a picture and a song that truly symbolize why I am so committed to the work that I do.\nFirst the picture: this is the facade of a synagogue that many of my distant relatives helped build in the 1920\'s in Salonika, Greece. For you Hebrew speakers, you\'ll notice the ""Aroeste"" on the sign above the entrance!  As many of you probably know, the Jewish community of Salonika (along with the rest of Greece) was decimated during WWII.  What is less known is that  Greece was the hardest hit country of any country in Europe in terms of the *percentage* of Jews killed during the war.  The community was devastated, along with much of Ladino culture, and to this day it is struggling to rebuild.  I am blessed that my immediate family was safely in America when the war hit.  But many of my distant relatives were not as fortunate. While many of the buildings in Salonika were destroyed in the fighting, this one synagogue remarkably was left intact at war\'s end.  The Nazi\'s used it as a Red Cross shelter, and so it was spared.  To me, the fact that this building was left standing (and is still in use today-- albeit much less) says so much about the resilience of Sephardic and Ladino culture worldwide today.  Our culture is certainly not as widespread  as it was just 70 years ago, but it *is* still standing.  And we are holding on fast, and we *continue* to rebuild.\n1\nRead more']",12
