Our problems won't magically disappear when we roll over into 2021, but it's important to note the milestone... and getting through 2020 is definitely one of those.\n16\nRead more"", ""UPDATE #21\nFrom Long to Short\nMikey LanceCreator\nAugust 7, 2020\nHello backers,\n\nThis being the first official update since lockdown, I hope you are well and have managed to stay safe.\n\nUnfortunately, I'm bringing some news that's upsetting not just for you but for many involved in the project.\n\nOur first cut of the film was extremely long (as you'd expect), something like two and half hours. It included scenes we knew wouldn't make the cut, but that we'd worked so hard on, both in preparation and execution that we left them in. Eventually we got the courage to remove these scenes from the film. This is where we were first introduced to the feelings of loss that comes from 'the edit floor'. It's a painful feeling; seeing the effort of actors, the production team, set location planning and even the time spent editing that scene... simply thrown away. This is the reality of the industry, so we learned to get used to it.\n\nWith this new cut, at about two hours long, I sent it around to a few industry people for feedback. This is where we first got hints that we might have a problem with our film. They gave gentle advice, while inferring to some deeper issues, but none that really came out and said it plainly.\n\nThis is when I started to take on a more aggressive approach while we were editing scenes. I was trying to separate myself from the emotion of the film, the effort, time and money spent. What they call being 'too close'. For perspective, the Kickstarter funds accounted for only 25-30% of what was eventually spent on the film, not that I'm any less grateful, after all, it was literally kickstarted by you as a backer and that initial fund for which the film would not exist at all. As costs increased, I put in as much as I could afford, friends and family helped too, while the bulk came from producer Nicholas Holder, someone equally as invested emotionally as I am. So as you can imagine, it was difficult to keep from being 'too close'.\n\nAfter a long time, we got the film down to 90 minutes. I was proud of the work it took to get to that point. It was a feat in itself, something to celebrate. Even still there was an inkling that something was wrong. I needed more feedback. We did a screening at a local cinema and planned to do another one right after, but reviews were mixed, so that seemed hasty without doing yet another cut. I decided I needed to do something very hard - get the unwashed opinion of someone I respected - someone I hoped would tell me 'like it is'.\n\nI sent the film to a filmmaker overseas, a director,  whose work I hold in high regard. She would not only hold me up in comparison to standards of professionals in the industry, but she would care enough to make sure all those involved in the film wouldn't make a bad name for themselves by releasing something substandard or embarrassing. This was no small request.\n\nShe and another high profile professional provided detailed notes about the film. It was painful to read them, but so very required. What came out was that I had made two major mistakes early on in the project, before filming began, that had a cascading effect over the entire film. These mistakes left the viewer feeling detached and dissatisfied by the end of film. I hope you'll respect me not going into detail about the mistakes, but rest assured, they were my decisions and I am to blame for them.\n\nWhat was recommended was to turn the feature length film into a short film, selecting only the best parts to form a snappier, more positively impactful narrative. We are in the process of doing this now. Currently, we're down to a 20 minutes in length, looking to cut a further couple of minutes, but we are very close to a final cut.\n\nI am truly sorry to those expecting, as I was, a full-length feature. Trust me when I say no one is more disappointed than our team and me at myself for making these major mistakes. I've learned so much in the past few years, and especially lately, about trusting my gut feelings. But it's not all doom and gloom. The film is coming, the rewards are coming (finally) and this project will be wrapped.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nTalk soon,\n\nMikey\n35\nRead more"", 'UPDATE #20Backers only\nProject Note (not an official update)\nMikey LanceCreator\nMay 12, 2020\nThis post is for backers only\nIf you’re a backer of this project, please log in to read this post\n5', ""UPDATE #19\nA Silver Screen Learning Curve\nMikey LanceCreator\nDecember 28, 2019\nHi guys,\nAs the year is wrapping up, now's a good time to share what's been happening.\nSince the last update we've been editing in our new scene as well as trimming and cleaning others - we're still fighting being an objective viewer after seeing the same scenes dozens of times each, and the film as a whole multiple times over. \n8\nRead more"", ""UPDATE #18\nThe Scene That Got Away\nMikey LanceCreator\nOctober 15, 2019\nHello Backers!  \nHope you're doing well.  \nWe've just finished shooting a pick up scene with Craig Hubert and editing it into our timeline has already begun.  \nThis particular scene has always been part of the film, but it lacked development.

We could not have done this without you. We conducted more than 40 interviews in four continents highlighting 13 social movements over the past century, a one-of-a-kind endeavor. As we noted in the original Kickstarter campaign video two years ago, our founders warned that America is a fragile experiment.

We started this journey two years ago because we could a sense a growing number of people were unhappy with the lack of progress being made on several issues. We did not know which might tip the scales to unrest and the country does not need another two white guys to say what needs the most attention. So instead of adding our critique to the status quo, we decided to see if we could help those seeking change to amplify their voices and direct their efforts more effectively.\n4\nRead more', 'UPDATE #11\nFirst draft is one month away!\nSurmountableCreator\nMay 3, 2020\nBackers, we hope all of you are safe and sound.

We can now safely say that the book will be 15 chapters in total.\nWhile we may self-publish to have a final publication in time for the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, we are doing our due diligence to create an extensive proposal in case we decide to pursue a longer, more ambitious route.

However, we will not quite hit our projected goal of publishing in 2019.\nWe were perhaps too efficient with travel by staying only 2-4 days in each locale across four continents. That was cost-effective and made the most of the funds raised on Kickstarter but still required many more follow-up interviews than we originally expected. Transcription has taken us longer to complete than anticipated, as well. We are leveraging an amazing app called Otter which gives us a rough cut of our interviews and helps us focus on the most important dialogues.

Try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and every molecule in your body exploding at the speed of light. Lets not cross the streams. I wanted to write a quick post about the Ghostbuster documentary ""Cleaning Up the Town"" and our Ghostbuster fan documentary ""Ghostheads"". I have noticed a lot of comments online trying to decide what side to take on the Ghostbuster documentary front, and I wanted to be the one to say there are no sides but only one big team. I have known Anthony Bueno, director of ""Cleaning Up the Town"" for many years and even had him one my Ghostbusters themed podcast a few times. Anthony even helped me when I first wanted to make the movie we will be releasing this summer. Anthony has even filmed an interview for us and will be making an appearance in ""Ghostheads"". We are making two totally different movies. They are making a movie about Ghostbusters, which I personally cannot wait to see (as well as back via their Kickstarter), and we are making a movie about the fans. This is not an ""Armageddon"" and ""Deep Impact"" issue. What made the Ghostbusters so good is they were a team that came together, our movie is about the love of the movie and how fans are a big family. There is no need to pick sides, we are all in this together. Lets take a minute to celebrate that in 2016 we are getting three really great GHOSTBUSTER movies. (Please, no need to make reboot comments now) Lets celebrate the original movie in two completely different ways. CLEANING UP THE TOWN and GHOSTHEADS!!!

We could not have done it without you.\n\nIf you're wondering where we are in the film process, we haven't started shooting yet. It takes a couple weeks for Kickstarter to process payments, backers to correct any payment issues, and then finally for Kickstarter to send the money. Since we need to buy some equipment (in particular, lights) to get the best footage, we're waiting until that money comes through to get rolling. \n\nThat doesn't mean we're doing nothing, though! There's a ton of preproduction planning and design work to be done, so I've been immersing myself in that. \n\nAlso, to keep everyone updated, to keep myself honest, and to provide a record for other people who might be interested in making a film like this, I'm going to be chronicling the film process and what I'm doing in a Youtube series called Doc Vlog. The first episode of that, which is about lessons from previous projects that I'll be bringing into this film, is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw3ucqdVo0g&feature=youtu.be\n\nThere will be many more episodes in the future, but I probably won't announce most of them here, so if you want to stay up to date you may want to subscribe to that Youtube channel. \nRead more"", ""UPDATE #3\nWe did it!\nCharles CusterCreator\nAugust 23, 2017\nOur Kickstarter campaign has officially succeeded!

In addition to sketching out a rough outline, I've also started sketching down some ideas and some theory behind the way I want the film to look visually. Part of this Kickstarter is going to go towards buying a few lights so that (when we're not on the mountain) I'll have a lot more ability to control how shots look, and I'm really excited about some of our early design ideas for things like interview lighting and sets.\n\n1\nRead more"", ""UPDATE #1\nReddit AMA\nCharles CusterCreator\nAugust 16, 2017\nGot questions?

DeLucaCreator\nSeptember 20, 2010\nPeople In Space has been on the ground in Shanghai for 6 weeks, collecting information and inspiration to bring back to create our exhibition in the US!\nFor the last week we have been amongst the millions of Chinese citizens and international travelers making pilgrimages to the Expo to pay homage to China and fuel its nationalism. Some seek innovation, entertainment and novelty, and some attend for no other reason than to have gone. Perhaps it was just excellent marketing, advertisement, and a good brand name?\nWe have spent extended days at the Expo, conducting interviews, implementing surrogate performances, experiencing select Pavilions, and collecting countless images of an “imaginary” creature by the name of Haibao, the official Expo Mascot!\nShanghai and the Expo is teeming with kitsch, absurdity, novelty and often surreality. During our most productive week on the ground, we have negotiated within this environment that has proven to be an enlightening platform for ephemeral art actions. We have scratched 70 backs of people waiting in line, interpreted a DNA strand through a crowd, and created a collective symphony of sound through clapping, whistling, and finger snapping. We have accumulated dreams of the future, learned to write “People In Space” in Chinese characters, and we have spent hours in exhausting lines to better understand the action of waiting.\nWith an event so large it’s impossible to see everything even in a week. Just like the other visitors we have to come up with a way of deciding which pavilions to enter. Often rumors, propaganda and price tags are the most significant filters for people. We have followed suit and go where the people go, but have also followed our own noses to some of the more unnoticed aspects of the Expo experience. This has provided insight and access into spaces within the Expo we never expected to enter. While implementing Jeff Byrd’s performance, we ended up in a break room designated for Expo volunteers. We were able to successfully implement his performance here, while engaging in dialogue about ideas around the expo. The volunteers were so excited by this project that they rewarded us with popsicles in addition to their participation!\n\n\n\n\nRead more']",1
